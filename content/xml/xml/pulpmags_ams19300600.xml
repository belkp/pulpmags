The re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quirements of manufacturing, building and traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly appeal for larger use of power. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">general way we may classify matter under three</seg><seg type="columnLine">principal divisions : solid, liquid, and gaseous. The first, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we know is rigid, requires force to break it or to bend it out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape. It seems to present itself as the best material for exer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cising force and developing power. Solid matter used in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arts and in mechanics is generally metallic, and of all the metals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those wife the iron base are tlie most used. Bui there is very</seg><seg type="columnLine">little iron in the world and when the iron mines are exhausted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is hard to say what will be done. But fortunately, in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all tlie machinery we see about us, the total amount of iron used</seg><seg type="columnLine">is very little, comparatively speaking. If man were dependent</seg><seg type="columnLine">on iron as such for his source of power, he would very soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaust the supply. But of the three states of matter to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">used for the development of power aud the exercise of force and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure often of enormous amount, curiously enough man has to</seg><seg type="columnLine">utilize the invisible, light and tenuous gaseous form of matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This form of matter is without tensile strength, and is almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">indefinitely compressible. We live in an atmosphere of gas, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">air is a mixture of gases aud seems the least likely thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginable as an instrument for exercising power or force. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is really curious to follow out what this light invisible gaseous</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing docs under proper conditions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Going back some two thousand years, we are told that Nero</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Alexandria devised the first steam engine. Hia boiler was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted so that it could turn and when heat was applied and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam pressure produced, one or more pipes leading from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiler permitted steam to escape tangentially, so that the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, boiler and all, whirled around at a great rate So we sec</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mankind long ago grasped the idea that a light invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas could be made to develop power. For steain is a true gas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a little over half as heavy as air and is just as invisible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To propel projectiles for hunting or for war, tlie_ muscular</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of man was first used in throwing the javelin, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting the arrow from the bow, in projecting stones by hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">or by sling, and by throwing clubs and boomerangs. Then when</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger projcctilcs were thrown as in attacking cities and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortresses, machines were made which could throw large stones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the construction of which mechanical means were employed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the art of killing your fellowman and destroying his</seg><seg type="columnLine">structures, received its greatest perfection, when, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles, instead of mechanical means, gas was used to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">projcctilcs out into spacc. The bullets of rifles, the shells of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannon, some of which in the World War were thrown a</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance of seventy five miles, rising to a height of twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles in their flight, are all discharged by gas. Reaching their</seg><seg type="columnLine">destination, shells, which may be a foot and a half in diameter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are exploded with tlie most destructive cifects, by the simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">expansion of gas within them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A boat may be rowed or paddled by hand. By giving it_a sail '</seg><seg type="columnLine">we say the wind blows it along. But the action of the wind on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sail is simply the pressure of gas against the sail, for air is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect gas. In former days, a sailing vessel that would cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Atlantic in two weeks, acquired a celebrity for speed. Now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a steamer goes across in about five days, driven by enormous en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gines and their power is due purely and simply to the pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gas against the pistons of the cylinders or against the wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">or buckets of turbines. In turbines we are coming back in a sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Hero's engine of twenty centuries ago. All engines, steam</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines or internal combustion engines, operate purely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply by gas pressure; by pressure of the one kind of element</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seems utterly unadapted to exercise such force. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure used in tlie steam engine of its various types is due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas. In the internal combustion engine such as is used in</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobiles, the pressure is produced by exploding a mixture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of air and gasoline vapor in the cylinder. The explosion takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">place with great readiness because of the large quantity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrocarbon gas mixed with the air to at least start the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion, whose heat converts instantly the rest of the gasoline</seg><seg type="columnLine">spray into the form of gas, so that it will burn with such readi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness as to constitute an explosion. And here we come to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">■curious thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The explosion of hydrocarbon gases under various condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, involving of course, the ignition of a mixture of a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bustible with air, may be very violent, and may be simulated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixing a very finely divided combustible powder with air, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine division of the combustible, giving it a certain approxima-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the gaseous state. We have explosions in flour mills,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the air charged with dust forms an explosive mixture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is even said that the Diesel engine, which burns heavy oil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be driven by dust fuel, so that one might drive a ship across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean, using barrels of flour instead of gallons of oil, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is certainly a rather amusing suggestion. But the pressure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive the engine would be that of gas produced by the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bustion of the finely divided solid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gunpowder, whether the old-fashioned black mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixture of carbon, sulphur and the "villainous saltpeter," or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern chemical compounds, all depend ior their action upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the production of gas. And this invisible light substance, ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely without strength of any sort, develops power and force</seg><seg type="columnLine">which can produce the most appalling effects. It is almost a</seg><seg type="columnLine">contradiction of mechanics that such a thing as gas can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it does in the way of developing the most intense strains</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forces known to mankind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It may seem to be a side issue but gas is used to cut great</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel beams and other steel and iron forms. The little gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowpipe produces intense heat, but this is not enough to cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel. But by giving an excess of oxygen to the blowpipe jet an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxidizing flame is produced. When this impinges on iron or</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel, it burns it literally, converting the surface into fusible</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic oxide, which as fast as produced flows away like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid, exposing_ a fresh surface, and more iron is burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. In this way a channel is cut through the heaviest</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam in a few minutes. The blowpipe can even cut steel deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">down under water. _</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the competition between the airplane and dirigible, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advocates of the plane may exult in not requiring gas. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is the air, which is a gas, which supports them. They arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">upheld by the pressure of a gas.

"Even if that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible--which it is not, owing to a dozen reasons I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could present--your machine would not remain poised</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stationary while the earth revolved beneath it. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, not unless the. gravitation was cut off over the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of tlie earth, in which case everything would fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">off and join your floating ship. And that, my friend, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I say my discovery might prove a curse instead of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a blessing. I can eliminate or perhaps better counteract</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gravitation, for as a matter of fact the force I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolated acts from the outer space downward or rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">inward instead of from the earth outward as everyone has</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumed. I can, I say, manipulate this force to a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent, as far as it affects any small body of certain sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances, among which is lead. Possibly I can best make</seg><seg type="columnLine">my meaning clear by comparing my newly discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">force to a beam of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By means of a convex lens a beam of sunlight may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated upon an object--let us say a bit of lead--</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the metal will melt, yet outside that concentrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam the sunlight has no such effect upon other bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead, in other words, by means of my apparatus I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent a ray or a beam of force from acting upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain object, although everywhere about it--outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere of effect of my apparatus--the force remains</seg><seg type="columnLine">unchanged and objects remain in silu. And above a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain distance from the earth's surface my apparatus fails</seg><seg type="columnLine">to control the force, just as the lens would fail to concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate the light beam beyond its proper and established</seg><seg type="columnLine">focus."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mmra," I mused, "I think I understand; but I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">you move the lead to right and left. Why can't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">cany it a bit farther and move it to any extent? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">why shouldn't your apparatus be set up in an airship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus be used to nullify gravitation as it proceeds, even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were compelled to remain at a fixed distance above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir Esme smiled condescendingly. "All very well in</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory," he said, "but not in practice. The effect of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">device is--well, I might say, to create a hole in the gravi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tational force. If the apparatus were placed in a vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you suggest, this 'hole' would extend not only down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward towards the earth but upward as well, and the result</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be that your ship and its apparatus would remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">in statu quo; in other words the reversed effect on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side would counteract the effect on the opposite side. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, I am not at all sure that the object might not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely disintegrated; I must try that experiment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, my dear sir, in order to operate, my device must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed on the surface of the earth, and even then it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be insulated by means of an alloy I have discovered. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">like many inventions and discoveries, this one is only</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful on a small scalc. I can raise that half pound</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of lead as you see; but I cannot budge a mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighing ten pounds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why can't you increase the power of your machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">in proportion to the weight of the object?" I asked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head. "No use" he declared positively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've tried it and it doesn't work. No, the whole thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in its experimental stage and it's a beastly dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to experiment with, unless the greatest care is used.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If it were made public some consummate ass might suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceed in eliminating gravitation over a considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">area. Think of the result in that case!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well it's darned-weird--downright uncanny," I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at the bit of lead still poised midway between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table and ceiling. "And it seems to me there must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">some use--some value to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eventually perhaps," he agreed, "but it would amaze,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and many other laymen if you knew how many aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishing scientific discoveries are made, which are relegated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the limbo of forgotten things, merely because they can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be put to any useful or valuable purpose.

"Quite so," he agreed. "But"--with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh--"what use is revolution unless something is gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereby? However--" he paused and gazed contem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">platively at the floating picce of lead--"somehow I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeling, a hunch as you Americans would express it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there is something back of it, that I am on the eve of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great discovery; a great truth that will startle the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should say that the discovery you have already</seg><seg type="columnLine">made is quite startling enough," 1 told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Harvey, an Enigma</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SIR ESME'S lapses into his scientific personality</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very irregular, and often, for weeks at a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earl's Court laboratory was dark and deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to all intents and purposes Alexander Macdonald</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to exist. Again, Sir Esme McDonald would van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish quite as completely as if the earth had swallowed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and for days or weeks lie would be lost to the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he buried himself in his scientific researches. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never knew when he would be at his laboratory, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no wish to intrude myself upon him, it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed that when he was in the Earl's Court house and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished my companionship, lie would notify me. Among</seg><seg type="columnLine">his other idiosyncrasies was a detestation of the telephone</seg><seg type="columnLine">that amounted almost to a mania. Although for business</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other reasons phones were neccssary in his home, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather in his various homes, he never permitted the instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments to be within his sight or hearing and never used</seg><seg type="columnLine">them himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a long time before I learned the reason for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly unreasonable prejudice against telephones, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was at a total loss to account for such an apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridiculous attitude on the part of a man of Sir Esme's</seg><seg type="columnLine">character and mentality until a mutual friend explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir Esme's only son, the heir to his fortune and his title,</seg><seg type="columnLine">(the Baronet was a widower) had been instantly killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an airplane accident, and the tragic news had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicated to him by telephone. The shock was, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, overwhelming, and I could well understand why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after such a harrowing experience, he could not bear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments that were constant reminders of the tragedy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I could not blame him for his attitude. I mention</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fact because it had a rather important bearing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">events that I am about to relate. Owing to this feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the part of my friend, it had been arranged that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should communicate with me through his man, Harvey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old and trusted retainer who had admitted me to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earl's Court laboratory on the occasion of my first visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harvey was a most remarkable personage, and as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">played an important role in our adventures, a few words</seg><seg type="columnLine">in regard to him are essential.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE was, I should say, a man of sixty, about Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esme's own age, and had been picked up, lashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rude raft of wreckage in mid-ocean, by Sir Esme, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cruising on bis yacht. When rescued, the castaway</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been unconscious. For days he had hovered on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">verge of death, and when he eventually recovered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">health and strength, his mind, as far as his past was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned, was a total blank. He could not recall his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">name, the name of the vessel that had gone down, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accident occurred nor any other detail of the past. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain Sir Esme and innumerable specialists tried to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">store the man's lost memory, to reawaken his mind. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">him life began with the hour of his recovery aboard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loch Lovern, Sir Esme's ocean-going yacht, a splendid</seg><seg type="columnLine">five-masted bark, for Sir Esme was a true sailor and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no use for steam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that the man had been at sea or was a seaman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon evident. He seemed instinctively to know the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">and location of every line, sheet, brace and halyard aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yacht; he could navigate, and every now and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashes of past knowledge and experiences would come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, surprising himself as much as others. For example:</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one occasion, as the yacht was making a strange port,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie cautioned the sailing-master to keep a trifle more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">starboard as there was an unmarked rock on the port side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the channel. Another time, when running for shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">under double-reefed topsails in a typhoon, he declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a safe harbor and secure anchorage lay behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooded point</seg><seg type="columnLine">At times, also, he exhibited a knowledge of matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of an education that had no place in a seaman or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's officer, and that puzzled Sir Esme tremendously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not that he could converse on such matters nor discuss</seg><seg type="columnLine">them intelligently or at length. They were mere flickers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious or perhaps better, subconscious, glimmers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things familiar to him in his former existence; fleeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories gone almost as soon as they were formed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">naming of some strange bird, beast or plant; a reference</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some important date or event of the past, a quotation</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some classic or poem, the mention of some person</seg><seg type="columnLine">or place, and on one occasion, when Sir Esme was</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzling over an abstruse mathematical problem of</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomy, the factor by which the problem was solved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was, in fact, a man of mystery, and Sir Esme, as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Harvey himself (a name he had taken by choice) had</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted days and weeks to searching the lists of crews</seg><seg type="columnLine">and passengers on all vessels that had been wrecked or</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported missing at the time when he had been picked up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one who answered Harvey's description had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost so far as could be determined, and the only vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had disappeared with all on board, and of which 110</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete list of passengers--if she carried any--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew was obtainable, was the Santa Incs, Spanish vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">plying between Vigo and the Canaries and which, by no</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility, could have been within a thousand miles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot where Ilarvey had been found adrift upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of wreckage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is almost impossible for a normal man to fully realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Harvey's condition meant in life. He was like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">infant transformed by magic to a fully developed man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an untutored savage whisked by a miracle into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of civilization. Everything, even the commonest</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyday matters were, to his mind, absolutely new, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I must qualify that statement somewhat. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could recall nothing of his past, though his life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">world began--as far as his consciousness went--011 the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NON-GRAVITATIONAL VORTEX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">203</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Loch Lovern, yet certain features of his past remained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could read and write; he spoke several European</seg><seg type="columnLine">languages fluently, and in his educational attainments he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the equal of the average high school boy. But such</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters, as well as his knowledge of everyday affairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">food, clothcs, behavior, etc., seemed instinctive. So, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although he could not recall ever having seen them, rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way trains, motor cars, all the modernities of our civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion seemed perfectly natural to him. But dates, events,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the World War, the most important occurrences prior to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rescue, were absolutely unknown. At first he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been very sensitive in regard to his condition, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided other men--though fairly worshiping Sir Esme</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and had consequently developed a taciturnity, a shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of aloofness, of silence and of impassivity that sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded and enveloped him like a coat of mail. Even to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir Esme he was inarticulate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had insisted from the first upon being Sir Esme's</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant, his very shadow. It was hopeless for the Baro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">net to attempt to dissuade him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as he was at a distinct disadvantage among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other servants on Sir Esme's estate or in his various es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tablishments, the Baronet hit upon the plan of taking him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his confidence, installing lum as the sole servant in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret laboratory and making Ilarvey the valet, but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler, care-takcr, guardian, assistant and general factotum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Alexander Macdonald.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He felt that with Harvey the secret of his dual person-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ality was safe, and Harvey seemed lo accept the anoma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous condition of his master as perfectly natural. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">never addressed the Baronet or referred to him as Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esme or My Lord. Always it was "Sir" or "Mr. Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">donald" or "Mr. Alexander 1" And to Sir Esme's amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, Harvey, without any instructions or suggestions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been perfectly at home among the delicate and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicated scientific devices and apparatus in the laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">and observatory. As though he had all his life been quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to such things, he knew the purpose, the use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of everything, aud when, out of curiosity and as a test,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Baronet--or as I should call him Alexander--gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him permission to make use of the equipment, he dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered to his utter astonishment that the memory-dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">man possessed a subconscious and quite inexplicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the. sciences that was almost equal to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own. The tiling was the more amazing as Harvey could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not himself give any explanation of why or how he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, that or the other. To him the word electron meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, yet like an automaton or a man under hypnotic</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence he produced a device by which he secured a</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographic record of an electronic How on a metal disc.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When Sir Esme--no, Alexander--mentioned the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellation Aries, Harvey's face was a blank, yet he readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unhesitatingly adjusted the telescope to precise po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition to bring Aries into the field of vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He is the most amazing person in the world, really!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir Esme declared, when he told me of Harvey's history.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He must have been a man of the highest attainments in</seg><seg type="columnLine">general science yet, as far as conscious knowledge is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned, he is ignorant of the very rudiments of science.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you know, I would really give a great deal if I pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed a knowledge of psychology, so I could devote my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to studying him. It is for all the world as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">living in a dream--acting, moving, carrying on while</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep, yet talking, behaving, living his ordinary life as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though wide awake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But though I forbore to say so, for I was not quite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of my friend's psychological condition or his knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of his own dual personality, Harvey to my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no greater mystery than his master. The one pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed two distinct personalities, each conscious, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other possessed two egos the one conscious and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other sub-conscious. For that matter I was not, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even yet am not quite sure if the Baronet was fully con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of the existence of his two selves. Never, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was Alexander Macdonald, did he refer to Sir Esme</seg><seg type="columnLine">McDonald save as another and wholly distinct individual.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even when he was telling me of Harvey's history he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not speak in the first person, but narrated the story ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly as if telling of some other man's experiences. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not say "I picked him up at sea." He said, "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was picked up by Sir Esme McDonald." And when my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend was in the role of Sir Esme, never did. he refer</seg><seg type="columnLine">by so much as a word or a hint to Alexander Macdonald,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scientist. So, after all, perhaps of the two men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir Esme was the most amazing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to go back to where I stated that it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed that Sir Esme--yes, I shall refer to him as Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esme--was to notify me that he would welcome my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany at his laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was several weeks after I had witnessed his amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment with the bit of lead when Harvey rang my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell and announced that "Mr. Alexander" wished to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">me at the Earl's Court house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well, Ilarvey," I said. "Tell him I'll be over in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour or so. I have an appointment to meet some</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends leaving Victoria station at ten. Then I'll go</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct to the laboratory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harvey hesitated a moment, his sphinx-like face be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traying nothing. Then, with a typical butler's cough. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">beg your pardon, sir," he said. "But I would suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you should come at once, sir. I--well, sir, to tell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth, Mr. Alexander seemed greatly excited, sir, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">most anxious for you to join him at the earliest possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity, sir. I trust you will not consider me pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumptuous, sir, but if you could find it convenient to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">my master first, sir, and to keep your appointment later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir, 1 would advise it, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, never before had Harvey made such a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech. Never had he offered a suggestion as to my or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir Esme's actions, and I felt sure that some most impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant matter indeed must be afoot to have caused him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak as he had. So, filled with intense curiosity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn what had excited my friend and why my presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so essential, I scrapped all my prearranged plans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped only long enough to phone my departing friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">that T would be unable to see them off, and with Harvey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried to the Earl's Court laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Positive Signs of Success</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HARVEY had not exaggerated. Sir Esme was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than excited; in fact for a moment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared that something serious had happened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was ill or deranged. He was wild-eyed, his hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dishevelled, and he was pacing nervously, excitedly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down the hallway, puffing furiously at a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe, and muttering, exclaiming to himself. But at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance he wheeled. His eyes lit up with pleased recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nition. The next instant he was almost forcing me down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hallway and into his library.</seg><seg type="columnLine">201.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank heaven you're here!" he cried. "It I'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">compelled to keep this to myself much longer I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone mad. I must tell someone, and you're the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one I could think of, could depend upon, could trust.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By Gad, no one else would believe it! But you--" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed hoarsely--"you're no scientist, so you'll believe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your mind is open--free of hide-bound prejudice. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't yet believe it myself.

"It sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">too preposterous, and when I have told you, and if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe it, you won't wonder I'm almost mad; in fact I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not blame you in the least if you think I am mad."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, with a great effort calming himself: "It has to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that same force," he said, "i've been experimenting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">testing, but it was Harvey who gave me the real idea, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">real suggestion--Harvey and you, my friend. Really I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">take no crcdit whatever for it. I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The old story of fools rushing in, eh!" I laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not fools," he retorted. "Harvey's no fool and-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am," I interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He chuckled in the old way, and I thanked heaven his</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnatural excitement had vanished. "Not a bit of it, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jove!" he declared. "The scientists are the fools. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously, do you recall your remarks about my discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery? About objects flying oil into space and so on?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And do you remember that T stated that I could lift</seg><seg type="columnLine">an object only a certain distance? That I could lift only</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects of definite weights ? That my apparatus operated</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon or repelled the force for only a certain distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over a definite, restricted area?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again I assented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was the fool," he exclaimed. "But Ilarvey brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to my senses. He was watching my experiments and</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered as if to himself 'vortex.' 'What do you mean?'</seg><seg type="columnLine">I demanded. Poor Ilarvey winked his eyes, gulped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to come out of a trance. He didn't even know</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd spoken. Then suddenly, like an inspiration it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. Vortex! Whirlpools! Whirlwinds! Like a flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">I understood! The force I had discovered, the force that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the real source of gravitation, when repelled by my</seg><seg type="columnLine">device acted like a vortex--a whirlpool--but a reversed</seg><seg type="columnLine">vortex. Do you understand ? Do you see ? My instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment represented the apex, the point of the vortex, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbance of the force, that spread out like a cone as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascended, like--well, like any other ray, like the beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown by a searchlight. You remember I compared my</seg><seg type="columnLine">force to a beam of light when I showed you the floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of lead--" he laughed--"but I liad 110 idea, no con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception at that time of the exactness of my simile. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as a ray, a beam of light--for that matter just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound--thins out, becomes weak, in ratio to the square</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the length of its radius from its origin, so this force</seg><seg type="columnLine">01 the area--the base of the inverted cone of influence--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ot the interrupted force I created, became thinner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fainter, less powerful in ratio to the square of the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance from its origin and its angle of--well, I might say</seg><seg type="columnLine">locus. No wonder my lead rose to a definite height and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">remained there. No wonder I could not lift an object</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">exceeding a certain weight. I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on!" I ejaculated. "You're getting too involved</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me to follow. I grasp the cone idea, but I don't see</seg><seg type="columnLine">why, if you used greater power or force or a larger appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus or whatever you may call it, the cone or vortex</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be proportionately increased in force and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lienee a larger weight would be lifted to a greater height,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ah, but my dear sir, that was just the trouble," cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir Esme. "When I increased my power, as you call it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I merely created a more widely diffused disturbance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the force. It was analogous to using a more powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">light in the searchlight but also using a wider distribut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lens. There is greater light to be sure, but it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread by the lens to a wider angle and throws a beam no</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther than the smaller light with die smaller lens."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 SHOOK my head in despair. "Now let me get this</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight," I begged him. "One moment you com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pare your force, no, the area wherein the force is nulli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied, to a vortex or a 'cone. But the next moment you state</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the objects affected rise or move away from the apex</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vortex. I thought, in the case of vortices, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was drawn from the edges into the apex."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir Esme gazed at me pityingly and I knew he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the fool he had once denied me to be. But he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very patient, now that he had relieved his pent-up feelings</seg><seg type="columnLine">by discussing the matter with me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't intend to convey the idea that the affected</seg><seg type="columnLine">area--the force-vacuum as I might express it, was ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tating, whirling like a true vortex," he explained. '"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no reason to assume or to think that there is any</seg><seg type="columnLine">such movement taking place. No, the very reverse is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case; the object affected is the moving object Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you--of course you must have witnessed the feat of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">motorcyclist driving at top speed around and around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior of an inverted, conical track. Or, to put it even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more simply, you know that a sharp curve on a road</seg><seg type="columnLine">should always be banked. You must be familiar with so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called centrifugal forces, the tendency of a moving object</seg><seg type="columnLine">to slide off to one side when traveling in a circle. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is what occurs when I operate my repelling device. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">object affected races about the invisible circumference</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the inverted cone of forcc-vacuum and so mounts up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, just as the motorcyclist rises swiftly towards the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">top of his conical enclosure. But-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But--" I interrupted him. "The lead most certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not move. It remained stationary. It rose straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg your pardon, but it most assuredly did not,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he declared. "To your eyes, to mine it appeared to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. But the human eye is incapable of registering motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond a certain--and very moderate--speed, just as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human ear cannot register seund above or below certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">limits of vibratory waves." "You mean to say--" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began, but he checked me with a gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," he cried. "You cannot see a rifle ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing through the air. You cannot distinguish the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual spokes of a rapidly moving wheel, yet you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have observed that in motion pictures the spokes of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel on a moving motor car often appear to be sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionary or to move in-the reverse direction. And if a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk or a ball is rotated extremely rapidly no human eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">can determine whether it is stationary or is rotating. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this case-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Granted that I might not detect its motion if rotating</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NON-GRAVITATTONAL VORTEX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">205</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on its own axis, I assuredly would have seen it ii it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved about the circumference of the cone-like area," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">argued, "For had it moved about with sufficient speed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have rendered its travel invisible, the object itself would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been invisible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sir Esme chuckled. "Your reasoning- is remarkable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for a non-scientific man," he told me, ''but you forget,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or perhaps I forgot to state, that the cone of force-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vacuum is so small--its diameter so small--that your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">argument docs not hold. The diameter of the cone of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">affected space is, at the limit reached by the object, pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cisely that of the object, or at the most, only slightly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">larger than, the object itself. The moment the object</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attains to that point it mounts no higher. Consequently,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as it races madly--probably thousands of times a second</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--around the circumference of a cone no larger than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">itself, it practically rotates upon its own axis and hence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to our eyes it appears to be stationary. Ah, I know, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I very foolishly touched the piece of lead while poised</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in air and the thing shot off with centrifugal forcc with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the speed and power of a bullet. Why, by Jove, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smashed two beakers to atoms and penetrated an inch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of deals! Thank God it had the good sense to fly away</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from me, or rny experiments would have ended then and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Hmm," I observed. "But why doesn't the thing rise</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">higher--up to the limits of the cone of--er, what "you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">call force-vacuum ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sir Esme shook his head. "I am not quite certain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">myself," he admitted, "but I think it is because the fric-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion or the resistance is greater than the lifting power of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the affected area. It is in a reverse way somewhat akin to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the phenomenon of a falling body. Theoretically, a fall-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing body should increase its speed as it drops--that is,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tlie farther it falls the faster it should fall, hut as a matter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of fact, owing to friction and resistance of the atmos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">phere, its speed, after a definite fall is reached, remains</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">constant. But that, my friend, is where I have made the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great discovery, tire discovery that so excited me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Good Lord!" I exclaimed, "I thought what you have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">just told me was the discovery. You don't mean to tell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me there is more coming!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This is merely the beginning," he assured me. "The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">real discovery came through a device by which the focus,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if 1 may so term it, of the repellent area was intensified--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">exactly as you or I or anyone can focus the lens of a lan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tern or a stereopticon. And by increasing the focus or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the intensity of my repellent beam as the object ascends,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I can send the thing racing upward for an indefinite dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tance--for all I know into space itself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Then you could project a vessel or a device into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">space so the earth would rotate beneath it and the de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vice--the vessel--would, in effect, travel westward at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one thousand miles an hour," I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ko," he declared, "that is impossible. The repellent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beam would have to follow the object to accomplish that,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the beam is fixed--it is projected straight-radially,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the earth and at right angles to the earth's surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But--" Sir Esme paused, leaned forward and spoke im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pressively--"I have discovered a most astonishing and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yet logical thing. If an object is lifted by my device to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a great height alx&gt;ve the earth, it either completely van-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ishes or returns to the earth at a spot some distance from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where it started."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "WhatI" I ejaculated. "You mean you actually have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, well--er, blown things into spa.ee!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I cannot positively say," he replied. "But I do know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, in several instances, objects fell back to earth sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral feet--even a number of yards from the point where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I projected them, while others, projected to a greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">height, have never returned."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> i laughed. "Pardon me," I cried, "but that does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove that they actually vanished. In fact your state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that some fell back at a considerable distance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you sent them soaring indicates to my mind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others merely descended beyond your sight or hear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. But come, where and when did you make these</seg><seg type="columnLine">tests? I'm mighty sorry I could not have seen them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lie grinned boyishly. "I--or rather we, for I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">include Harvey--conducted them on Sir Esme Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donald's property in Yorkshire. There is quite a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake in the midst of the moor--a lonely uninhabited</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot--and once I discovered that tlie objects did not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to their starting point, I made use of the lake in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order, if possible, to determine if they descended near</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if so at what distances from the apparatus. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, I thought at first it might be tlie result of wind or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other simple causes. But I soon determined to my en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire satisfaction that they fell always northwest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of departure, and that the distance varied in exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratio to the intensity of the nullifying beam employed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that proves my contention," I interrupted. "Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were sent highest fell proportionately farther away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out of your range."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head. "I thought so myself--at first,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie said. "But the strange feature is this. I adjusted--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or I might say graded--the focus so as to project the</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects (in this case they were iron cubes) higher and</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher by degrees. In cach case the cubes fell back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proper ratio of distances until a ccrtain power or</seg><seg type="columnLine">focus was used, whereupon none returned. Now, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear sir, you must admit that if it was simply a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their falling so far distant that they were beyond our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ken, there would have been intermediate falls, just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were intermediate beams used. And--" Sir Esme</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned forward and tapped my knee for emphasis--"a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of the cubes--those that fell farthest away--</seg><seg type="columnLine">were partially disintegrated--the comers, the edges were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom away! I am sure--I feel positive that the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rotation of the objects increases with the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached above the earth, and that at a certain distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rotation speed becomes so great that the objects are</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely disintegrated--blown to atoms. No doubt,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued, "various substances lose their cohesion at</seg><seg type="columnLine">various heights--they must of necessity, as their tensile</seg><seg type="columnLine">strengths vary--and I intend to make exhaustive experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments covering this feature."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wonderful!" I declared, "but pardon me if I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind you of it. You stated that many wonderful discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eries possessed 110 real value. And personally I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what value this discovery possesses, if, as you say, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing is liable to go to pieces, and the most that can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done is to elevate an object and let it drop back to earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir Esme rose, stuck his hands in his trousers pockets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed once or twice at his pipe, and gazed steadily at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me from under knitted brows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The value is," he announced in level tones, "that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery will, unless I am vastly mistaken, solve some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the greatest mysteries that continue to confront the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human nice."</seg><seg type="columnLine">206</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Explaining Mysterious Disappearances</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a moment I stared at him, almost convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was not quite himself.

I was by now almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain he had become mentally unbalanced; oil the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand I thought it might be only the strain of hard work</seg><seg type="columnLine">plus the excitement over his discoveries.

"How can-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he did not wait for me to complete my question.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course you wouldn't." he cried.

In other words, my friend, I believe that, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">nalurp, under certain conditions, in certain places and--</seg><seg type="columnLine">thank God--very rarely, gravitational vortices are</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed precisely like those my apparatus produces, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a far larger scale.

But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do know that they do occur. And I base that assumption</seg><seg type="columnLine">on two basic facts. First, what I know of the phenomena</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have artificially produced, and second, because there, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other plausible theory to explain certain occurrences</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we know take place and have taken place for ages--</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far back as there is history.

So I invented Alex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ander Macdonald the scientist and--" he smiled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes twinkled--"so thoroughly did I become</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alexander, or perhaps I should say so thinly ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neered was Alexander by Sir Esme, that hi time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">became, to all intents and purposes, two distinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">personalities.

"Don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember," he queried, "that I explained that the weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the object lifted or moved depended upon the size of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the area where the force--no, confound it, the Esmeism,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was absent or interrupted? The effect is precisely as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">a magnet were suspended above a bit of iron or steel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The larger the magnet the larger the piece of metal it can</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift, or perhaps I might better say for purposes of expla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation that the same magnet that would lift twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds, if within a few inches of the object, would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">move that object if separated from it by a few feet. Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">again I might compare the area of eliminated Esmeism</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a beam of light as I have done before. A beam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light may be focussed to a point upon an object or it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be widely diffused over the same place, and so it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the case of these inverted, cone-shaped areas or vor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tices of atmosphere freed, by some unknown means, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the force that is called gravitation. But with a great dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference; whereas the diffused light is less powerful than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the concentrated light, the reverse is the case with Esme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ism. See--" he sketched rapidly upon a sheet of paper--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"here we have two inverted cones, one with its apex just</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching a plane, the other like an inverted, truncated</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone with a considerable portion of its section touching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same plane. You readily see that in the first case</seg><seg type="columnLine">only those objects directly under the apex of the cone</seg><seg type="columnLine">would fly upwards, whereas in the second place all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects that came within the area of the truncated cone's</seg><seg type="columnLine">section would be affected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, in my experiments I have always, necessarily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">been operating with a vortex whose apex represented my</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus, and hence only very small objects directly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">line with tlie apex were affected. But in nature, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rase of the phenomena that I am sure occur, a consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erable area may be affected, and hence large--extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumbersome objects, such as entire ships may be relieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all--well, gravitation, as it is called. And unques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionably, in nature, as in my experiments, the force, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather the absence of force must vary."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," I objected, "Although I can quite understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that, yet I cannot understand how a mystery such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the Murie Celeste, or of Harvey, or even the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of a single human being, can be explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">by your theory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Theory, bosh!" he exclaimed impatiently. "It's not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a theory it's a demonstrable fact. And why, pray, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not those mysterious occurrences explicable by it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," I said, "I'm not a scientist as you know, Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esme. But it seems to me that in any of the cases I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned, or in any similar case, the results do not fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause, if I may put it in that way. For example, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mane Celeste was in perfect condition, not a thing dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed aside from the fact that all human beings were</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing. And in the case of a man or woman vanish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--as many have, I admit--how could one individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">be whisked away from a populated spot without others</seg><seg type="columnLine">being disturbed, without someone witnessing the marvel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous occurrence and without the victim making an outcry?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as far as whirlwinds--tornadoes--waterspouts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showers of fish and such things are concerned, why they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been otherwise explained long ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir Esme burst into hearty laughter. "Of course they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have!" he cried. "So has the matter of gravitation, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">volcanic eruptions, of sun-spots, of electro-magrfetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">force and scores of others. But do you, does anyone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">recall a single explanation that has not upset some prior</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation that had been accepted as incontrovertible</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact? Not a bit of it. Man puzzles over some phenome-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non in nature; he manufactures a theory, an explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seems to fit the facts, and until some other man dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covers the truth--or hatches a more plausible theory'--</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone swallows it and is satisfied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because an apple fell on Sir Isaac Newton's head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his curiosity was aroused; apples, all other objects,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped towards the earth, so naturally--he and his fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowers--argued that everything must be attracted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, and they christened this purely theoretical attrac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, gravitation. But it never occurred to any of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the same results would follow if the objects were</seg><seg type="columnLine">impelled or pressed towards the earth from outer space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, indeed, because man--yes, even scientific man--can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not readily conceive of anything earthly being subject to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ex-terrestrial forces, everyone looked to poor old earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the source of the force that caused the apple to fall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But that does not answer your questions, your doubts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Can you not conceive how, if you, if I, were walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">along or standing"still or were sitting here and one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those inverted vortices of interrupted force--no, Esme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ism--should by chance form directly above you, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">its apex was poised directly over your head, you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sucked up as it were, without in the least affecting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me, here within a few feet of you? And--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes," I interrupted, glancing unconsciously up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward as if half-fearing the tragedy might be hovering</seg><seg type="columnLine">over me, "but would not my chair, the rug, the floor, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth directly underneath, also fly upward?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SIR ESME shook his head. " "Not necessarily," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared. "If the apex of the vortex, as I must call</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--though it is not a true vortex--if the point, the focal</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, as I may say, was upon you, nothing beneath you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be disturbed any more than a beam of light con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated upon a sheet of paper and burning a hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the paper would burn objects beneath it and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tlie focus of the light beam. But should the apex of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vortex be beneath you then, my friend, you, your</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, everything movable within the area of interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esmeism would, as you say, go soaring upward."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd get a nasty blimp when I struck the ceiling," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed, "or would a section of the ceiling and roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanish and leave a clear exit for me ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, that is a rather remarkable feature of the thing,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he replied.

As he spoke, he pressed a switch; the iron cube</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped back with a hang to the low table where it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">originally rested, and Sir Esme produced a sheet of thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">cardboard with long cords attached to the four corners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fastening these to hooks in the walls, he suspended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pasteboard sheet above the picce of metal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," he remarked, "if I produce an Esmeismic area</seg><seg type="columnLine">to indude both the iron cube and the suspended card,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what do you imagine will occur?"

Naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">the uppermost sheet will bisect the imaginary cone where</seg><seg type="columnLine">its diameter is greater than where it is bisected by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower sheet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Precisely/-1 he agreed.

"Now watch," he cautioned me, and once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">set his concealed apparatus in motion. Now I had, I felt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun to grasp the whole idea. I had begun to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishing feats he performed as a matter of course, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had told me should have prepared me for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">results that followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet I could not repress an exclamation of wonder as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first cube flew up and, at the same instant, three of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cubes upon tire cardboard rose as if possessed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">life until they rested against the upper sheet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir F.sme's eyes twinkled under his bushy brows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Funny stunt, as you Americans say, isn't it?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled. "But do you notice that the three cubes resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the second barrier are more widely separated than</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they were placed upon the first ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had not noticed, but now that he drew my attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it I saw he was right. "Pin sorry I cannot mark their</seg><seg type="columnLine">precise positions," he said, "but the confounded thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">is still too uncertain and in too much the experimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage to permit me to insert my hand or any portion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my anatomy within the sphere of the vortex.

I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have no intention of doing so--just at present," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured me. "But as I was about to say. if I could mark</seg><seg type="columnLine">the positions of the cubes, it would simplify matters for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you.

"And" he continued, "you noticed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereas only three left the first sheet and the others, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few inches further from the center, were not disturbed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all those that were resting on the second sheet were lifted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although several were twice the distance from the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sheet, as were the others.

But I think it a sort of 'ground-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing' if T may use the term. In other words I believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">any object connected, ever so lightly, with objects out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the sphere of the vortices, is, so to say, grounded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those outside and hence is not affected.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, had I placed a dozen or more sheets above my</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus, the cubes, if placed upon the highest sheet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would scarcely have been affected. Now of course with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the influence reversed, coming from outer space towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth, this might not be the ease. Yet I am convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it is and I am convinced that it is due to these still</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious and inexplicable laws of Esmeism that, in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases of vanishing persons, ships, et cetera, all have taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in the open air. I do not know of a single case of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">human being vanishing when within a building."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All very well and good, Sir Esme," I assented. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am still harping on the same subject. Can you give me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a logical and lucid explanation of how or why the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings on the Marie Celeste vanished without any por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the ship being disturbed, provided they were, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you claim, carried off by one o-f your Esmeismic cones</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming over the ship?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course I can!" he declared. "It's very simple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I'd forgotten to mention that in the course of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">tests and experiments I discovered that the susceptibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of various substances to the release of Esmeismic force</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">varies greatly. Organic matter is affected much less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">inorganic matter for example, and metals are affected</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than wood and other substances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '•'That fact has a great bearing upon the baffling mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teries you mention.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marie Celeste passed through or came within the area of</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence of one of these vortices--one of minor intensity</seg><seg type="columnLine">or power, as I might say; but which was sufficiently pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erful to cause all human beings on deck to be carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">into space--together with the dog and cat (you remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber they, too, were missing) And-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on!" I interrupted. "How about the men below</seg><seg type="columnLine">decks? And how about objects on deck?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No doubt," he continued, oblivious of my interrup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, "any persons who may have been below deck came</seg><seg type="columnLine">on deck owing to unwonted sounds or possibly cries. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel sure these vortices move about, and it is quite pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible that in this particular case the persons were not all</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted into air at once, but some were seen to vanish by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their terrified comrades who, paralyzed with superstitious</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, made no attempt to escape a fate of which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were totally ignorant.

"I am convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harvey was upon that Spanish vessel that vanished, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing no trace. I believe that the ship came within the area</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an Esmeismic vortex; that it was swept upward, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that portions of it:-including Ilarvey--were dropped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the sea a thousand miles from the spot where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship vanished."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was absolutely dumbfounded at Sir Esme's words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That any sane man could propound such a wild impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible theory, even if his deduction in respect to the Marie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Celeste and other mysteries were corrcct, seemed abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely preposterous, yet Sir Esme seemed sane, normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and absolutely sincere. In fact he appeared to sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing very remarkable, and certainly nothing incred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible in his amazing statements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord, man!"

"How could he--how</seg><seg type="columnLine">could any man--survive such an experience?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men have survived worse," he commented laconically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And the very fact that he was nearly dead and had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">all memory proves he had undergone some terrible ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience, something worse than mere immersion in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropical sea for a few hours. Everything points to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth of my deduction. Did I not tell you that the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects I projected to extreme heights ahvays fell back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth at some distance to the southwest of the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">whence they departed ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I have made careful calculations and am positive</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a vessel, lifted or propelled or levitated--whichever</seg><seg type="columnLine">you prefer--at the position in which the Santa hies was</seg><seg type="columnLine">or should have been at the time of her disappearance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have returned to the earth--in case she returned at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all--in or very near the precise spot where I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harvey floating on his bit of wreckage."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NON-GRAVITATIONAL VORTEX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">211</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," I objected, "In that case why were there no</seg><seg type="columnLine">others--no other bits of wreckage to be found? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">why should the ship or anyone on her return to earth ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Admitting, for the sake of argument that your theory is</seg><seg type="columnLine">correct--that the Marie Celeste, the Santa lues, any ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other objects, were lifted, whisked into space by such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a phenomenon, why should they or any portion of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to earth ? Why, Sir Esme, that would defeat your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own arguments. Tf such were the case, why is it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of the persons who have vanished--the crew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Marie Celeste, for instance, have ever been found ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plenty of reasons and logical ones," he declared posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively. "An object--even a ship, drawn or forced or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever you may call it, into tlie air by one of these.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esmeismic vortices if, in the center of tlie area, would no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt be lifted so far that it never returned, or it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be completely disintegrated by its inconceivably rapid ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation; whereas, if the objects were near the outer edges</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vortex, so to say, or if the vortex were weak or, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">very probably occurs, the area of Esmeism is merely tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porary and of brief duration, Lhen, in cither case, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects might be lifted for only a short distance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be dropped back to earth. T can perhaps make my</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning clearer by calling your attention to the phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomena of a whirlpool. Although many objects may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn into its center and sucked down forever into its</seg><seg type="columnLine">vortex, other objects are constantly thrown out, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">after being caught in the rotating currents, escape and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drift safely away. Such-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But even if the objects that had been lifted did drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">back they would be shattered by the impact with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth or sea," I exclaimed, cutting off his words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled and shook his head. "On the contrary, ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects levitated by the Esmeismic vacuum do not drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with any force,'' he informed me. "You may not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have noticed it, but if you had given the matter atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion you would have observed that the iron blocks, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits of lead that I caused to rise in the air fell back</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently with 110 appreciable impact upon the table below</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. That is a most remarkable feature of the action</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It appears to me that the area of Esmeism cannot be</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly replaced by the normal force but regains its</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal state rather slowly, thus allowing suspended or</seg><seg type="columnLine">levitated objects to sink back almost as if they were be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lowered by mechanical means."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had not noticed this feature of the experiments he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made for my benefit, but now that he called it to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind I remembered it was so. The lifted cubes of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">had struck the ceiling with quite an appreciable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forceful impact, but they had dropped back to the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no noise, and as I recalled it, as lightly as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been bits of cotton. In that case why shouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">a human being be projected upward and dropped back as</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently as though attached to a parachute and uninjured?</seg><seg type="columnLine">But to be carried a thousand miles before being dropped!</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was too much. But Sir Esme was again speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's so remarkable about it?" he demanded, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading my thoughts. "There are plenty of authentic in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances of men, of animals, even of young children being</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled into the air by cyclones or tornadoes, carried a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile or more and dropped unharmed. And if my con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusions are correct--and I am sure they are--cyclones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tornadoes, waterspouts are all merely the manifestations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these same Esmeismic vacuums. And if you or any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else can suggest a more credible or a more reasonable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hypothesis to account for the disappearance of the Marie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Celeste's passengers and crcw, I should like to hear it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It isn't as if her case were the only one. Tlie same thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">has occurred repeatedly, and when a mysterious, inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicable tiling of that sort is repeated, we may feel sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is the result of some natural, if unknown law of na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. Can-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean to say there have been cases similar to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Marie Celestef" I interrupted. "I always thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">hers a unique mystery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bit of it," he declared. "Why only recently--</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than two years ago--the crew of the Kobenhavn</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished in the same baffling manner.

"And in that fespect only did her</seg><seg type="columnLine">case vary from that of tlie more famous Marie Celeste.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The latter ship was picked up and towed into port</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereas the Kobenhavn disappeared--foundered or went</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore--and was lost. But-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There doesn't appear to be anything mysterious in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that," I observed. "I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so fast 1" he warned me. "The ship, as I say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lost--but, long before she was lost she was seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailing, unharmed, without a soul oil board."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean--" I began, but he checked me with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On January tlie twenty-first, 1929, the Kobenhavn</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed the island of Tristan da Cunha under single jib,</seg><seg type="columnLine">foresail and lower topsails. She passed the island within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter of a mile from the shore. She was seen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched by the islanders, several of whom possessed ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent glasses, and to their utter amazement not a liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing soul could be seen aboard and no man was at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's helm! She came very near striking a reef but was</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried aside by a veering of the wind and the current</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vanished in the mist. But all agreed that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">uninjured, her sails, as far as seen, were whole, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">furled canvas was in perfect shape, her boats and deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">liltings were in place, although she was slightly down</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the stern. From that day to the present, no sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlie great ship nor of her crew of fifty naval cadets has</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever been found. She left Montevideo 011 December</seg><seg type="columnLine">14th. On December 1st she radioed that all was well, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on January 21st, she was an abandoned but seaworthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel with sails and all intact. Had she been picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up she would have proved an even greater mystery than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Marie Celeste, but beyond doubt she went down soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">after passing Tristan. An unmanned ship has little</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of surviving long. And there is another ease I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might mention--that of the steamship Eltham that sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Swansea in November, 1928.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! there was a case that in some respects resembles</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the Santa Ines and Harvey.

And if we search through the maritime</seg><seg type="columnLine">records, we will find hundreds, thousands of cases of ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sels reported as missing, of which no trace ever has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found, and yet vessels that were staunch, sound anil were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in the vicinity of storms when they disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Collisions might account for them or-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In which case the vessel in collision would have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported the accident," he reminded me. "And," he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, "although I am very familiar with ships and ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping and maritime casualties, I do not recall a single in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance where two vessels disappeared coiucidently in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same vicinity, as would have been the case had there been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a colllision that scut both to the bottom. No, my friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my theory, or rather my discovery is the only plausible</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation.

How else can you explain such mysterious dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearances as that of Dorothy Arnold, our country-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, who vanished in broad daylight in New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cily, leaving no trace? There are. scores of similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases. I kuew personally of one gentleman who van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished as completely and even more mysteriously in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">West Indies, and who--now you may not believe this</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I can readily verify my statements--was seen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken to' by a policeman at a spot more than twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from where he disappeared, within ten minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">after he vanished! And exactly as in Harvey's case, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed numbed in mind, dazed, completely out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. Unfortunately he disappeared the second time--</seg><seg type="columnLine">though that was easily explicable, for he was seen at die</seg><seg type="columnLine">verge of a treacherous lake and in his mentally chaotic</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition no doubt was accidentally drowned. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, on at least two occasions, I know from trustworthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">observers, that people who vanished--actually one might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">say before their comrades' eyes--disappeared in whirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-like columns of sand and dust; exactly what might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be expected as a result of one of the Esmeismic vortices."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good Lord!" i exclaimed.

He was dealing with a new force, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown conditions, and very largely everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory and guesswork. But he had made exhaustive tests</seg><seg type="columnLine">with smoke and had proved beyond question that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">appliance was incapable of creating the so-called gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional vacuum or of lifting objects when the area above</seg><seg type="columnLine">was filled with even a small amount of smoke. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained it, the smoke--composed of course of impal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pable motes of carbon--acted as a sort of coherer or</seg><seg type="columnLine">binder to retain the Esmeism, although he frankly ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted this explanation was mere theory. The insulator,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other hand, served as a sort of condenser or</seg><seg type="columnLine">shield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a most difficult matter for a layman to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, for he was dealing with the absence of a force</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of its presence, and while I could conceive of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray, a wave, almost anything being reflected from an</seg><seg type="columnLine">object or absorbed by it, my mind could not adapt itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the absence of a force, a vacuum as it were, being re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected, absorbed or acted upon in any way. The trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that my mind--although T knew better--would in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sist upon retaining the impression that the areas where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esmeism was non-existent were areas of actual vacu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">um--nothingness--whereas, as a matter of fact, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were identical with the rest of the atmosphere, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NON-GRAYITATIONAL YORTEX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">215</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that within them there was no gravitational pull (I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus express it, although it was no pull but rather a push,</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to Sir Esme) and they might be compared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy areas where there were no light waves or areas</seg><seg type="columnLine">of atmosphere where electro-magnetic waves were ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent. But revolutionary matters that upset all precon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived ideas are always difficult for the ordinary non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific mind to grasp, especially when our senses--</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight or hearing--cannot be brought into play. But as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir Esme very pointedly and succinctly put it: it didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">make any difference whether or not I understood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter as long as he did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, he had collected--from what sources or how, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord alone knows--dozens, hundreds of authentic rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ords of inexplicable disappearances, happenings and acci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dents which he attributed to his discovery. lie had se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured data of every cyclone, tornado and water-spout</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been recorded by die mctcorological bureaus of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States and foreign governments, innumerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">excerpts from ships' logs, and he had delved into tradi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and history, searching out accounts of similar phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomena.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All these he had correlated, tabulated and arranged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had indicated them upon his chart until it was cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with dots and numbers. He was as delighted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a child with a new toy to find that his theories were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne out by all this; that they were, so he assured me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">portions of the sea and of the land where his areas of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esmeism were so numerous and of such frequent occur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rence as to be almost constant, whereas in other sections</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were practically non-existent, and he had worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and plotted by curves that made his map resemble</seg><seg type="columnLine">a weather chart, dicir movements, for he was now posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive that he was correct in his assumption that the areas</seg><seg type="columnLine">did move. Not only that; he had, being intensely inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested in astronomy, worked out a theory that the areas</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a direct relation to planetary conditions, and he abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely astounded me when, a day or two before we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sail, he declared, apparently in all seriousness, that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his opinion the phenomena were not natural but were</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced by the inhabitants of another planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Why not?" he demanded when I derided this idea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What do we know of the other planets or their inhab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itants? It is absolute piffle to assume that any of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not habitable.

Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas are. merely phantasmal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He snorted. "Why?" he again demanded. "I'll tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you why you and others assume such a stand: merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">because you are judging or rather imagining all intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence, all life, by the life on earth and by the intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is intelligence?

In the case of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is, I grant. Why? Because man's intelligence ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his life, can manifest itself only by means of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical organic thing we call a body. But does that</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove that equal or far greater intelligence might not</seg><seg type="columnLine">exist without anything we would recognize as a body?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Because we humans--in our terrestrial life--require cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain conditions, certain chemicals and elements--certain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">temperatures in order to exist, we jump to the conclusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the same rules and laws hold throughout the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For all we know an intelligent inhabitant of the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">might feel the same way about us.

Why, confound</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all, man, an inhabitant of Mercury, or even of the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might argue that our old earth is dead and cold, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared to his abode, as the moon appears dead and cold to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Or, vice versa, beings--intelligences--upon one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cold planets might regard the earth as an uninhabit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able glowing mass in comparison with the conditions he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would require for existence. You smile! .Very well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let me tell you some actual facts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An^ ordinary fly--any ordinary insect, even microbes</seg><seg type="columnLine">or germs, as well as plant life--die instantly if immersed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in boiling water. Can we leap to the conclusion that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, plant or animal, can exist in boiling water? Not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of it. In the West Indies, in various parts of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, there are insect larva:, as well as plants, that not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only exist in but actually require boiling water. I myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen bubbling, boiling, steaming, sulphur-impreg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated pools and geysers fairly swarming with insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">larva and filled with water plants. To them, water of</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal temperature would be as cold as ice water or</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid ice to everyday forms of aquatic life. Take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other extreme. We have insects--a dozen species at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">--as well as plants, that exist, thrive in snow, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrivel and die if exposed to temperatures above freez-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. And if one form of life can dwell in boiling water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and another requires freezing temperatures right here on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, what right have we to assume that nature--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creator--did not people the planets with forms of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligent life adapted to the conditions there? I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UT you forget that here on earth we have atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere--oxygen, nitrogen, water--regardless of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temperature, whereas-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whereas," he burst in, "on the moon there is no air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no water. Piffle! Because wc--because earthly forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life--need certain combinations of certain elements,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon argue that there can be no life, no intelligence with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out them. Just as well argue that because man, horses--</seg><seg type="columnLine">any land animals--must have air, tiiere cannot be life</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sea, or because fish die when taken from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, no life can exist on land. No, no, my friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble is man is such a damnably self-centered, ego-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tistical, self-sufficient creature that lie cannot--save in</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare instances--conceive of anything, no, not of any con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition, that is totally foreign, in complete opposition to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own surroundings and cxistencey. Why, man alive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he--you--no man can visualize or imagine an intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">being totally, absolutely unlike anything we ever have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. Take stories of interplanetary travel for example,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you ever read such a story? Did you ever see a pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture illustrating such a story--wherein the author--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells or Verne--described or pictured the inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">of another planet as wholly unlike, anything on earth?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course not. Always there is something familiar about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.

So I maintain that all the planets--even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars--are inhabited, and I still adhere to my belief that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these areas of Esmeism are produced by the intelligences</seg><seg type="columnLine">on some uliter planet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For what purpose?"

"Very pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly. But on the other hand, they may merely -be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of accident--the result of activities on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. Very possibly the force--Esmeism--is of vital</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance to the inhabitants up there. Very possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have been using it for inconceivable periods--draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it, extracting it from the space or from the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets, just as we humans extract nitrates from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something like boring for oil," I suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir Esme nodded. "A rather far-fetched simile and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet excellent," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I laughed at a rather quaint conceit that occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.

If the beings who are responsible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">these phenomena did not produce them with the purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of securing specimens froin our planet--er, well--some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing after the manner in which we dredge strange speci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mens from the depths of the sea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely," I cried, "you are joking.

"It's all quite beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">me," I declared. ."I can never grasp these relativity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth dimensional ideas. Let's get back to earth. What,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every-day language, do you hope to accomplish by</seg><seg type="columnLine">your cruise? What is your purpose? Even if you find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darned things, what are you going to do about them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My purposes are manifold," he replied.

I may not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunate enough to locate one of the areas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Or unfortunate enough," I suggested.

"But by study and observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion man has learned to minimize the dangers of earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quakes and hurricanes, even though he has not been able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent them. If I could learn the laws, the actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts regarding these areas, why mightn't it be possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prophesy where and when they are likely to occur</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus enable others to avoid them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," said I, "sounds like the most sensible and</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehensible idea you have propounded.

Do you know I'm beginning to--well, almost to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope we do run across one of the devilish tilings."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Caught in a Vortex</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I boarded the Loch Lover-n for that mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orable voyage that was destined to end in such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing and incredible manner, I found that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht had been completely transformed. She had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a most luxuriously appointed craft, a floating palace al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most, provided with every device and accessory for</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement, comfort and whiling away idle hours and</seg><seg type="columnLine">days.' But now I found her--although outwardly no</seg><seg type="columnLine">different than before--stripped of all superfluous fittings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a floating laboratory in fact, and equipped with scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments utterly bewildering to me and that must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost Sir Esme a fortune. Sir Esme was not one to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything by halves. Once he had merged his personality</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his life with that of the fictitious Alexander Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">donald, nothing, it appeared, mattered, aside from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">one obsession to learn all it was humanly possible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leam in regard to liis suppositious areas of Esmeism.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say suppositious, for while I had become a convert</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the theory in a way, and regarded the existence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esmeism as proven beyond question, still I did not feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was as yet any proof of the actual existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the areas Sir Esme was about to hunt for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I am free to confess that, had I been convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their existence--or had I dreamed there was the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motest chance of our locating them--I most assuredly</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have accompanied Sir Esme on his remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--as I considered it at the time--Quixotic cruise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not that T consider myself less courageous than the aver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age man, and certainly not because 1 overvalue my life</seg><seg type="columnLine">or go out of my way to avoid risks. On the comrary I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have always been something of a fatalist, and in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">years spent in wild and savage places risks had been as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much a part of the day's work as meals or sleep. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">requires something more than mere physical courage to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face some unknown, mysterious, almost uncanny and</seg><seg type="columnLine">supernatural danger, and few men, I believe--and I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">personally I would not--would knowingly rub elbows</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a tornado or a water-spout merely in order to study</seg><seg type="columnLine">its habits or idiosyncrasies. And if Sir F.sme's non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NON-GR A VITATIONAL VORTEX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">217</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational areas existed, they were a thousand times</seg><seg type="columnLine">more dangerous, more uncertain and yes, more uncanny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any tornado or water-spout that ever existed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir Esme, however, although absolutely convinced ol</seg><seg type="columnLine">their actuality, possessed the true scientist's sublime</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage when it came to delving into the mysteries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unknown. And his one consuming desire was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate one or more of the areas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oddly enough, too, he had no assistants--if I except</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ilarvey--although knowing him and knowing the ego-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tism of all great scientists, it was not so strange after all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frankly--and I have had 110 inconsiderable experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them--I have yet to meet the true scientist who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not inordinately jealous, suspicious and fearful of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one appropriating, his ideas or discoveries. They guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">their work and their experiments as if they were the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">priceless and coveted riches, and yet, in the end, give</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to the public without recompense. And in Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esme's case there was another reason. Like many men</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was extremely sensitive to ridicule. He would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">my humorous observations, my flippant treatment of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">theories and reasonings in good part because he regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as more or less of a fool; because I made no claim</seg><seg type="columnLine">to being a scientist. And yet, at times, I quite inno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently and unconsciously wounded his feeling by my atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude. And I am quite certain that had he been ridiculed</seg><seg type="columnLine">or scoffed at by a real scientist, it would have been more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he could have endured. Moreover, he had Harvey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Harvey was more than an assistant, more a co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worker, I might say, quite efficient scientific to his finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tips, ever suggesting and aiding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For the first few days after we left port the two were</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy arranging and adjusting their instruments and</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipments, testing them, unpacking cases and getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything in readiness for use, while I--being passion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately fond of the sea---enjoyed the ship and trip as I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised Sir Esme I would; enjoyed his cigars and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquors and enjoyed the excellent means, for Sir Esme's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mania for science did not extend so far as to interfere</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his fondness for good living. Though the yacht</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been stripped of non-essential luxuries in fittings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no changes had been made in the steward's department.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To be sure, I offered to aid him and Ilarvey with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific stuff, but my offer was politely declined. So,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having nothing better to do, I passed the time, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loch Lovern sailed steadily towards the Canaries, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping a journal of the voyage and in writing--while it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still fresh in my mind--a brief account of the inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dents and events that had transpired--a work which has</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the foundation for the present narrative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Until we sighted Teneriffe the cruise was without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any particular interest--nothing unusual occurred and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat to my surprise, Sir Esme did not as far as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know make any attempts to locate the areas for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in search. But on the seventh day out he had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht stopped and throughout the day he buried himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid his instruments. I saw little of him except at meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, when he informed me that we were on or near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the verge of one of die localities where the phenomena:</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be expected. But to his obvious disappointment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and somewhat to my relief, nothing came of it and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">again began to cruise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was 011 the tenth day that, seated on the after-deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking and lazily watching the soaring man-o'-war</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds, the sky suddenly was blotted out by a dense cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke that poured from a row of pipes that pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jected from the deck-houses. Almost instantly the vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">was enveloped in almost total darkness and at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant I felt a distinct shock, a shudder of the vessel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if she had struck some bit of floating wreckage, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps better, as if she had been proceeding under</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and her engines had suddenly been reversed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly realization came to me. The smoke could</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean but one thing: that Sir Esme had detected the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of one of his Esmeismic areas and was attempting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to safeguard the yacht and those upon her by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his smoke-screen. And as I realized this a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripping fear came over me. I felt cold shivers chasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down my spine and I sat tense, every nerve</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained and on edge, waiting I knew not what.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It is difficult to describe my sensations, difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put into cold print the feelings that raced through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain as I sat there in that semi-darkness upon the yacht's</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck with the heavy smoke-pall blotting out sea, sky, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the masts above me; in a silence that seemed uncanny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knowing that close at hand, perhaps hovering over</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head, was the strange, mysterious, incredible vortex</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might at any instant sweep the ship with all 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">board into space. I felt like one who, having scoffed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghosts, is suddenly confronted by one. It was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than fear, more than ordinary terror of something tan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gible. I had not believed in the things; I had not ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted--even to myself--that they actually existed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had not for a moment expected Sir Esme to succeed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his quest. And now, though it outraged common sense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though my mind could not fully grasp the actuality, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible had occurred and we were in the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mysterious, invisible phenomenon. I felt, I knew, tliat</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything depended upon the smoke-screen and yet I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not feel sure that it could be relied upon. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all guesswork, all experiment, and I mentally cursed my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self for being such a fool to have taken part in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hare-brained, mad undertaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL this flashed through my consciousness in an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant. The next moment I had leaped up and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashing headlong' through the twilight obscurity towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir Esme's laboratory. But I checked myself in time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even in my excitement I realized that to burst in upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, to interrupt him at his work might result in disaster.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet I was mad, filled with an overpowering desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn the truth, to know what was taking place. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">long I stood there white-faced, trembling, striving to</seg><seg type="columnLine">force myself to be calm, I cannot say. It seemed hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet it could not have been more than minutes. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to my senses by a burst of sunlight, by seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pall of smoke vanish, and the next moment Sir Esme</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. Never had I seen him so excited, so keyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. Yet his face was radiant, his eyes fairly sparkled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triumph was in his voice as he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Congratulate me!" he cried. "I was right! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">areas exist! And the smoke counteracts them, destroys</seg><seg type="columnLine">them! Did-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God!" I exclaimcd fervently. "But-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything worked out exactly as I had surmised, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had deduced," he continued, heedless of my interrup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. "Did you feel the shock--the lift of the ship?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was marvelous! According to my instruments the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire vessel was lifted--drawn up nearly two inches before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoke-screen became efficient. Think of it, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend! And yet is was a comparatively small area and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were not at the exact apex. And"--with a note of</seg><seg type="columnLine">218</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">real regret in his tones--"it was completely dissipated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the smoke. What a pity! How can I study the phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomena if I am forced to avoid disaster by using smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when, by using smoke, I destroy the phenomena ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damned if I know!" T ejaculated. "But thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heaven tlie confounded thing zvas destroyed. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad enough as it was. And if that was a weak area, may</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlie Lord keep us away from a strong one. And yet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet now it is over, I can't really believe it. I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Relieve it or not, it's a fact," he assured me. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">best of all It proves I was right about the localities where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the areas exist. Do you know we are in almost the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precise spot where T tentatively placed the Marie Celeste</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the time her company vanished ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gasped. The calm manner in which he made the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncement was simply amazing, and, unconsciously, T</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast anxious, half-terrified glances at tlie sparkling sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if expecting to see some visible manifestations of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomenon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For heaven's sake, let's get away from here," I cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You've proved your case, you've learned how to coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teract the effects of the uncanny tilings. What more do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed. "I've only begun," he declared. "I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn if this was mere chance, if there are others, if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are constant, and I must investigate conditions in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">localities--in the. vicinity of rhe spot where the Koben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">havn was last reported, in that area where so many air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes have vanished. I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here," I interrupted. "You're taking a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk, Sir Esme. Suppose you ran-across one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things at night, or when you were not prepared to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the smoke-screen. Why, before you could say 'Boo!'</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would all be done for forever. Tt's deucedly hard for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to believe the things exist and yet I'm convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's something out here, some uncanny, mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">business going on. And I admit I don't like the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkeying with it. And how about your crew--what</seg><seg type="columnLine">do they think of this matter? Sailors are usually a</seg><seg type="columnLine">superstitious lot. Aren't they scared?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should they be?" he countered. "Captain Is-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bister lias perfect confidence in me, and I warned him</seg><seg type="columnLine">before starting that we might experience some rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbing occurrences. But of course I have not at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to explain what they really are. He and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew imagine it all a matter of scientific experiments--</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorological, in fact--and to their minds the slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">jar they felt was produced by me. Besides"--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled at the idea--"they have confidence in me. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt they argue that I must value my life and safety,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so there can be no danger. And anyway, they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">all Scots and--1 can say it without undue egotism--old</seg><seg type="columnLine">retainers who regard their laird as little less than divine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'd follow me into Hell without a question."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is 110 use in repeating all the conversation, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arguments I employed in my endeavor to induce Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esme to abandon his, to my mind, mad and suicidal</seg><seg type="columnLine">intentions. He was obsessed with the idea, his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience--which I hoped and prayed was mere chance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and would never be repeated-had merely whetted his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">desire for more, and when he finally lost his patience and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarcastically offered to set me ashore if I feared to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, I retorted that if he imagined I possessed less courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he, Harvey or his Scotch seamen, he was vastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken, and if he was bound to commit suicide and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose his ship or be whisked off into space by tempting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fate and fooling with things he didn't know anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, he'd find me making an ass of myself along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Then, suddenly realizing that we'd both lost our</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempers and had acted childishly, we grinned, had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink, told each other we were damned fools, and, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">moie as friendly and agreeable as ever continued on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether Sir Esme's calculations and deductions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at fault, whether the areas were 110-existent, whether by</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance we missed them, I cannot say, but days passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and despite his constant application, his constant ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servations and tests, Sir Esme was unable to locate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second Esmeismic disturbance. We cruised back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth, sailed in wide circles, drifted idly over a glassy sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed and repassed the localities where, according to Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esme's deductions, the phenomena should be most nu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merous, but there was 110 trace of them. It began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look as if our first experience was to be the only one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I am sure that Sir Esme himself was becoming dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couraged and I could not blame him. He had made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, a monumental discovery; he had evolved an elab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orate, an amazing hypothesis; lie had devoted years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">research and a fortune to his efforts, and now', after all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his preparations, his hopes and his optimistic expecta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, he had found only one of the strange Esmeismic</seg><seg type="columnLine">areas and had been unable to study it or to learn any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of value in regard to it. No, I should not say that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for as I told him, I felt that he had learned the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable and important fact of all, namely that the dread</seg><seg type="columnLine">things could be nullified, rendered perfectly harmless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He smiled when I called his attention to this fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Quite true, to a certain extent," he agreed, "but abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely valueless. You forget that, in order to make use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoke-screen, one must know when and where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomenon is about to occur. I, being constantly 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch and equipped with the most delicate of devices</seg><seg type="columnLine">for detecting its presence, was thus enabled to use the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke to advantage. But you will recall that, even so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came very near complete failure. What chance then</seg><seg type="columnLine">would a ship or an airplane have? By tlie time tlie area</seg><seg type="columnLine">was detected it would be too late to nullify it. No ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">has ever had time to send an SOS before being over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed, much less an opportunity of producing a screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had to admit he was right. As matters stood his</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery did not amount to anything as a safeguard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sir Esme possessed the proverbial British stick-to-it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iveness and it began to look as if the cruise might con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue forever and the Lock Lovcrn might become a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond Flying Dutchman. We were in the doldrums at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time, and for day after day the ocean stretched as</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth as a sheet of burnished silver under a cloudless</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. It was beastly hot; time began to hang rather heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily on my hands, and I had become firmly convinced--</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my own mind--that the supposed area of Esmeism</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had met had been nothing but an atmospheric dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbance and that the things did not actually exist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I had, in fact, returned to my original point of view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought what a superstitious fool I had been to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been terrified by an imaginary danger that unquestion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably existed only in my friend's mind, and I was dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick and tired of the whole fruitless search. I tried fish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I dipped up buckets of the floating sargassum and</seg><seg type="columnLine">amused myself examining the strange crabs, fish and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other marine creatures that inhabited it, and I searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizon until my eyes ached, hoping vainly for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NON-GRAVITATIONAL VORTEX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">219</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of a distant sail or smudge of smoke to tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were not the only ship afloat upon that vast, limitless</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanse of sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was while thus sweeping the horizon with my glasses</seg><seg type="columnLine">one morning that I descried a low dark object break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the sea's rim. For a moment I thought it a whale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I dccided it was a floating log. Yet it did nor ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear exactly like a water-logged tree and, my curiosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused, I hurried aloft for a better view. Then as 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">focussed my glasses upon the tiling, I discovered it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">derelict, the almost submerged hull of some wrecked ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almost at the same instant the captain discovered it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">verified my observations. There is always something</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragic, something exciting about sighting a derelict and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon all aboard the Loch Lovern, who were not otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged, had gathered on deck, their eyes flxed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distant wreck; Slowly wc moved towards it: each</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute it became nearer, clearer, and a couple of hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">after I had first caught sight of the tiling it was in plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">view: the hull of a wooden vessel, with the jagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumps of masts projecting above the decks that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost awash, with shattered, splintered bulwarks, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather-beaten, so overgrown with seaweed that showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">each time the bulk rose or fell 10 the long, almost in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible swell, that it obviously had been floating about</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something, some whim tempted me to visit fee wreck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sir Esme ordered a boat lowered and manned, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he declined to join me, declaring that if he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted his instruments it would be just like his luck to</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss detecting the presence of one of his confounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">areas, "Well, if one comes along, shunt it off from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">derelict," I laughed as I jumped into the waiting boat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You see, we haven't any smoke-screen devices on her."</seg><seg type="columnLine">As we pulled away I saw Sir Esme turn and enter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory where Harvey had remained on duty, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">regretted having spoken so flippantly, for he looked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit hurt and I knew how mortified he felt at the failure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his plans. But a moment later the boat was along-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the hulk and with some difficulty, for everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">was covered with slime and I dared not trust to the dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling remnants of rolled cordage, I managed to scramble</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the deck. There really was nothing much to see. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">decks, where not washed by the water, were white with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the droppings of sea birds. The deck houses were</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed in as if by falling spars, and a glance within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remains of the cabin revealed only black, ill-smelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. But the hatches were still in place and I sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mised that it must be the air within the hold that kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wreck afloat. Now that I was upon the derelict all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lure of the unknown, all the fascination of the ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">waif was lost, and I was on the point of calling to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to bring the. boat alongside when one of them called</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that a portion of the wreck's name was still legible</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you make it out?" I asked, peering over the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains of the after-rail. "We ought to report her if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can find out what she is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pretty well weathered, sir," he answered, "and only</seg><seg type="columnLine">shows when she rolls a bit to sta'ho'd. Looks to me like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foreign name, sir. Yes, sir, that's what 'tis. Dago o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort, sir.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a peculiar gurgling, moaning sound from behind me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Startled, fearing that the wreck was about to sink be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath me, I' whirled, tense, ready to leap into the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swim for my life. As I did so, there was a sharp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrified shout from the men: "Gawd, the Loch Lovern!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I had already seen. Never will I forget what my</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrified eyes saw. I seemed frozen, glued to the spot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzed. From beneath the yacht's keel a great column</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water rose up. A foaming, whirling, roaring geyser.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And upon its summit---rocking, pitching, spinning like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">teetotum was the Loch Lovern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was so terrible, so unreal, sq uncanny, I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe my senses. I seemed in a nightmare, a ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream. And it seemed all the more dreamlike, all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more incredible and unreal because on every side the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea stretched calm, unruffled by the faintest breeze, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead the brilliant sun blazed down from a flawless</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky of blue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Up and up, faster and yet faster, rose the yacht, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">below her the water boiled and roared like an inverted</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirlpool. And then, between her keel and the. rnael-</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm below, my incredulous eyes saw vacant space. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loch Lovern was floating in air! She was poised, gyrat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing madly, fully fifty feet above the sea, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbing shock realization came to me. She was caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one of the Esmeismic vortices, she was being lifted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">projected into space!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It had all happened in an instant--perhaps in the frac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of a second--yet to me it seemed minutes, hours, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gazed, almost bereft of my senses, at the yacht being</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted bodily into the air by that unseen terrible force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly yacht, sky, that fearful ominous cone</seg><seg type="columnLine">of swirling sea, seemed blotted out. Where a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they had been was a dense black cloud. Then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our cars came the sounding of a rending crash. Waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">came rushing towards us from the writhing, rolling cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of black. The derelict rocked sluggishly, the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilchcd and tossed, water hissed across the decks about</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet. I gasped, caught my breath, seemed choking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I watched, still incapable of movement, striving to</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrate that pall of blackness where the Loch Lovern</seg><seg type="columnLine">had vanished. Yet my mind was working, my brain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">functioning. I knew what had happened. Sir Esme had</seg><seg type="columnLine">released his smoke-screen. The gravitation had been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stored, the yacht had fallen back into the sea. But too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late. The yacht crashing back from such a height must</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been shattered, battered, and Sir Esme, Harvey and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others must have been killed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly the smoke thinned, drifting away. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse shout I came to life, leaped into the boat, shouted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore at the men to bend to their oars.

We were afloat in a small boat in mid-Atlantic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">burdened with two unconscious men, hundreds of miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the nearest land, far out of the track of ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and our only food and water were the meagre supplies</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which the small boats were always provided. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was so busy striving to restore Sir Esme and Harvey</seg><seg type="columnLine">to consciousness that I scarcely realized the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the quartermaster in charge of the boat's crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beggin' your pardon, sir," he said, "we're in a rum</seg><seg type="columnLine">fix, what with the bile o' biscut an' the keg o' water</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard, sir. Maybe, sir, if 1 may be so bold as to sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gest it, sir, we'd best have a look about an' see can we</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick something from the wreckage, sir. And there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">that other stove boat, sir. Maybe the biscuit an' water</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her's all right, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, by all means," I agreed, "but be quick about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We must get Sir Esme and Harvey to the derelict. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">our only refuge for the present."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Luck was with us. Not only did we find the biscuit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and water in tlie wrecked boat still intact, but among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">debris we picked up a cask half full of water, a case of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine, a keg of ship's beef and an unopened box of cheese.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no danger of dying of thirst or starvation</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some time, and even as we rowed towards the dere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lict. I was forming vague plans for salvation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even the waterlogged derelict seemed welcome and</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe, in comparison to the cockle-shell of a boat, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having transferred Sir Esme and Ilarvey to the cleanest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and driest portion of tlie deck we devoted all our efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reviving them. Both men evidently had been stunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rendered unconscious before falling into the sea, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most fortunate thing, for they had drawn but little water</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Iheir lungs. Rubbing them, slapping them, rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on the decks, forcing the welcome and providential</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine down their throats, we worked at them. Harvey</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the first to regain consciousness. He opened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, took a deep breath, blinked and gazed about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What---what's happened?" he whispered. "Where am</seg><seg type="columnLine">I? Where's Captain Mendoza? And who are you? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't recognize you. How did you get here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, before I could reply, before I could recover</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my astonishment at his failure to recognize me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my dread that he had received a blow that had deranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, lie continued, "Of course! Now I remember. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Santa Incs was wrecked, struck by some sort of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cyclone. But I thought--I must have imagined it--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was blown, sucked from her. Rut of course you picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me up. Where are the others? Who is the poor chap</seg><seg type="columnLine">yonder?" He indicated Sir Esme.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was so amazed that for a moment I could not speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He remembered lie had been on the Santa foes. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory had returned. But how was it possible he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know Sir Esme; that he did not know me or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartermaster? Then, before I could frame a question,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir Esme drew a deep breath, sighed, and opening his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, sat up with a jerk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank Heaven you've recovered!" I exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the deuce has happened?" he ejaculated. "What</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the devil am I doing here ? Where's-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you remember?" I asked anxiously, a numb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing chill at my heart, for fear he had received some</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious injury to his brain. "The yacht was wrecked--</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled into the air by one of the vortices. But thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">God you used the smoke in time to save your life aud</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of Harvey. And you're on the derelict. T picked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you both up. It-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yacht! Wreck! Vortices!" he cried. "What die</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil arc you talking about? What do you mean by</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke? What derelict are you referring to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My worst fears, I felt, were borne' out. Sir Esme</seg><seg type="columnLine">was raving. He must be out of his head. But perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought, it was merely the effects of shock, a temporary</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss of memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It will all come back to you in a short time," I as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured him. "No wonder you cannot get your wits to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether or your memory working right away. It's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same with Harvey; he didn't recognize me at first. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">thank God we are all safe for the present, though poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isbister and the rest are lost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir Esme was frowning, his bushy brows knit, obvi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously striving to recall the details of the catastrophe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I remember being on the yacht," he said at last, speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing slowly and as if voicing each detail as it returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "And I recall that you were with me. and Harvey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course. But what the devil we were doing, what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, is all a blank. Sorry to hear old Isbister's gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I suppose we must have run into this hulk, eh? Funny</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, that; he was a good seaman. Must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the night, I presume. But I can't grasp what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant by the Loch Lovcrn being hurled into the air by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some devilish thing you call a vortex, unless you mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were hit by a water-spout. But what's to be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">next? Can't stop here on a half-sunken wreck for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head. Sir Esme spoke rationally, sanely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but evidently he could not recall the tragedy. And if--</seg><seg type="columnLine">my thoughts were interrupted by Harvey who, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently regained nearly his normal strength, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting up, staring with a puzzled expression at Sir Esme</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pardon me, but are you Sir Esme McDonald?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir Esme wheeled. "What ?" he exclaimed. "By Gad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are we all crazy? Of course I am. I might just as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask you if you're Harvey."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'm not," was the amazing reply. "Who's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harvey? I never heard of him. I'm Professor Arch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ibald Ilumiston of Langford. I recognized you from</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures I've seeii and I am interested and glad to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you on account of your excellent article in the Sports-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man on the preservation of wild game. I'm intensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in the subject. But what, may I ask, brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">you here, Sir Esme? I was not aware that there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel in sight when the Santa Ines ran into that terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirlwind. And now here you are with these other</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NON-GRAVITATIONAL VORTEX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">221</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers aboard; all that's left of the poor old Santa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if you wish to know what I was doing on a Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, I was returning from the Canaries, where my yacht</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone on the rocks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir Esme's jaw gaped; he was gazing at the man we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known as Harvey as though he had been a ghost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I, too, was staring at him, speechless with astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. The fellow's lost memory had been miraculously</seg><seg type="columnLine">restored. He remembered who he was, where he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been when disaster overtook him, but--judging from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words--lie could recall nothing that had occurred subse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent to the loss of the Santa Ines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir Esme was the first to speak. "By Jove!" he cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"either you're as crazy as a mad hatter or I am. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be Professor Humiston--T'll admit you might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the King of Dahomey or the President of Argentina, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I know to the contrary. But to me you're Harvey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chap I picked up drifting, damn near drowned, off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the West Indies.

Hang it all, you may be Sir Esme Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donald, Baronet, but you're stark, staring mad if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say such tilings. Why, good Lord, man, here I am, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet from my immersion, still 011 all that's left of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Santa Ines, and you have the monumental nerve to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that you picked me up a thousand miles from here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen, please, please wait a bit," I begged them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I saw Sir Esme's face flushing with anger. "Let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to explain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In as few words as possible I tried to make them</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand. But it was hopeless to try to awaken their</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories. Harvey--no, Professor Humiston had, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some freak of mind, perhaps through shock, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">through some strange, mysterious effect of the Esme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ismic area, been restored to full and complete memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his life up to the time when the Santa Ines had met</seg><seg type="columnLine">with disaster, which, I was now firmly convinced, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been caused by a non-gravitational vortex exactly as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loch Lovern had been wrecked. Rut all subsequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">events, his rescue, his service with Sir Esme, his life as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mysterious Ilarvey, had all been wiped completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other hand. Sir Esme, through the same shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the same effects of the force that had destroyed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht, had lost all memory of the events leading up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disaster, and as I soon discovered he had not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintest recollection of having discovered Esmeism, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">having set out 011 a voyage to locate the Esmeismic areas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More, and most amazing of all, he did not remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything whatsoever about his scientific work. Science,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific terms conveyed 110 meaning to him. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">less of science or at least no more 011 the subject than did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hobson, the quartermaster. All the months, the years</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had devoted to scientific work were a blank to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His other personality, Alexander Macdonald, had ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to exist even as a memory, and only Sir Esme remained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INDEED, both he and Professor Humiston scoffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">openly at my attempts to convince them of the truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They both regarded me as having become mentally de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged from my experiences, and each looked upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other as a bit mad and regarded himself as the only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">really sane member of our shipwrecked party. Never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless they became good friends ;md presently ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">arguing and turned their attention to the more pressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and important matter of evolving some means of rescu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ourselves from our precarious position. Very prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably we might all have succumbed to thirst, starvation</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other causes had it not been for Hobson, who remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered the yacht's position when he had last been at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel. And being an unusually observant fellow for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">common sailor, and with ambitions to become a navi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gator, he had noticed that the chart showed a group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small islands about two to three degrees south and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree and a half west of our position. To attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">traverse nearly two hundred miles of ocean in a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, whose only means of propulsion was oars, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat dangerous undertaking, not to mention the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardships it would entail. But with a seaworthy, well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">built boat and in the calmest portion of the ocean, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a far less hazardous matter than to remain upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting derelict, that might never be sighted by a pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ship. Moreover, we had no choice in the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That same night a long, slow swell came rolling out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the east, the waterlogged hulk rose and fell sluggishly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">water washed over its all but submerged dccks, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn burst in a blaze of glory over the vast expanse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea, we found that the derelict's hours were numbered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the night she had settled appreciably. At an)'</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the hatches might give way and she would then</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge like a plummet to the bottom of the ocean. So,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having breakfasted 011 crackers, cheese, and wine, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambered into the small boat and pushed off from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathetic hulk that, within the next few hours, would van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And we were not a moment too soon. Scarcely were</seg><seg type="columnLine">we clear of the wreck when there was a rending, tearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion; fragments of timbers and hatch covers flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">high in air, water poured in torrents over the rent decks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into the yawning hold, and suddenly lifting her stem</seg><seg type="columnLine">in air she plunged beneath the waves. But in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment that her battered counter had been raised clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea, her name, painted amid ornate scrolls across</seg><seg type="columnLine">her stern, had been reveiUed, and with incredulous eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had read: "Santa Ines, Barcelona"! It seemed im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, incredible, utterly beyond belief. Harvey--no,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Humiston--had been right!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By some freak of fate he, we, had found refuge upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hulk of the ship from which he had been cast into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea. Of course he didn't appear in the least surprised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he was utterly unaware that nearly two years had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed since the Santa Ines had .been left, a battered, hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less wreck, by the phenomenon that had destroyed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had carried him--yes, I was forced to believe it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of miles across the ocean. The Lord only</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows what the effect might have been had Sir Esme</seg><seg type="columnLine">read the derelict's name, but fortunately his head was</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned at the time and it escaped him. But as he recalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of his theories and merely knew he had rescued</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Humiston from the sea 111 a distant part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean, in all probability the revelation of the derelict's</seg><seg type="columnLine">name would merely have confirmed his belief in Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vey's--110, the Professor's--mental delusions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There is little more to tell. In due time we reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the islands, little the worse for our long, hazardous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncomfortable voyage.

Each lens shall take up the vibration of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">element. Good. I place in the sending chamber, let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, the box of candy which you wish to send to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetheart, and turn on the current. Each element is</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken up by its own lens on the screen, and passes into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the condensing globe, where all arc focused into one ray.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This ray shall fall upon a reversing screen at the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiving station, and all parts shall be reassembled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same form as before.

I turn it until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little needle on the dial shall point to the London mark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If it is not point correctly the switch will not close.

From</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">iron he turned to other elements, and then to simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">compounds, advancing rapidly to those which were more</seg><seg type="columnLine">complex. He was wild with delight when he succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sending a block of wood across the room, proving that</seg><seg type="columnLine">so-called organic matter was not beyond the power nf his</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine to handle. Then came the wonderful day when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he succeeded in sending a dead cat across the laboratory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Having accomplished this, he was ready for the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">step in the development of the invention: the step from</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead and inert materials to the living creature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After several days of careful adjustment of the appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus, he believed that everything was in shape; and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted upon my being present at this crucial test. A living</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat was placed in the sending chamber, and the current</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on. I confess that I felt much like a schoolboy</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking a piece and suffering from stage fright. Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ilofen's hand trembled so that he could hardly close the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch. Unfortunately for the cat, the experiment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a complete success; the instrument being evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">in need of further adjustment. The animal arrived at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the receiving screen in apparently excellent shape, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept that it was dead. During the next week the mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tality rate among the cats in the neighborhood rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmingly; but, just seven days after the first experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, the cat, a big Maltese, as I remember, was found</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the receiving end contentedly purring, and apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaware that anything unusual had happened to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next step was to rent a room in a shabby building</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the neighborhood called "Hell's Kitchen." This place</seg><seg type="columnLine">had formerly been occupied as a gambling den. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined with sheet iron; its heavy door was also rein-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced with iron, and defended by huge locks. Here we</seg><seg type="columnLine">installed an immensie receiving screen, and experimented</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sending various objects across the city. This un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">savory neighborhood was chosen for the double reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was a desirable distance from the sending station</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was, moreover, in a section where strange actions</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unlikely to attract much .attention from anyone ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept, possibly, the police. The fortified room, moreover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendered it less likely that inquisitive persons would</seg><seg type="columnLine">force their way into the place, with consequent damage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to delicate apparatus costing many thousands of dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">to install.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The culmination of this series of experiments brought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">incidentally, one of the greatest sensations which the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known for a long time. By means of bank note di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plomacy, securing the connivance of the janitor of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain medical school, we arranged to borrow a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">man from the pickling vat, pledging ourselves to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn the same when we had done with it. That was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly piece of work. Approaching the building at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear entrance, and giving a preconcerted signal, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted by our dusky co-conspirator of the dissecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, where he was engaged at the time of our arrival,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pleasant task of gathering up such fragments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human remains as were no longer of use, to be burned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an incinerator in the basement. All about, stretched 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">slabs, were awful shapes that made my flesh creep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some were covered, some were not; some, were entire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some decidedly not. I fell like a ghoul. From the vat</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the rear of this cheerful place a prospective subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fished, with the assistance of the janitor, bundled up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and conveyed to the car waiting by the door, taking ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of the time between the rounds of the police-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man on the beat. With our unpleasant passenger we</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped to the basement laboratory on Second Avenue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smuggled it in, and placed it in the sending chamber of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ELEMENT 87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">225</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the full-sized machine which had now taken the place oE</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little working model of a few months before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole experience was so weird, so smacking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">witchcraft, sorcery and that sort of thing, that to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">day I get goose flesh when I think about it. We placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead man in the chair, securing him in a sitting posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion by means of bits of insulated wire that lay scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the place. I can see him now, that grisly dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, sitting in that chair, surrounded by tubes, coils</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all sorts of mysterious apparatus. His sunken eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were open, staring. Von Hofen seemed, if possible, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more nervous than I. 1 remember that when either of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke, which was not often, it was in a whisper, or in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such low tones, as one might use in addressing a fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">mourner at a funeral. New and powerful induction coils</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been provided, and current at a high voltage had</seg><seg type="columnLine">displaced the 110 volts of former experiments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yon Hofen went over the entire machine; tightening</seg><seg type="columnLine">a binding screw here, adjusting something there. I feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty ccrtain that all this was more, for the purpose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">delaying the crucial moment until he could get control</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his nerves, than for any other reason. All was ready.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In dead silence von Hofen threw the switch. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus quivered as the current roared between anode</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cathode; the room was flooded with ghastly blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and the air was heavy with the smell of ozone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While von Ho fen's hand was still clutching the switch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sending chamber was empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Von Hofen jerked open the switch, and we rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the room to the street, never stopping to turn out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light, and slamming doors behind us as we went. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the clang of the iron gate as I reached the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the area steps. W'e leaped into the waiting car and sped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in defiance of the traffic laws, I fear, to the house on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tenth Avenue. Up the stairway we raced, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police were after us. Von Hofen's hands shook so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could hardly get the key into the lock. W'e</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung the door open and snapped on the light. A horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight met our eyes. The body was there; but in a condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion which it would be idle even to attempt to describe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Scrambled" is the only word that I can think of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">can even faintly suggest it. The features were grotesque-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly misplaced, as were the arms and legs; but this was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the. worst. The. entire structure had been shifted, so to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak. I have no doubt that a microscopic examination</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have shown that not a cell of the entire organism</seg><seg type="columnLine">had retained its proper shape and position. The result</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something which had certainly never been seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">before in the history of the world. I cannot even hint</seg><seg type="columnLine">at its appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we had promised to return the body to the pickling</seg><seg type="columnLine">vat, there was nothing to do but to bundle up the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smuggle it back to the medical school, get it into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vat without anyone having seen it, and leave future</seg><seg type="columnLine">events to take care of themselves. We managed to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complish this without permitting our janitor friend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at the gruesome object; when, therefore, it should</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn up in the dissecting room, there would be nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to connect it with the subject \ve had borrowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few days later the creature was fished from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vat and placed upon a slab, and then the fireworks began.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The medicos declared that it was utterly impossible that</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a being could have survived to reach maturity, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there it was, to'be accounted for. No one knew whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had come, and every effort to trace it back to its source,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so to speak, resulted in failure. The morgue emphatically</seg><seg type="columnLine">denied all knowledge of it. A storm of discussion arose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Physicians and surgeons from all parts oi the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">flocked to inspect it, and add their conjectures to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of conflicting opinion. A noted chemist offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suggestion that the astounding condition observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been caused, in some manner, by the liquid in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pickling vat, but, as the other subjects in the vat showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no signs of distortion, this theory was not generally</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The newspapers devoted their front pages to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morbid details. One Sunday Edition contained a whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">page of pseudo-scientific hokum, with blood-curdling il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lustrations, gravely discussing the probability oi the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture's having come on a meteorite or from Mars. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a millionaire eloped with his stenographer, the front page</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the public turned their attention to that, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incident was forgotten; exccpt by a few medical men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, no doubt, are still puzzling over it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time in all my acquaintance with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found von Hofen dejected and discouraged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can do no more," said he. "The screen must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">radioactive. I have used radium; but it is--how shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">I express it? too coarse. There is no known element that</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take its place. There is one, number eighty-seven in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scale. It comes next to radium in the periodic table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That, I am sure, would do ; but it has never been dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered. There is only one man in all the world whom I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could depend upon to find it for us. He is the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all chemists. Fame, wealth, what you will, might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">his; but he has the evil heart. He. is even now in prison."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Prison doors can be opened," I said. "I will stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">short of nothing but murder to put this thing across.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who is he? Where is he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was, it seemed, one Professor John Carson, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">residence at the time was one of those neat and compact</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, apartments up in Ossining prison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I am a normally law-abiding citizen; but, in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance, it appeared to me that the success of von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hofen's invention was of such immense importance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind as to justify a ccrtain waiving of legal techni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">calities, as long as nobody was actually harmed thereby,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if such should be necessary. Here was evidently a case</seg><seg type="columnLine">where bank-note diplomacy was again called for. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">such diplomatic means, therefore, I secured the coopera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of a turnkey or two. When that had been accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished, the rest was comparatively easy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I HAD a long interview with Professor Carson, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I made certain propositions to him, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted with alacrity. At the same time T took careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">note of his personal appearance, manner of speech, size</seg><seg type="columnLine">and approximate weight, as they appeared to me from</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal observation. I also sccurcd exact data on these</seg><seg type="columnLine">points, together with a photograph, from the prison files.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next thing was to find a man answering as closely as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to the general description of Carson, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">financial status was such as to render it worth his while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do two years' "time" for a few thousand dollars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This required a little, delay, but the man was finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This man was admitted to Carson's cell, where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">exchanged clothing. At the end of the call, Carson</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked out, unsuspected, leaving his visitor to serve, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance of his term. Carson was given clearly to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand that his freedom was only to last as long as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">played square with us; and that, at the first sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked work, means would be found for getting him</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more behind the bars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">22 0</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  These little details having been attended to, a fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped laboratory was provided for the use of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemist, at my expense. As I watched him at work, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">full rather proud to be the owner of all that collection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnaces, beakers, retorts and crooked glassware; even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I had no remotest notion what any of it was for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the matter of zeal, Carson left nothing to be desired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was in his element, seemingly fascinated by his task;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he threw himself heart and soul into his work, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he loved better than anything else on earth--except</seg><seg type="columnLine">crime. On one occasion, at least, he remained for a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-four hours in the laboratory, fascinated by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment which he was conducting, never leaving it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat or sleep. And then, one day, he came into the base-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment room on Second Avenue, with a beaker containing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a handful of something that resembled coal ashes more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than anything else I can think of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Here," said he, "is a concentrate containing the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, we are looking for. From its position in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Periodic Table, I was convinced that it would be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one of the radioactive ores, accompanied by, and prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably overshadowed, by radium. Yesterday I found un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistakable traces of it; and by working all last night I</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally obtained this. I could, no doubt, separate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">element in my laboratory; but, with the aid of von Hofen</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, I think we can save considerable time. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner over there is a small model of the projector,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, I understand, has but one lens, as von Hofen</seg><seg type="columnLine">calls it, tuned for iron. If von Hofen will provide us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a small lens tuned for the purpose, we can separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the element we desire more quickly, and probably in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a purer state than I could obtain it in my laboratory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few hours the desired screen was at hand. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrate was placed in the sending chamber of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little projector, and the small receiving screen was set up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its old place at the end of the room. When the switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">was closed, I could observe no difference in the appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of the concentrate; but, on the little tray before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiving screen, was scattered a greyish powder. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps a teaspoon ful altogether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't touch it," warned Carson. "It is not as de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structive as radium, I am certain; but I shouldn't care</seg><seg type="columnLine">to handle it with bare hands until we know more about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it." He poured the powder into a small leaden phial,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he held out toward us with a dramatic gesture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here it is," he said, "Element Number 87, discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered by me, John Carson, and which I have taken the</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberty of naming after myself, 'Carsonium'; and here"</seg><seg type="columnLine">--producing a small note-book--"is the formula."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Carsonium," to our great delight, proved to be all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had hoped for.

Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">von Ilofen opened the book and began to mumble over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the figures which it contained.

Let us search,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps the real formula is concealed here." I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it most unlikely; nevertheless we ransacked the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly, even examining the contents of a waste bas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ket, which stood by the desk. It is hardly necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that we found nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day was breaking when, at last, we returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Second Avenue basement, where we sat down for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">council of war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Von Hofen," I said, "you can bet your last dollar</seg><seg type="columnLine">that that formula is resting, safe aud sound, in Carson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket.

You amuse me. The formula is</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine and the machine is mine. Last night, while you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were busy in my laboratory, I was busy in yours. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a careful study of all plans, blueprints and data</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding this most ingenious invention; and I think I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am now as familiar with its details as von Hofen himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, to guard against any possible failure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory on my part, I took possession of all said plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and data, and have them now in my coat pocket.

He was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased with his cleverness, and so much amused</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the little lecture he was giving us that he became a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">careless. I seized the opportunity, and sprang upon him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking at the hand which held the revolver. He fired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the ball buried itself harmlessly in the ceiling. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same instant von Hofen leaped to my assistance. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ELEMENT 87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">227</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was amazed at the strength that seemed to be in the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow's lean frame, and I myself am no wealding; hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carson was like a thing of steel springs and wire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The revolver was knocked to the floor, and the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us staggered about the room, fighting like demons. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not the slightest doubt but that Carson could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed the two of us, but, in the struggle, he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the fallen revolver, which slipjpbd along the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing him off his balance. He fell violently against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the projector, his head striking the heavy iron frame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment he was partially stunned. That moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was enough. Before he could recover himself, we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">him down. I tied his wrists and ankles with some pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heavy copper wire which lay upon the. floor, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">buuud him securely to the chair in the sending chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the projector. Von Ilofen threw the switch. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">current roared, the blue light flared, and he was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," said von Hofen, "we must get an officer. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in the room on Tenth Avenue, bound hand and foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We must get the formula from him, and then-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then," I finished, "we will get him back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison by the same means that got him out.

"Let us go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sadly we returned to the basement room, where stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">the now useless transmitter--useless because we had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed the last of our Carsonium in getting rid of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">discoverer; and we could produce no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My friend," said von Hofen, "we are dead men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">How we escaped from that room I cannot guess; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has made similar escapes before.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">only glanced at the metal, still too hot to touch, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about the room. The bonds had been taken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now they noticed that over the mail-clerk's desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been fastened a small envelope.

As they were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one by one put into the large electric blankets, and each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">given the correct dose of the salt, the men waited anx-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">iously for results--and within ten minutes of the injec-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion the first had regained consciousness 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">PIRACY PREFERRED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">231</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The work went forward steadily and successfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every one of the passengers and crew was revived. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pirate had spoken the truth. The woman who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been suffering from cancer, was free from pain for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time in many months. She was cured!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The papers were issuing extras within five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the time the great plane was landed, and the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">news service was broadcasting the first "break" in a par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly dead month. All this June the news had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead, and now it looked as though the month of Sol</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to begin with a bang! And now with time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think and investigate, the airport officials went over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship with the Air Guard, using a fine-tooth comb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was soon evident that the job had been done from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside, as the Pirate had said it was. The emergency</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot testified that when he entered, he found a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">piecc of wire securing the air lode from the outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This had certainly been put on while the ship was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight, and that meant that whoever had done this, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed on the great ship with a small plane, anchored it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some way, then entered the plane through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock at the ten-mile height. That required that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should wear a suit to protect him both from the intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold and from the low pressure. He had probably flown</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the path of the plane with his plane, leaving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail of the gas in its way to be drawn in through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventilator pumps. It had been washed out by the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming good air later, for the officials had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected; nor had the emergency pilot been acted on when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the investigation led them to the mail-room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door had been opened by melting or burning out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock. The heat of the combustion of the magnesium</seg><seg type="columnLine">was enough for that, but the berylium and special anti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">combustion catalyst made this very difficult. But now</seg><seg type="columnLine">they realized the truly amazing fact: the safe had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened by melting it through. There was practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">no oxidation of the cut itself, but the metal near by,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been incandescent no doubt, was coated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thin layer of tungsten oxide. The iridium content</seg><seg type="columnLine">really prevented oxidation, and with a melting point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">3500 degrees centigrade it meant that the Pirate must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have an entirely new torch. This would be as great</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boon to the metallurgical industries as the cancer curc</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be to the medical. It had been impossible to weld</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valuable tungsten alloys they had prepared, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were useless. If they could only be worked, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to stand high temperatures would make them</seg><seg type="columnLine">invaluable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bond shipment was due the next day, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">they svould lie on the watch for it. It would get through</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely, for men were put on board in steel tanks hermeti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally welded behind them, with oxygen tanks sealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">within to supply them with clean air. Automatic ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus was arranged to keep them supplied with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">correct amount of oxygen without effort on their part.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The waste gases were collected by alkali, a small elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trically driven pump taking care that the flow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained. The front of the tank was equipped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bullet-proof glass window, arid by means of electrically</seg><seg type="columnLine">operated controls the man inside could control a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine-gun. Thus he was perfectly protected from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pirate's gas and able to use his gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship was accompanied by a patrol of Air Guards-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Yet, several cancer cases were going with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope of being gassed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed that the Pirate's "patients" were due to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointed, ihough, for he certainly could not attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the plane was under the protection of a patrol of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Air Guardsmen; besides which, the men inside were</seg><seg type="columnLine">protected by the steel tanks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the plane readied the neighborhood of San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco the Air Guardsmen were disappointed, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been no sign of an attack on the plane. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pirate might well retire permanently on a million, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were alone, as the singular signature would indicate;</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut it seemed doubtful and it was much more probable</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would attempt another attack in any case. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that just meant watching all the planes from now on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was a tremendous job for the Air Guard to handle!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a vast network of plane lines! The leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the patrol turned in an easy bank to descend the ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles to earth, and his planes followed him. Then out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the corner of his eye he saw a flash of red and</seg><seg type="columnLine">while on the silvery surface of the giant plane. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plane was Giving the Automatic Signal fok an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emergency Pilot ! That could only mean that the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been gassed under the very eyes of his men!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bonds were gone and the passengers gassed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible as it was, the men aboard in the steel tanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were as thoroughly gassed as the rest! The note was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief, but as much to the point as was the absence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      To the Officials of the Airport</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Restore as usual.

The. bine curls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke from their pipes rose slowly, to be drawn away</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the efficient ventilating system. The taller of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two seemed to be doing most of the talking. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">positions they had assumed it would have been rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult to be sure of which was the taller, but William</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morey was a good four inches taller than Richard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arcot. Arcot had to suffer under the stigma of "runt"</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Morey around--he was only six feet tall. But die</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen occupation of each was physical research, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that Arcot could well have called Morey "runt," for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arcot had only one competitor in that field--namely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father. In this case it had been "like father, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">son." For many years Robert Arcot had been known</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the greatest American physicist, and probably the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's greatest. More recently he had been known as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the father of the world's greatest physicist. Arcot junior</seg><seg type="columnLine">was probably one of the most brilliant men the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever seen, and he was aided in all his work by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who could help him in a way that amplified his</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers a thousand fold. His father and his best friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morey, were the complementary and balancing minds to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his great intelligence. His father had learned through</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of work the easiest and best ways of performing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the many difficult feats of laboratory experimentation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morey had a mind that could develop the mathematical</seg><seg type="columnLine">232</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">theory of a hypothesis far more readily than Arcot</seg><seg type="columnLine">could. Morey had a mind more methodical and exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Arcot, hut Arcot had a mind that could grasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broad details of a problem and get the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of solution developed with a speed that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it utterly impossible for his friend to even follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps he suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since Arcot junior's invention of the multiple calculus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many new ramifications of the old theories had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">attained, and many developments had been possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the factor that made Arcot most successful in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his line of work was his ability to see practical uses</seg><seg type="columnLine">for things, an ability that is unfortunately lacking in so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many great physicists. Had he collected the royalties</seg><seg type="columnLine">his inventions merited, he would have been a billionaire</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice or thrice over. Instead he had made contracts</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the basis that the laboratories he owned be kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">in condition, and that he be paid a salary that should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be whatever he happened to need. Since he had sold</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his inventions to The Transcontinental Airways, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been able to devote all his time to science, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to manage his finances. Perhaps it was the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he did sell these inventions to the Transcontinental</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made these lines so successful, but at any rate Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent Arthur Morey was duly grateful, and when his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sou was able to enter the laboratories he was as de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted as Arcot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now these two were boon companions. They worked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">played, lived and thought together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just now they were talking about the Pirate. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the seventh day of his discovery, and he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing steadily more menacing. It was the great Trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">continental Airways that had suffered most repeatedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes it was the San Francisco Flyer that went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on without a pilot, sometimes the New York-St. Louis</seg><seg type="columnLine">expresses that would come over the field flying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-and-white flag of emergency. But always the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people were revived with little difficulty, and each time</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the stock of "Piracy, Inc." was accumulated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Air Guard seemed helpless. Time and again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pirate slipped in without their knowing it. Each time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he convinced them that it was an outside worker, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door was always sealed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dick, how do you suppose he gets away with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things he does right under the eyes of those Air Guards-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men? He must have some system; he does it every</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have a very vague idea. I was going to ask you</seg><seg type="columnLine">today, ii your father would let us take passage on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next liner carrying any money. I understand the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surance rates have been boosted so high that they don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare to send any cash by air any more. They have</seg><seg type="columnLine">resorted to the slow land routes. T guess they pay for it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, in the loss of interest, while the money is out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">circulation. Is there any money shipment in sight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, but I have something that is just as good, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">not better, for our purpose. The other day several</seg><seg type="columnLine">men came into Dad's office, to charter a plane to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to San Francisco, and Dad naturally wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">why it was they had been referred to the president of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the company. It seemed to him to be a job for a clerk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seems the difficulty was that these men wanted to hire</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship so they could be robbed! A large group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">medical men and cancer victims were going for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'treatments.' Each one of the twenty-five hundred go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was to bring along one hundred dollars. That meant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a total of a quarter of a million dollars, which is to be left</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the table. They hoped the Pirate would gas them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus cure them! Dad could not officially do this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but told them that if there were too many people for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the San Francisco express, two sections would be neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary. So I believe that they are going on that second</seg><seg type="columnLine">section. Only one hundred dollars! It seems a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheap cure for cancer at that!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another thing: Dad asked me to tell you that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would appreciate your help in stopping this ultra-modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirate. So if you go down and sec him in the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, you will doubtless be able to make the necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangements."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will do so gladly. I wonder, though, if you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">more about this than I do. Did they try that C-32L</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask on any animal?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Pirate was telling the truth. They tried it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dog and he went to sleep forever. But do you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">any idea how that gas does ail it does?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know what that gas is, but I can tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">some tilings that you may not know. Did you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instance, that carbon monoxide will seep through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid plate of red-hot steel? That has been known for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some three hundred years now, and I have to hand it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this Pirate for making use of it. Even in the war</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 2075 they didn't think .of it! He has just found</seg><seg type="columnLine">some gas that has these sleep-producing properties in</seg><seg type="columnLine">very low concentrations, and at the same time is able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to penetrate to an even greater extent than carbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">monoxide. It is just an amplification of known</seg><seg type="columnLine">properties."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was wondering how he stores that stuff. It re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds me of the old farmer and his smart son who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost discovered the Universal Solvent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Well son,' said the old farmer, 'I suppose it'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a durned good thing ta have, but what you going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep it in?' Similarly, if this gas leaks through every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, what are you going to keep iL in? I wonder if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he doesn't make it as fast as he uses it, by allowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two constituents to react? It might well be simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to store them separately, and the airstream blow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing past him would carry the gas behind him, so per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitting him to lay a stream of it in front of the. big plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is that about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was about what I had figured. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things I want to do when I go with that Invalid Special</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow is to get some samples for analyses."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whew, that's a pretty big order, isn't it, Dick?</seg><seg type="columnLine">How are you going to handle it, or even get it into your</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easily enough as far as getting the sample goes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have already had some sample bottles made. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them in the lab--excuse me a moment." Arcot</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the room, to return a few minutes later with a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">aluminum bottle. ''This bottle has been pumped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a very good vacuum. I then swept it out with helium</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas. Then it was pumped out again. I hope to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">this into some gas-filled region, where the gas will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to leak in, but the air won't. When it comes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">going out again, the gas will have to fight air pressure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and will probably stay in. I cannot hope to find its mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lecular weight by any normal means. Probably the Pirate</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't know it--hut I will be able to get a known</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of the sample, the weight being the difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the weight before and after the gas attack.

I can't hope to learn much that</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be very useful, for the organic tables are so blamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">complex, that a mere empirical formula won't mean a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. C.H„0 is the formula for ethyl alcohol--or it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the formula for methyl ether.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be able to get the empirical formula, though, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any organic compound is apt to decompose easily, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will just heat my cylinder in a furnace till the gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">is broken down, then it will be easy to analyze the</seg><seg type="columnLine">residue."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not a chemist!

A few minutes later he landed on the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Transcontinental Airways shops, entered them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went to the office of the Designing Engineer, John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fuller, an old schoolmate. They had been able to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other before, for Fuller had not paid as much at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention to theoretical physics as he might have, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he was probably one of the outstanding aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nautical designers, he often consulted Arcot on the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">theoretical details that he needed. Probably it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arcot who derived the greatest benefit from this asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciation, for the ability of. the designer had many times</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought his theoretical successes to practical commercial</seg><seg type="columnLine">production. Now, however, he was consulting Fuller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the plane he was to take that afternoon for</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Francisco was to be slightly changed for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stayed in Fuller's office for the better part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour, then returned to the roof and thence to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own roof, where Morey junior was waiting for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello Dick!

They went directly to the private office which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been assigned to them aboard. It was right next</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mail-room, and through the wall between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two a small hole had been cut. Directly beneath this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole was a table, on which the two men now set up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small moving-picture camera they had brought with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How many of the gas sample bottles did you bring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill?" asked Arcot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jackson had only four ready, so I brought those.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think that will be enough from what he said.

Let's see your</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chief engineer was lounging about in a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair in his cabin. The walls of the little metal room</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lined with meters and rheostat controls. He wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would get started. He was a little disgruntled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, his mates had been kidding him at the lunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">room--he was now "chief engineer of the Invalid's Fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Wheel Chair"! He was rather glad to be gassed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on these trips. It made the trip even shorter. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up at the long rows of meters and smiled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What did they spend all that money for? No one ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid any attention to those things except once in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">month, when the planes were run by the shop specialists;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then they checked things up, but the automatic devices</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed the whole thing anyway. His principal duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in keeping his men at the engines, and inspecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apparatus occasionally. But if anything went</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong--a plane had had trouble three years ago and</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended to the six-mile level before the engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been able to get the machines working correctly</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. No hum--hullo--some visitors. Well, here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little diversion while he waited for the starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal.

I guess we can go down to the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine room in the nose of the ship. This is the Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engineer's control room. That board there represents</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main engine. It covers most of that side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room; there are most of the controlling relays for</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting and running it. The engines are really run</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the control mechanisms. You know those were begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">over two hundred years ago, and through that time they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have passed through all the stages.

Then about that time relays were de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped to control the action of the big planes that de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped.

Each airline has a radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam station at each end, and several scattered along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way. These direct the instruments which control the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the ship. The height is controlled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio reflection altimeter. This gives us ground height,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the altitude from the ground itself, not from sea level--</seg><seg type="columnLine">it makes it possible for these big planes to land them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves automatically. The plane will no doubt be gassed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you probably know, and it will then continue its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled automatically. Freight lines frequently op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erate that way during rush periods. No pilot goes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and no crew. There is a landing beacon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">projects a radio wave from the exact center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field.

These rollers</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been nearly completely countersunk, and wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here is the main engine room. That engine there</seg><seg type="columnLine">develops about 25,000 horsepower. There are two</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller engines, one on each side, out in the wings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These develop only about 15,000 apiece. These are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usual American type engine, the Arcot coal engine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">patterned after the old Diesel engine. They were de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped by Arcot senior about fifty years ago, and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been little improved since, though young Arcot has</seg><seg type="columnLine">added a new type of vibration damper. They burn</seg><seg type="columnLine">powdered coal, by the compression ignition method.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coal is powdered to an exceedingly fine dust and blown</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cylinders, where the up-stroke compresses the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air to about 1,500 pounds to the square inch. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel is burned with about thirty-nine percent efficiency,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as compared to the old di-phenyl-oxide vapour turbines</seg><seg type="columnLine">which developed about ten per cent at best. The fuel is</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid, and easily handled, and further, there is no fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The engines have sixteen cylinders of rather small</seg><seg type="columnLine">size, for it was found that small cylinders with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressures and several in number gave higher efficiency</seg><seg type="columnLine">and less vibration than fewer large ones. The big</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism up there reduces the speed of the engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft to a speed that can be used on the props.

Fuel they had in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the form of coal. For many years the problem had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been staring them in the face, and they had really</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved it. Of course there still remained the oil shales,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they could not be worked economically because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cost of extracting the oil. It was cheaper to import</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lubricants they had to have. These they tried to eke</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with copious amounts of graphite, and re-refining.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then about 2070 some genius, many claim the honor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">got the very sensible idea that it was time they started</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising their own oil. Now, as we fly over western</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kansas, you will see vast fields of green plants. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, clear across the country, the green will continue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They are the gigantic plantations where our oil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of our fuel is grown. The cornstalks are used as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel and a dozen other things by fermentation by par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular bacterial ferments. Alcohol is the usual product,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but many others can be obtained. Further west, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">staple crop is castor oil beans. That is the source of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our lubricating oil. Some man dug the secret out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some century and a half-old book, for in the days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the development of the automobile it was found that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">petroleum was not good enough at that time, to use in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expensive racers, and they used castor oil, which did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not trouble them by dissolving the gasoline. That big</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank up there is the main supply. It is loaded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">synthetic graphite also, for even that needs a little thin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to go round. Our fields aren't big enough yet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">castor oil bean plant is one of the necessities of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. It supplies our oil, and it helps supply our</seg><seg type="columnLine">alcohol. Of course, wc do use hydrogenated coal to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight extent still, but the main fuel is alcohol. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you manage in England? You do not have enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">area for castor oil production, and not enough coal left."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ARCOT and Morey had not been prepared for this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Morey happened to be up oil those facts at</seg><seg type="columnLine">present from a recent trip to European cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, we arc using methyl alcohol as our fuel. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">ethyl alcohol used commercially can be prepared by fer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentation with your great area, but we have been forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather to extremes. As you know, we are now synthesiz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the staple items of our food directly. Our coal t&lt;x&gt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">is nearly exhausted and we are beginning to wonder if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old idea that Englishmen had was so good. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know we used to sell our coal by the millions of tons to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships every year. Now we need it badly. We have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to use our great deposits of limestone and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">carbonates as our source of carton. The usual practice</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to electrolyse sea water for the chlorine and the sodium</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as the hydrogen. The II and the Cl are burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">together to give the acid. This is used to treat limestone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to produce the COL. needed in industry, the heat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaction producing CO= by the direct decomposition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limestone. The calcium chloride is now a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">important by-product, while the COs thus obtained is</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to produce the necessary foods and fuels. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual system is to treat it with hydrogen gas and produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">methyl alcohol. This is then synthesized up to sugars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other simple foods. The power we use comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly from the sea by the process of using the differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence in temperature of the sea water at great depths and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the surface.

Then our little movie show</seg><seg type="columnLine">will 110 doubt be of interest!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was a low rumble that quickly mounted to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">staccato roar as the great propellers began whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the engines took up the load. The ground began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash behind them; the giant plane was waddling awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly across the surface, like a great duck, then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, as flying speed was reached, there was a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">start, the roaring bark of the engine took on a deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone, the rocking stopped and the ground was dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Like some mighty wild duck, the plane was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, a graceful, sentient thing, wheeling in a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle as it headed back for San Francisco, for the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been from the east when the ship took off. Now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane was climbing steadily in a long bank; up, up, up</seg><seg type="columnLine">she went, and gradually the terrific roar of the engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">died to a low throbbing hum as the low pressure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air silenced the noise, a sound proof vacuum was around</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Below them the giant city was contracting as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ship rode higher. The tiny private helicops were</seg><seg type="columnLine">darting about below them like streams of nigh invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">individuals, creeping black lines among buildings of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities. The towering buildings shone in the noon sun in</seg><seg type="columnLine">riotous hues as the colored tile facing reflected the bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant sunlight with glowing warmth of color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a city of indescribable beauty now. It was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the things that made this trip so worth-while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the shining city was dropping behind them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the soft green of the Jersey hills, and the deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple-black of the sky above surrounded them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun was blazing high in the nigh-black heavens, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarefied air gave such slight diffusion effect, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corona was readily visible with the aid of a .smoked</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass. Around the sun, long banners in space, the Zodi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acal light gleamed dimly. Here and there some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter stars gleamed in the dark sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">236</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Below them the landscape was swinging slowly by.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even to these men who had made the trip dozens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, the sight was one to inspire, and hold one's atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. it was such a thing as had never been visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the development of these super-planes. Whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying observatories had been made that had taken photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphs at heights of fiiteen miles, where the air was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarefied that the plane had to travel close to eight hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred miles an hour to stay up. Giant power was needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to maintain this speed, and only on rare occasions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machines taken so high, bul the flexibility allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">far better observation of solar eclipses than had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">been possible, for but once in a century would an eclipse</seg><seg type="columnLine">occur in the region of a large observatory'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already ahead of them Arcot and Morey could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great splotch of color that was Chicago, the mightiest</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of the Earth. Situated as it was in die heart of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">North American continent, with great water and ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing facilities and broad plains about it, it made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect air-port, and the sea no longer meant much, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was now only a source of power, recreation and food.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ships were no longer needed. Planes were faster, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air resistance being so much less, it was more econom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical also. With its already great start toward ascendancy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago had rapidly forged ahead, as the air lines devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oped with the great super-planes. The Euro]&gt;ean planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">docked here, and it was the starting point oi the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">American lines. But now, as they swung high above</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, the glistening walls of soft-colored tiles made it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great mass of clumging, flashing color beneath them. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">they passed they could see a great air'liner, twice the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of their plane, taking off for Japan, its five giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">propellers visible only as flashing blurs as it climbed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them. Then it was out oi sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was over the green plains of Nebraska that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pirate worked, so there the men became more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert, waiting for the first sign of abnormal sleepiness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tenseness made them yawn, and each immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to start the camera lest they miss the raider.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They soon realized, however, that it was only their</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervousness that made them yawn so. They sat quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not talking; listening intently for some new note, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing all the while that any sound the Pirate might</seg><seg type="columnLine">make would be more than drowned out in the whirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of the air sweeping past the giant airfoils of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Arcot who first began to feel sleepy, and soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">he decided that it was not imagination. He glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepily toward Bill, who was already lying down. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it a tremendous effort of the will to make himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach up and close the switch that started the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">camera whirring almost noiselessly. It seemed he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled his arm back--he just--lay there--and-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A white uniformed man was bending over him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes. To one side of him he saw Morey</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling down at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a fine guard, Arcot. T thought you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to stay awake and watch them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no, I left a much more efficient watchman! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't go to sleep--I am willing to bet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, iL may not have gone to sleep, but the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">here tells me it has gone somewhere else. It wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in our room when we woke up. I think the pirate</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it and confiscated it. All our luggage, including</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gas sample bottles is gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is all right. I arranged for that. The ship</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was brought down by an emergency pilot and Fuller</seg><seg type="columnLine">had him fixed for me. He took care of the luggage so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no member of the pirate's gang could steal it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There might have been some of them in the ground crew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They will be turned over to us as soon as we see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency man.

I would suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for the next hour or so you take it easy to let your</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart get used to beating again. It stopped for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours, you know. It is hard to change a habit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some twenty-five or six years, but once changed, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to change back. You will be all right, though."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five men were sitting about the table, discussing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">results oi the last raid, in particular as related to Arcot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Morey. Fuller, and President Morey, as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Arcot, senior, and the two young men, were there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had consistently refused to tell what their trip had</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed, saying that piclures would speak better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could. So now the men adjourned to the library</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a small motion picture projector had been set up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the)r seated themselves in the darkened room, Arcot</seg><seg type="columnLine">set up the small screen, then returned to the projector</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started it. At once they were looking at the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensional image of the rnail-room aboard the air liner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have cut out a lot of useless film, and confincd the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture to essentials.

It went through all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motions of opening Lo admit someone, yet no nna en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your demonstration doesn't seem to show much yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. In fact, it shows much less than I had expected,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the senior Arcot. "But that door seems to open</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily. I thought they locked them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They did, bnt the Pirate just burned holes in it, so to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save expense, they don't anymore."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW' the scene seemed to swing a bit as the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit an unusually bad air bump, and through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window they caught a glimpse of one of the circling Air</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guardsmen. There suddenly appeared in the air a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flame. 11 hung in the air above the safe for an instant ;</seg><seg type="columnLine">described a strangely complicated set of curves; then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it hung for an instant in mid-air, it became a great flare.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In an instant it narrowed down to a little point of bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant red flame. This described a complex series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">curves and touched the safe at the top. In an inconceiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably short time the eight-inch thickness of tungsto-iri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dium alloy was glowing incandescent and running around</seg><seg type="columnLine">molten; a large flare of the red flame sprang out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">surround the point of flame, and this blew the molten</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal to one side, a shower of brilliant sparks. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting the metal rapidly now, not burning it, but blowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to one side, perfectly fluid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon the torch had cut a large circular piece of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly free, and it would soon drop into the safe. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the torch left the safe, again retracting itself in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncanny manner, no force seeming either to supply it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fuel or to support it thus, yet it burned steadily, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked rapidly and efficiently. No, in mid-air, it hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to work the projector for a few moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">by hand so that you may see this next bit of film."</seg><seg type="columnLine">PIRACY PREFERRED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">237</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Arcot moved a small switch and the machine blinked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving a strange appearance to the seemingly solid images</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were thrown on the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pictures seemed to show the flame slowly descend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing till it touched the metal again. Again the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed, then, as suddenly as the extinguishing of a light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safe was gone!

No wonder the Air Guardsmen couldn't And</seg><seg type="columnLine">him \" exclaimed Arcot, senior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The projector had been stopped exactly on the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame, showing the invisibility of the safe. Then Arcot</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you are right, dad," he said, "but notice this</seg><seg type="columnLine">next frame."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now there appeared a picture of the room again, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window beyond, the mail clerk asleep at his desk, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing as before, except that in the place of the safe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE WAS A SHADOWY, HALF VISIBLE SAFE, the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing brightly, and beside ,it there was visible a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy man, holding the safe with a shadowy bar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort. And through both of them the frame of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window was perfectly visible, and, ironically, an Air</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guardsman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems that for an instant his invisibility failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. Probably it was the contact with the safe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused it. What do you think, dad ?" asked Arcot, junior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It docs seem reasonable. I can't see off-hand how</seg><seg type="columnLine">his invisibility is even theoretically possible. Have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">any ideas ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, dad, I have, but I want to wait till tomorrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">night to demonstrate them. Let's adjourn this meeting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you can all come tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next evening, however, it seemed that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arcot himself who could not be there. He had asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morey, junior, to tell them he would be there later, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had finished in the lab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dinner was over now, and the men were waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather impatiently for Arcot to come. They heard some</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise in the corridor, and looked up, but no one came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Morey," asked Fuller, "what did you learn about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gas the pirate was using? I remember Arcot said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have some samples to analyze."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'As to the gas, Dick found out but little more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had already known. Tt is a typical organic com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound, one of the metal radical type, and contains one</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom of thorium. This is a bit radioactive, as you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dick thinks that this may account in part for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to suspend animation. Thorium has a valence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of four, as have many o£ the semi-organic metal radicals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is thus able to replace carbon in some structures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, since it was impossible to determine the mole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular weight, he could not say what the gas was, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the empirical formula was CaaTh H,,,0 .rN-. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see it is a very complex molecule. It broke down at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature of only 89° centigrade. The gases left</seg><seg type="columnLine">consisted largely of methane, nitrogen, and methyl ether.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick is still in the dark as to what the gas is. Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">over there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men turned with one accord toward the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the room, looked, and seeing nothing particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual, glanced back rather puzzled. What they then</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw, or better, failed to see, puzzled them still more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no doubt Morev could not be seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why--why where--ohhhli! Quick work, Dick!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The senior Arcot was laughing heartily, and as the aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished and curious pair looked toward him, he stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and called out, "Come on, Dick! We want to see you</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. And tell us how it is done! 1 rather think Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morey here--T mean the visible one--is still a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled." There was a short laugh from the air--cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly there could be nothing else there--then a low but</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct click, and both Morey and Arcot were miracu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lously present, coming instantaneously from nowhere, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's senses could be relied on. On Arcot's back there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strapped a large and rather hastily wired mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">--one long wire running from it and out into the labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. He was carrying a second piece of apparatus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">similarly wired. Morey was touching a short metal bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Arcot held extended in his hand, using a table knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a connector, lest they get radio frequency burns on</seg><seg type="columnLine">making contact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have been very busy getting the last connection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this portable apparatus rigged up. I have the thing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">working order, as you see--or rather, didn't see. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">other outfit here is the tiling that is more important to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. It is a bit heavy, so if you will dear a space, I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">set it down. Look out for my power supply there--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire is carrying a rather dangerously high E.M.F. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to connect with the lab. power supply to do this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had no time to rig up the beautiful little mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pirate must have.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have duplicated his experiment. He has simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">made use of a principle known tor some time, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no need for it, they haven't used it. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">found back in the early days of radio, as early as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first quarter of the twentieth century, that very short</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavelengths effected peculiar changes in metals. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown that the plates of tubes working on very short</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves became nearly transparent. The waves were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, however, that they were economically useless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would not travel in usable paths, so they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">never developed. Furthermore, the apparatus developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be made to handle them. In the last war they</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to apply the idea for making airplanes invisible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they could not get their tubes to handle, the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed, so they had to drop it. However, with the tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">I recently got out on the market, it is possible to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">down there. I think our friend the pirate has developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">this thing to a point where he could use it. You can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that invisibility, while interesting, and a good thing for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage and vaudeville, is not very much of a commercial</seg><seg type="columnLine">need. No one wants to be invisible in any honest occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pation. Invisibility is a tremendous weapon in war, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pirate just started a little private war, the only way</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could make any money on his invention. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants it. People can't use an invisible plane--they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">run too much risk of being crashed. If two oi the blamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">things were in the neighborhood, it could never be known</seg><seg type="columnLine">when one might run into the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His gas, too, made the tiling attractive. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably discovered that before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"'TpHE whole thing looks to me to be the work of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A madman. He is not violently insane; probably just</seg><seg type="columnLine">has one particular obsession. His scientific bump cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly shows no sign of weakness.

He is insane in one branch only. But he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed this machine for invisibility, and naturally he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can fly in and out of the air guard, and they will never</seg><seg type="columnLine">know he's there, provided their microphonic detectors</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't locate him. But they have a mighty poor chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe that he uses some form of glider. He cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">use an internal combustion engine, for the light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosions in the cylinders would be as visible as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinders were made of clear fused quartz. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot have an electric motor, for the storage of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy would be a weighty matter--the cells would</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessarily weigh too much. Furthermore, if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">using any sort of prop, the noise of the air around it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would give him away. If he used a glider, the noise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great ship so near would be more than enough to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slight sounds.

We have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic hydrogen welding for some time, and atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen releases some 100,000 calories per mole of</seg><seg type="columnLine">molecular hydrogen, two grams of gas give one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand calories. Oxygen has not been prepared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any commercial quantity in the atomic state. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching that man's torch, from the color of the flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other indications, I gather that he uses a flame of</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic oxygen-atomic hydrogen for melting, and sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds it with a preheating jacket of atomic hydrogen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since oxygen lias two valenccs instead of one, its heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of formation is greater. The center flame probably de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velops a temperature of some 4000° centigrade, and will</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally make that tungsten alloy run like water. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there has never been any commercial way of storing</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic hydrogen; it has always required a big electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">power supply, and expensive apparatus. Since this fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low was able to use it as a portable welding and cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">tool he has a means of storing it. I rather believe he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolves it in some substance. Remember the difficulties</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they had in storing acetylene? They could not store it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the liquid state as it would often explode. They finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved the problem by dissolving it in acetone. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the pirate has found some liquid that will store his</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic hydrogen under slight pressure. That is tlie</seg><seg type="columnLine">only way he could produce the results he has. Now, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this machine here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is, as I said, a machine which impresses very high</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequencies on the body it is connected with. This puls</seg><seg type="columnLine">the molecules in vibration at a frequency approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of light, and when the light impinges upon it, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">can pass through readily. You know that metals transmit</seg><seg type="columnLine">light for short distances, but in order that the light pass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the molecules of metal must be set in harmonic vibration</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a rate approaching the frequency of light. If we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">impress such a vibration on a piece of matter it will then</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmit light very freely. If we impress this vibration</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the matter, say the body, electrically, we get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same effect, and the body becomes perfectly transparent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, since it is the vibration of the molecules that makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light pass through the material, it must be stopped if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we wish to see the machine.

What chance has one to detect a</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine that is perfectly transparent when there is noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but perfectly transparent air around it? It is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious property of this vibrational system of invisibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the index of refraction is made very low. It is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same as that of air, but the difference is so slight that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is practically within the limits of observation error; so</seg><seg type="columnLine">small is the difference that there is no 'rainbow' effect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The difference of temperature of the air would give</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Now, since this vibration is induced by radio impulse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is it not possible to impress another, opposing radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse, that will overcome this tendency and bring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible object into the field of the visible once more?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is; and this machine on the table is designed to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly that.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance record took someone across the Atlantic in 2009,</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't it?

The two men worked in sepa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate laboratories, except when either had a particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult problem that might be solved by the other. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the new development lay in the field of short</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave research of some sort, but they could not find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in what way it concerned the problem in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the meal was over, and Arcot was ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstrate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dad, I believe that you have been trying to develop</seg><seg type="columnLine">a successful solar engine. One that could be placed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wings of a plane to generate power from the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling on that surface. In all solar engines, what is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest problem to lie solved?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '■'Well, the more I investigate the thing, the more I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder which is the greatest. There are a surprising</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of annoying problems to be met. I should say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, that the one big trouble with all solar engines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminating the obvious restriction that they decidedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">aren't dependable for night work, is the difficulty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting an area to absorb the energy. If I could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough area, I could use a very low efficiency and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">have cheap power, for the power is absolutely free.

I have merely lapped the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the earth has already absorbed for me. Come here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He led the way down the corridor to his laboratory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and switched on the lights. On the main laboratory bench</seg><seg type="columnLine">was set up a complicated apparatus of many tubes and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy bus bar connecters. From the final tube two thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires ran to a long tubular coil.

Arcot stepped up to the controls and closed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch. The lights dimmed a bit, but immediately bright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened again, and from the other end of the room came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, steady hum as the big transformer took up the load.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, from the sound of that ten K.W. transformer</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, if this engine is very efficient we ought to get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific amount of power out of it." Dr. Arcot was smil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing amusedly at his son. "I can't very well control this</seg><seg type="columnLine">except by standing directly in front of it, but I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know what you're doing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, this is a laboratory model, and I haven't gotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing into shape really.

ARCOT slowly rotated the rheostat. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ a slight hum from the coil; then it was gone. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be no result. He rotated it a bit more; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a slight draught in the room apparently, but he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see no startling results, so he rotated the rheostat con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderably more. This time there was absolutely no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to the results. There was a roar like a fifty-foot wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel, and a mighty blast of cold air swept out of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">coil like a six-inch model of a Kansas cyclone. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose piece of paper in the laboratory was driving madly</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the blast of air Lhat had suddenly leapt out. Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arcot was forced back as by a giant hand, but in reeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">back his hand was lifted from the relay switch, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a thud it had opened the circuit. In an instant all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise was gone, and only a slight drifting of the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the room told of the blast that had stirred it up so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The astonished physicist came forward and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a moment in silence, while each of the other men</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him.

Then, with the aid of Arcot and Morey, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">design of the new machine was begun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "First, let's get some idea of the most advisable shape,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fuller said. "We will want a streamlined shape; roughly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  speaking, a cylindrical shape modified to fit the special</seg><seg type="columnLine">uses to which it will be put. You 110 doubt have more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the general plan in mind, Arcot. Suppose you sketch</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I thought it would be best to design it also as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an experimental ship. We don't know much about this</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, and we have to work it out. You will have plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fun figuring out strains in this machine, so let's be safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and use a factor of safety of 5. That will also give us</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavier machine to do the testing with."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Iii the first place, it must be proof against the Pirate's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas, for we won't be following the regular lanes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments to guide us safely, if we go out. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that over, and I think that the best system is</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what we used in the sample bottles--a vacuum. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas is stopped by nothing, so to speak, but there is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance that will stop it! It will no doubt penetrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer shell, hut on reaching the vacuum, it will tend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay there, between the inner and outer walls. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will tend to collect, since it will be fighting air pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure in its attempts to go either in or out. The pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside will force it back, and the pressure outside will</seg><seg type="columnLine">force it in. If we did not pump it out, it would soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">build up pressure enough to penetrate the interior wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, since the stuff can leak through any material, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of a pump shall we use? It won't be pushed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piston, for it will leak through either the cylinder walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the piston. A centrifugal pump would be equally in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">effective. The obvious solution is a mercury vapor pump,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which will, of course, take it out, and keep a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacuum, the difficulty l&gt;eing that that land of a pump has</seg><seg type="columnLine">too low a volume of rating. We never would make any</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress. The thing would be impossible but for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">new machine. With it we can just, have a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings in the wall of the outer shell and set in them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of these molecular, motion directors, and direct the</seg><seg type="columnLine">molccules out! They can't come in through it, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will tend to go out. That will protect us' from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pirate's gas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But now comes another difficulty. If we protect our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves against the Pirate's gas by a vacuum, we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember that our vacuum is an equally good protection</seg><seg type="columnLine">against heat ! Since our generator is intended to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">on heat energy, it will lie rather chilly inside if we don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">remedy that. Of course, our power units will he placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, where the blast of air will wrarm them, but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">really won't have a very good streamline effect if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang a big electric generator outside. The solution is</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious--if we can't bring the generator to the air, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must bring the air to it. We will have all the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment in this room here in the back, and the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">room up in front, here. The relays for controlling will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be back here, so we can control electrically the operation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the power equipment from our warm, gas-tight room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If it gets too warm in there, wc can cool it by using a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little of the heat to help accelerate the ship. If it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">too cold, we can turn on an electric heater run by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">generator. The air for the generator can come in through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small sort of scoop on top, and leave through a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening in the rear. The vacuum at the tail will assure</seg><seg type="columnLine">us a very rapid circulation, even if the centrifugal pump</seg><seg type="columnLine">action of the enclosed generator isn't enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For experimental purposes we will want the generator</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be greatly over power so that we can make tests over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a greater range. I don'L believe we will need more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred kilowatts altogether, but we should install</seg><seg type="columnLine">PIRACY PREFERRED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">243</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">about a thousand, for convenience--A.C., of course, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">vve can send it through transformers. We will need</seg><seg type="columnLine">batteries in the keel for starting the generator. Once the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed is high enough, it will be self-supporting, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">can have a small auxiliary D.C. machine to recharge the</seg><seg type="columnLine">batteries and to run the relays. About ten kilowatts will</seg><seg type="columnLine">do there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But let's begin making actual figures on this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the rest of the day the three men were working</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the general plan of the new ship, trying to calculate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strengths needed, supplementing mathematics with</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual experiments with the machines 011 hand. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to put the batteries inside the main control room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lest they freeze at extreme altitudes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be two days before they had finished. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculating machines were busy continuously, for here</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were few rules that experience could give them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were developing something entirely new, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they had as a designing staff three of the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most mathematicians in the world it was a problem that</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested them to the utmost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the evening of the first day, however, they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to give the finished designs for the power units to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mechanics who were to make them. The order for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storage battery and the standard electrical equipment</seg><seg type="columnLine">load been placed at once. By the time they had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted the drawings for the main castings, the materials</seg><seg type="columnLine">were already being assembled in a little private camp that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morey owned, up in die hills of Vermont. The giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight helicopters could land readily in tlie wide field</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been cleared on the small plateau, in the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which nestled a little blue lake and a winding trout</seg><seg type="columnLine">brook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mechanics and electrical engineers had been sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">up there already--officially 011 vacation. The entire pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gram could be carried out without attracting the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention, for sudi orders from the great Transconti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nental lines were so frequent that no importance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four days after the final plans had been completed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last of tlie supplies were being assembled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">portable metal shed that was to house tlie completed</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine. The shining tungsto-steel alloy frame members</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rapidly being welded in place by tlie cathode ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">welding torches in the hands of skilled artisans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already at tlie other end of the shop the generator</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been arranged for use wsith the molecular motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">power units.

They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bo installed on the frame in the morning, and the genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor would be hoisted into place with the small portable</seg><seg type="columnLine">crane. The storage batteries were connected up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in place in the hull. The great fused quartz windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">were resting in their cases on one side of the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting the complete application of tlie steel alloy plates.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were to be over an inch thick, an unnecessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickness, perhaps, but they had no need to economize</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight, as witnessed by their choice of steel instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light metal alloys throughout the construction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three men had arrived late that afternoon in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small helicopter, and had gone directly to the shops to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what progress had been made. They had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to remain in New York to superintend the ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the necessary supplies to the camp site, and since</seg><seg type="columnLine">no trouble was anticipated in the making of the steel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">framework, they had not felt it necessary to come. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now they would be able to help, and to superintend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more delicate work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She is shaping up nicely, isn't she!" Arcot was gaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the rapidly rounding frame with a critical eye..</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unhindered as they were by the traditional shapes, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings or other protuberances, they had been able to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">design a machine of striking beauty. The ship was to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be left in the natural shiny metal, the only protection</seg><seg type="columnLine">being a coat of tlie newly discovered "passivity paint"--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a liquid chemical that could be brushed or sprayed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron, chromium, nickel or cobalt alloys rendering them</seg><seg type="columnLine">passive to practically all chemical agents. Iron can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendered "'passive" by treating in very concentrated nitric</seg><seg type="columnLine">acid, the result being a piece of iron that is unattacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by nitric acid, sulphuric, or even aqua regia, which will</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolve gold and platinum, and to a certain extent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">iridium. This new "paint" produced a much more per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manent passivity in iron, leaving the iron or steel as</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiny as ever, but overcast with a beautiful iridescence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and immune to tlie most powerful reagents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE three men miked around the rapidly growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull, and looked with excited interest at the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">welded joints and the great beams. The ship seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of withstanding a fall of several hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with litde damage. The location of the power units was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly visible, and easily recognized, for at each point</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came together four or five great beams, welded</seg><seg type="columnLine">into one great mass of tough metal, and in it there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">set the heavy tungsten bolts that would hold tlie units</seg><seg type="columnLine">in place. Stronger than steel, tungsten had a great ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage here, for its long fibrous structure made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarly resistant to shearing strains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They inspected each joint minutely for signs of flaws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">using a small portable X-ray fluoroscope to see the inte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rior of the metal. Each joint seemed perfect. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">retired, satisfied everything was ready for the work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning began early with a long swim in the lake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a hearty breakfast of country farm produce, a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare to diese city-bred men. Then the work on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great framework was continued, and that day saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power units bolted in place, removable if change was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought advisable. Each power unit was equipped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">long streamlined copper fins lying close to tlie rounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull, that they might absorb heat more rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day by day the structure neared completion, and, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the large crew of specially skilled workers, the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was practically complete within a week. Only the instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments remained to be installed. Then at last even these</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been put hi place, and with the aid of Fuller, Morey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">junior, and his own father, Arcot had connected their</seg><seg type="columnLine">many complicated 'circuits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Son," remarked Arcot's father, looking critically at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great switchboard, with its maze of connections, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">many rheostats and controls, and its heavy busbar con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nectors behind it, "any man who can keep his eye on</seg><seg type="columnLine">those instruments must be a close relative of the insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their many-faceted eyes.

All we</seg><seg type="columnLine">need is the seats--they are to be special air-inflated gyro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopically controlled seats, to make it impossible for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden twist of the. ship to put the strain in the wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. Of course the main gyroscopes will balance</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship laterally, horizontally and vertically, hut each</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair will have a separate gyroscopic mounting for safety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want you to remember that this is an experimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">model, and not the finished ship. No machine, in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">history of invention, was truly perfected by any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. I have had the thoughts of four men helping me</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this, and the practical suggestions nf experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanics, the ideas of old workers, and I believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine will function perfectly, but I want to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to watch the working of every smallest piece of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I will'practice the manipulation of the machine for</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least four days before I try to chase the Pirate. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ordinarily rccommend the greatest haste, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man has stolen close to ten millions now, and is still at it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That would not be done by anyone in his right mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just think, the War Department thought that gas so</seg><seg type="columnLine">important that they have obtained a pardon for him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition they be permitted to have the secret of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They demand the return of the money, and I have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt he has it. I am firmly convinced that he is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kleptomaniac. I doubt greatly if he will stop taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">money before he is caught. Therefore it will be safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wait until we can be sure of our ability to operate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine smoothly. To start out without practice when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are operating such a tremendously powerful airship</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be suicidal. Also, I am having some of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">tool-makers make up a special type of molecular motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine for use as ft machine gun. The bullets are steel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about three inches long, and as thick as my thumb. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be perfectly streamlined, except for a little stabilizer</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the tail, to act as a guider. They will not spin as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle bullet does, aHd so there will be no gyroscopic effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold them nose on, but the streamlining and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabilizer will keep them on their course. 1 expect than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be able to walk right through many inches of armour</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate, since they will have a velocity of over four miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "They will be fed in at the rate of about two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute--faster if I wish, and started by a small spring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They will instantly come into the field of a powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">molecular motion-director, and will at once be shot out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with terrific speed. It will be the first rifle ever made</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could shoot bullets absolutely parallel to the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bullets would go on forever without hitting the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">if 1 shot them when up above the. air, for they will follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">an orbit! At five miles a second, a thing is in equilibrium</seg><seg type="columnLine">between centrifugal force tending to throw it away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth, and gravity tending to pull it down, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. It will be accurate at all ranges, allowing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-carriage only.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But that is all wc can do today.

All the men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been kept isolated at the farm, lest they accidentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread the news of the new machine. It was with excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest that they helped the machine to completion. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns had not been mounted as yet, but that could wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three-thirty of the afternoon found the machine resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the great construction shed, completely equipped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to fly!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dick," said Morey as he strode up to him after testing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last of the gyroscopic seats, "she's ready to fly!

Look, there is a Government helicopter com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I guess we will start soon. Tell the men to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks out from under it and tow it out on the rollers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Get it at least ten feet beyond the end of the hangar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We will start it straight up, and climb up to at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">five miles, where we will have room to make mistakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely. When we learn to operate this thing, we want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember that the machine is infinitely more powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">than anything either of us ever laid our hands on before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While you are tending to that, I will see if T can induce</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Air Inspector to take a trip with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour later the machine had been rolled entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the shed.

For the firsi time the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out of the dimness of the construction shed, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">true features and lines were apparent. The four men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were to ride in it on its maiden voyage were off</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one side looking at the great gleaming metal hull. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">long sweeping lines of the sides told a story of perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamline, and implied high speed, even when it rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus inert on the ground. The bright, slightly iridescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel hull shone in sifvery contrast to the gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">copper of the power units' heat-absorption fins. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great clear windows in the nose and the low, streamlined</seg><seg type="columnLine">air intake for the generator seemed only to accentuatc the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of the graceful machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord, she's beautiful, isn't she, Dick!" exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morey, looking at the glistening hull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, she did shape up nicely on paper, too, didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">she.

The honor ol</seg><seg type="columnLine">having designed the first ship like that, the first heavier</seg><seg type="columnLine">than air ship lhat ever flew without wings or helicopter</seg><seg type="columnLine">propellers--that is something to remember. And I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is one of the most beautiful that ever flew, too."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, Dick," said his father, "let's get under way. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am anxious for the test."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The four men entered the ship and were strapped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gyroscopic seats. One by one they reported ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Officer, I want lo explain that these scats may seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a bit more active than one generally expects a seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be, but in this experimental machine, I have pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided all the safety devices I could think oi. The ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself won't fail, of that I am sure, but the power is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">great it might well prove fatal to us if we are not in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">position to resist the forces. You know all too well the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of sharp turns at high speed and the results of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the centrifugal force. This machine can develop such</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous power that I have lo make provision for it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You notice that my controls and the instruments are</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted on the arm of the chair really; that permits</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to maintain complete control of the ship at all limes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still permits my chair to remain perpendicular to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forccs. The gyroscopes in the base here cause the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire chair to remain stable if the ship rolls, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair can continue to revolve about this bearing here so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we will not be forced out of our seats. We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">always be 'sitting up' and never lying down or leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, as we would seem to be, if the chairs did not vary</seg><seg type="columnLine">in position with the forccs. The air inflation makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">them more comfortable. I sincerely hope you will find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine safe enough for a license. I know the nec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">essary maneuvers required by law, but I am not used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to handling this ship, and I will have to take it straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">up first.

"Main generators!" Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clicking switch, and the relays thudding into action,</seg><seg type="columnLine">again the rising hum, ''Seat-gyroscopes.'' The low click</seg><seg type="columnLine">was succeeded by a quick scream that died in inaudibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">high frequency as the separate seat-gyroscopes took up</seg><seg type="columnLine">their work. "Main power tul&gt;e hank!" The low hum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the generator behind changed to a momentary roar as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the relays threw the load on. In a moment the automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls had brought it up to speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything is working perfectly so far. Arc wc</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to start now, Son ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Main vertical power units I" The great ship trembled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout its length as the lift of the power units began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pull on it. A special instrument had been rigged tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porarily on the floor beside Arcot, that he might be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to judge the lift of his power units; it registered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent weight of the ship. It had read two hundred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now all eyes were fixed on it, as the pointer dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly to 150--100--75--50--40--20--10--there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">click and the instrument flipped back to 300--it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">registering in pounds now! Then the needle was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">zero, and the mighty structure floated into the air, slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving down the field as a breeze carried it along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Now the men outside saw it rise swiftly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky, straight toward the blue vault of heaven. In two</seg><seg type="columnLine">or three minutes it was disappearing. The glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship shrank to a tiny point of light; then it was gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It must have been rising at fully three hundred miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour ! The fastest racing helicopters seldom rose faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that! The record was three hundred and thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">two miles an hour!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the men in the car there had been a tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase in weight that had forced them into the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">cushions like leaden masses. Then the ground was""-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping away with a speed that made them look in</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement. The house, the construction shed, the lake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all seemed contracting beneath them. So quickly were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rising that they had not had time to adjust their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental attitude. To them all the world seemed shrinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them. Now they were at a tremendous height,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over twenty miles they had risen into the atmosphere; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air about them was so thin that the sky seemed black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars glazed out in cold, unwinking glory, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great fires oi the sun seemed reaching out into space</seg><seg type="columnLine">like mighty arms reaching--reaching to draw back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent body the masses of the wheeling planets. About</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, in far flung streamers of cold fire the mighty zodiacal</seg><seg type="columnLine">light stretched out into space, an Aurora on a titanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">scale. . For a moment they hung there, while they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">readings of the meters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never l&gt;egan to let out the power of this thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When these are made commercially, we will have to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">about or.e horsepower generators in them, or people will</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to see how fast it will go and will die of the terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceleration and leave the car, like some vast bullet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaking on through the sky at ever greater speeds, till</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last it throws itself off into space.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">power absorbed by the machine they knew and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculated, but the terrific power of the driving units</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far beyond their expectations. They had estimated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power of the machine as great, bul even they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been unable to calculate the power released.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, now we're off for some horizontal maneuvers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe I have satisfactorily demonstrated the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine's ability to hold itself in the air, to climb at a safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate to a considerable altitude.

I am now going to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">the necessary proof of ability to maintain traffic speed--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe they now require over two hundred miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. I will accelerate it at the greatest safe value."</seg><seg type="columnLine">246</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the seats swung beneath them a bit; then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the ship shot forward with ever greater speed, ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater acceleration, it seemed that it turned and headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward, although they knew that the main stabilizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">gyroscopes were holding it level. The seats swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath them as the acceleration became greater and</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater. In a moment the ship was headed out over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantic at a speed no rifle bullet had ever known. Faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">and faster the plane streaked along, until it became an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost invisible blur. The radio speedometer needle</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed farther and farther over as the speed increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to unheard of values. Before they left the North Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ican shoreline they were going over one mile a second.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The speed increased terrifically, as the men labored under</seg><seg type="columnLine">weights of seven to eight hundred pounds apiece. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were over the middle of the Atlantic before Arcot grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually shut off the acceleration, letting the seats drop back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into position. Once more they were able to judge up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down with some definite standard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had been able to watch the sun sink rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the horizon. It was night on the water rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">far beneath, but the sun's rays still reached them where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What speed did we reach, Dr. Arcot--look--there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coasL of Europe. Watch it come toward us. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast are we going?" asked die Air Inspector.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The air resistance is slowing us down. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling at tlie rate of three miles a second before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">decreased the acceleration. Now it has fallen to two and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half!" Dr. Arcot answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That decidedly checks off the speed requirement. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">how do you measure such terrific speed? You have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of using the air blast at that rate. What is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">system?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I had to develop one--but it is only accurate to about</seg><seg type="columnLine">one part in a hundred now. That's near enough for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">work For ordinary speeds we use the automatically</seg><seg type="columnLine">barometrically corrected airspeedometer. but this piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of apparatus depends on the use of radio. You do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">change the speed of light no matter how fast the source</seg><seg type="columnLine">is moving, but for that reason, if the source is moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward you, the waves get packed in closer together than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would ordinarily. 'Hie same is true of a radio wave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I send out a radio wave from a very small set in the nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ship, and pick it up by a set in the rear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. By means of the usual velocity measuring appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus I find the velocity of the wave as picked up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the set in the rear. That is electrically registered here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but instead of registering it as 186,285 miles per second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the appropriate number of tenths and hundredths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile per second, it subtracts the discovered value from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the correct value, the difference being, our speed. I hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get it more accurate in the future, but it is the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">serviceable means at hand now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'm going to try to see what the ultimate ceiling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this machine is. Remember, it must have a ceiling, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">it depends on the operation of the generator to operate</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlie power units. This, in turn, depends on the heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of air. Of course the main power units, being outside in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun's rays, are warmed to an extent by them. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how high it will work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship was put into a vertical climb, aud steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great machine rose, at a low rate lest they overshoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mark, and have the wrong result. Soon, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great generator behind began to slow down, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic controls could not bring it up to a sufficient</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. The readings of the instruments were dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly. The temperature of the exceedingly tenuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">air outside was so close to absolute zero that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly impossible to get sufficient energy from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get up some forward speed so that you will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aid of the air scoop to force the air in faster."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right, Morey." Arcot slowly applied tlie power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forward propulsion units. Slowly they took hold, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship began to move forward again. The increase was</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent at once. The machine quickly gained power</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she was rising again. But at last, at a height of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty-one miles, the ship would rise no farther. The cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cabin became unbearable, for every kilowatt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">power that the generator could get from the air outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">was needed to run the power units. The air, too, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting had, for tlie pumps could not supply enough, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oxygen tanks had not been carried on this trip. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were dropping, dropping, the machine was held</seg><seg type="columnLine">stable by the gyroscopes, but she was dropping freely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlie power of the generator being used to warm the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more. But the machine had fifty miles to fall, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as die air resistance of die denser air mounted, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could begin to feel tlie weight return as the air slowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them down in their fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've passed, but for the maneuvers, sir! The re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired altitude was passed so long ago--why we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">still some miles above it, I guess!

The Air Inspector was decidedly impressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I can't tell unless I point the nose of the ship down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the apparatus works only in the direction in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sliip is pointed. Hold on, everyone, I am going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start using some power to stop us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was night when they returned to the little field in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vermont. They had established a new record in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of aeronautical achievement except endurance! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">altitude record, the speed record, the speed of climb, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceleration record--all that Arcot could think of had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been passed. Now the ship was coming to dock for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. In the morning it would be out again. But now</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arcot was sufficiently expert with the controls to maneu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver tlie ship safely into the hangar. They finally solved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind difficulty by decreasing the weight of the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">to about fifty pounds, so enabling tlie three men to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry it into the hangar!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next two days were devoted to careful tests of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power factors of tlie machine, the best operating</seg><seg type="columnLine">frcqucncy, the most efficient altitude of operation, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as many other tests as they had time for. Each of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three younger men took turns operating it, but so great</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the strains of the sudden acceleration, that Arcot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">senior, decided it would be wisest to stay on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In die mean time reports of the Pirate liecame fewer</seg><seg type="columnLine">aud fewer as less and less money was shipped by air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arcot spent four days practicing the manipulation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine, for though it handled far more readily than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other machine he had ever controlled, there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger of turning on too much power under the stress</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sudden excitement. Yet he could not afford to lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlie limit of available power, for there must be a margin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of at least 32 feet per second to cover the effects of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If they were flying against it, they would need 64 feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">per second per second more acceleration than if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were flying with it.

He must make his actions in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively in emergencies, and the battle with the Pirate</seg><seg type="columnLine">was apt to be a long series of emergencies, for certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pirate had some weapons other than his gas. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">standard machine gun could throw a bullet through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch-thick armor-plate walls of the machine, and as these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were double, there was slight chance of any known ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying a gun heavy enough to pierce these double</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, which were yet light enough to land on the Trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">continental plane without disturbing its equilibrium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night before, Arcot had sailed the ship down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">alighted on the roof of Morey senior's apartment, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing enough power on to reduce the weight to but ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons, lest it fall through the roof, while he went down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the President of the Lines about some "bait" for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pirate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Send some cash along," said Arcot, when he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morey, Sr. "Say a quarter of a million, make it more</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less public knowledge, and talk it up so that the Pirate</seg><seg type="columnLine">may think there is a real haul on board.

I will try to locate him from there by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the radio disturbance locater, and if I have my appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus on, 1 naturally can't locate him. I hope he won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be scared away--but I rather believe he won't. At any</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate, you won't lose on the try!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AGAIN Morey and Arcot were looking at the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">• Jersey aerodrome, out on the great fields that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been broad marshes centuries before. Now they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been tilled in, and stretched for miles, a great landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, close to the great city across the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men in the car above were watching the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, hanging inert, a silent dot of glistening metal, high</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the deep velvet of the purple sky, for fifteen miles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">air separated them from the Transcontinental machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. Now they saw through their field-glasses that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great machine was lumbering slowly across the field,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaining momentum as it headed westward into the breeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the take-off. Then it seemed to be barely clearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great skyscrapers that towered twenty-four hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet into the air, arching over four or six dty blocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From this height they were toys made of colored paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft colors that glistened in the hot noon sun, and around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and about them were weaving lines of flashing, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">helicopters, the individual lost in the mass of the million</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so swiftly moving machines, for only the higher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady moving levels of traffic were visible to them. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low these they knew were other and still other levels of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines, hanging motionless or creeping along at thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">or forty miles an hour, rocking slightly, despite the gyro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopic stabilizers as the terrific air-wash of thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirring blades hit them, varying each moment as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded traffic moved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just look at those cars in the traffic below there!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thousands and thousands coming back into the city after</seg><seg type="columnLine">going home to lunch--and every day the number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">helicopters is increasing! If it hadn't been for your in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention of this machine, they would have been impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon. The airblast in the cities is unbearable now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting worse all the time. Many machines can't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough power to hold themselves up at the middle levels;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is a down current of over one hundred miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour at the 400-foot level in downtown New York.

I have to drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">in through there. I'm always afraid that somebody with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old worn-out bus will have stabilizer failure, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will work havoc with hundreds below.'' Morey was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">skilful pilot, and realized, as few others did, the dangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that downward airblast that the countless whirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">blades maintained in a constant roar of air. The office</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings now had double walls, with thick layers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound-absorbing materials, to stop the roar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cyclonic blast that continued almost unabated twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours a day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I don't know about that, Morey," replied Arcot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This thing isn't all to the good. .Remember that if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had about ten million machines hung in the air of New '</seg><seg type="columnLine">York City on the heat contained, there would be a no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticeable fall in the temperature. Tt would undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">di'op to a temperature that would produce an Arctic cli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate year in and year out. You know, though, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbearably hot it gets in the City by noon, even on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldest winter days, due to the heating effect of the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">friction of all the thousands of blades. I have known the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature of the air to go up fifty degrees, due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat of the engines and die friction of the blades. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution of the thing is obvious. There will be a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance between the two types of machines. It will be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific economical problem, but at the same time it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">solve the problem of the great companies who have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">fermenting grain residues for alcohol. The castor bean</seg><seg type="columnLine">growers are also going to bring down their prices a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">when this machine kills the market. They will also be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more anxious to extract the carbon from the cornstalks</seg><seg type="columnLine">for reducing ores of iron and of other metals. It will no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt have to be worked out eventually at any rate." As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship flew high above the Transcontinental plane, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men discussed the economic values of the different appli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cations of Arcot's discoveries from the huge power sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions they could make, to the cooling and ventilating of</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Arcot, you mentioned the cooling effect on New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York City; with the millions on millions of these ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines that there will be, with huge power plants, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand other different applications in use, will not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific drain of energy from the air cause the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world to become a little cooler?" asked Fuller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I doubt it," said Arcot slowly. "I have thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that myself. Remember that most of the energy we use</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually ends up as heat anyway. The lights we use</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn the electricity to light, whence it is radiated to be ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed by materials that convert it into heat. Motors</seg><seg type="columnLine">give off heat and mechanical energy. The propdlers</seg><seg type="columnLine">convert the mechanical energy to motion of the mole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cules of air--heat again. The forward drive of the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship is converted into heat through air-friction. Only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy we store as chemical energy is maintained--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually that leaks back into the air. In return, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember the decillious of ergs of energy that the sun is</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving off--true, we don't get more than an infinitesimal</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of that energy--but what wc do get is more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for us. Power houses can be established very</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveniently in the tropics, where they will cool the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the energy can be used to refine metals or to stabilize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carbon of carbon dioxide from the air. I understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">from something Dad said last night that that is what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is working on now. He has devised a method for clec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolyzing carbon dioxide in a solution in a compound</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson worked out for him. That brings us to carbon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">248</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tlie true starting- point for any organic synthesis. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we will have ail unlimited supply of acetylene, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one indispensable hydro-carbon in modern synthesis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That means that the surplus heat of the tropics will find</seg><seg type="columnLine">a use. Together with the weather control possible by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction-controi of great winds, we could set huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">director tubes on top of mountains, and blow the winds</seg><seg type="columnLine">in whatever direction best suited us, not the blown wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, but the vast volume of air it carried with it, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to cool the temperate zones in summer from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold of the poles, and warm it in winter with tlie heat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tropics. Similarly the tropics would, in this way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cooled. Of course the control could not be perfect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut it would bring about a vast improvement. I think,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that we will find this machine to be of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit. I don't think it will appreciably lower the mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And there is another thing it may make possible in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the future--a thing that is hard to acccpt as a commercial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">proposition. We have sources of energy now, but we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have no sources of materials that will last indefinitely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Copjier is becoming more and more rare. Had it not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been for the discoveries of the great copper fields of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sahara and in Alaska, we would not have any now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Platinum is exhausted, and even iron is becoming more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and more valuable, for low-grade iron ores cannot be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worked. We are facing a shortage of metals. Alumi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">num, magnesium, calcium, and iron exist in vast quanti-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ties, but they are largely in low concentration ores. Do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you realize that within the next two centuries we will be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unable to maintain this civilization unless we get new</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">i sources of materials? History shows us civilization after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">civilization falling before the invading hordes of bar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">barians--men who were better equipped to fight for what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they wanted. Within two centuries our civilization will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be helpless for lack of essential metals. Iron can be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gotten from the frames of the skyscrapers as they are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">replaced by little glass buildings. Glass, or silicon diox-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ide, practically constitutes a huge percentage of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth's crast. Silicon represents 28% and oxygen over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">47%, so in the available matter of the earth, two ele-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ments alone constitute more than three-quarters of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">resources. Luckily, the next most abundant element,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the next few are metals, aluminum, iron, calcium,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">magnesium, sodium and potassium. (I am not certain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about the order of calcium and magnesium.) Together,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">these total about 23%. That means that the first seven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">abundant elements constitute 98% of our available re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sources. All the other elements on earth do not total</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more than 2%! That means that, including the vast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quantities of hydrogen, nitrogen, and all other non-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">metals, chlorine, sulphur, and even carbon, and many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">metals such as copper, lead, zinc, tin, silver, tungsten,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">molybenum, berylium--all the other 85 elements--total</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only two per cent! Every time I think of those figures</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it frightens me. Aluminum, iron, and magnesium are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">useful for our work. Calcium, sodium, potassium--we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cannot use them; they are soft, and so active that they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">corrode rapidly in the air. In the 98% of the available</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">matter of tlie earth, three elements are useful. In the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two per cent lie all our other materials, except glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Well, it looks as if we had better start using glass a great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deal more!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Rut we have one other chance now. This civilization</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is doomed if we don't get more elements from some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The solution is--there are eight* planets in this solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system 1 Neptune and Uranus are each far vaster than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth; they are utterly impossible for life as we know it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a small colony might be established there to refine</seg><seg type="columnLine">metals for the distant earth. We might be able, to build</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight-closed citics. But first we could try tlie nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets--Mars, Venus, or some satellites such as our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moon. I pray that this machine will make it possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR some time they sat in silence in the machine as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they swept along, high above the green plains of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indiana. Chicago lay like some monster jewel far oft on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizon to the right and ahead. Below them the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk of the Transcontinental plane seemed a toy, five</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles below, as it swung slowly across the fields--actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling over six hundred an hour. They too seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost motionless as the landscape swung slowly past</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath them. At last Morey spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right, Arcot. We will have to think of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interplanetary aspects of this some day. Oh, isn't that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago off there ? We had better start the vacuum gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">protector. And I will turn the radio disturbance indicator</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to the general reception aerial till we see some signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of action."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three men forgot tlie impending danger of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortage of metals. There were a number of adjust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments to make, and these were quickly completed, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine forged evenly, steadily ahead. The generator</seg><seg type="columnLine">was adjusted to the maximum efficiency, the various</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes were tested separately, for though they were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">new, and each good for twenty-five thousand hours, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be inconvenient, to say the least, if one failed while</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were in action. Each tested perfect, and though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could not hear tlie even hum of the generator behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, due to the approximate vacuum at this altitude,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew from the smooth functioning of the various</seg><seg type="columnLine">relays lliat governed it as the loads on it varied, that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be working perfectly, at something less than one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">half maximum rating. There was a reassuringly large</seg><seg type="columnLine">factor of safety in all parts of this machine, which was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good thing on an experimental machine, but left no factor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of safety for Mr. Average Citizen's pocket book, if put</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the commercial production in this form.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steadily they flew on, waiting tensely for the first sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a glow from the tiny neon tube indicator on the panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Morey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This looks familiar, Dick," said Morey, looking about</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the fields and the low line of the blue mountains far</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil on the western horizon. "I think it was about here</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we took our little nap in the 'Flying Wheel Chair,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the papers called it. It would be about here th--</seg><seg type="columnLine">LOOK! It is about here! Get ready for action, Fuller.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're taking the machine gun, I'll work the invisibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">disrupter, and Arcot will run the ship. Let's go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the board before him the tiny neon tube flickered</seg><seg type="columnLine">dully, glowed for a moment like a piece of red-hot iron,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then went out. In a moment it was glowing again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then quickly its brilliance mounted till it was a line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson. Quickly Morey snapped the switch from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general radio disturbance detector to the beam receiver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he might locate the machine exactly, the receiving</seg><seg type="columnLine">set being arranged to pick up the signals emanating from</seg><seg type="columnLine">points in the beam only, and the same control kept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projector of the indivisibility disrupter in constant coor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dination, so that the sighting of the receiver automatically</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  •Since this storv was written, a ninth planet was discovered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">PIRACY PREFERRED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">249</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">directed the disrupter beam at the same point. Quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beam was scanning the sky below them, as it searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the plane of the Pirate. It was fully a minute be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the neon tube flashed into life once more. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirate was flying just ahead of the big plane, very likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">gassing them. All around him were the Air Guardsmen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaware that the enemy was so near. As the disrupter</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam could be projected only about a mile, they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to dive down on the enemy at once, and an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">later the great plane beneath them seemed to be rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them at terrific speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two radio beams were constantly kept focused on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane of the Pirate. When they were about two miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the two machines below them, the neon tube blazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up brilliantly as the energy of the two machines clashed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Pirate was trying to maintain his invisibility, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rapidly growing strength of the machine above was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to batter it down, the resulting interference radiat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing' a large amount o£ energy.. The strength of Morey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam was growing at a tremendous rate, as the two ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines approached at nearly three hundred miles an Lour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a moment the ammeter connected with the disrupter</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam began to rise so rapidly it seemed dangerous, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the ten-kilowatt set being used to project the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam, the resistance of the apparatus on board the pirate</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was amazing. Now, however, there was a rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">solidifying cloud before them, as the interference of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beam Morey was sending broke down the molecular</seg><seg type="columnLine">oscillation that permitted the light to pass freely through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine. Suddenly there was a circle of blue light</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the shadow form, and a moment later the ionized</seg><seg type="columnLine">air relapsed into normal condition as the pirate's appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus broke down under the strain. At once Morey shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his apparatus, convinced from the suddenness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pirate's apparatus had been blown out, the tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to stand the strain of the larger tubes on board</seg><seg type="columnLine">their machine. He glanced up to look at the pirate as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished his job. He cried out in astonishment as Arcot</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to him, "Morey--look at him go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morey was too late to see him go. Already the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shot off with terrific speed. It had shot up and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their left, at a rate of climb that seemed unl&gt;elievablc--</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that the long trail of flaming gas told the story!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The plane was propelled by rockets! The terrific accel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eration carried it out of their range oi vision in an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, and as Arcot swung the ship to bring him again</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the range of the windows, they gasped in aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishment, for already he was many miles away, a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail of flaming gas marking his swift flight! There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrific wrench as Arcot threw on all the power he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared, then quickly leveled the machine out, following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pirate at lighting speed. He increased the accelera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion further as the men grew accustomed to the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">that weighed them down. Ahead of them the pirate was</seg><seg type="columnLine">racing along, but quickly now they were overhauling him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his machine had wings of a sort! They produced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous amount of head resistance at their present</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity, for already the needle of the radio speedometer</seg><seg type="columnLine">had moved over to one mile a second. They were follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the fleet plane ahead at the rate of 3600 miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. The roar of the air outside was a tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave of sound, yet to them, protected by the vacuum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the double walls, it was detectable only by the vibration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And naturally the rarefaction of the air operated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduce the sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RAPIDLY the lead of the pirate's machine was cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, as their acceleration became greater. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed but a moment before he would be within range</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their machine gun. Suddenly he nosed down and shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the ground, ten miles below, with the full speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his machine. In an instant Arcot had swung his machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a loop that held him close to the tail of the pirate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The swift maneuvers at this speed were a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain on both men and machines--the acceleration</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed crushing them with the weight of four men, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arcott followed the pirate in a wide loop to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ended in a straight climb, the power rocket ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing on its tail, the rocket blast roaring out behind, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of fire a half mile long. It was climbing at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed that would have distanced any other machine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world had ever seen, but the tenacious opponent behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him clung ever tighter to the tiny darting thing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had released great clouds of his animation suspending</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas. To his utter surprise, the ship behind had driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">righL through it, entirely unaffected! He, who knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">most about the gas, had been tillable to devise a material</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop it, a mask or a tank to store it, yet in some way</seg><seg type="columnLine">these men had succeeded! And that hurtling, bullet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped machine behind! Like some miniature airship it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, but with a speed and an acceleration that put even</seg><seg type="columnLine">his to shame! It could twist, turn, dive, rise and shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">off on the straight-away with more flashing speed than</seg><seg type="columnLine">his machine displayed. Time and again he tried com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicated maneuvers that strained him to the utmost, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">that machine always followed after him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was one thing to do. In outer space his rockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">would support him. In a straight climb he shot up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing sun above, out into space, while the sky around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him grew black, and the stars shone in solemn splendor</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him. But he had eyes for only one thing, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining car that was rising with more than equal speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him. He knew he must be climbing over two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles an hour, yet the tracker came ever closer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just out of sighting range for the machine gun now . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a moment . . . but, she was faltering!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The men in the machine behind sat white-lipped, tense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the whirling shocks of sudden turns at terrific speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted the gyroscope seats around like peas in a rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball. Up, down, left, right, the darting machine ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">was twisting with unbelievable speed. Then suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nose was pointed for the zenith again, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great column of flame shooting out behind him, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading straight toward space!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If he gets there, T lose him, Morey I" said Arcot. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific acceleration of the climbing car seemed to press</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to their seats with a deadly weight. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor.to talk--but still the car ahead was shooting ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">--slowly they seemed to be overhauling him. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the velocities were perforce lowered by the effects of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity, and the air resistance of the atmosphere was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well nigh gone, only the acceleration that the human body</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stand was considered. The man ahead was pushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plane ahead with an acceleration that would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed many men!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly the acceleration of the machine was falling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arcot pushed the control over to the last ampere, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the slight surge, as greater power rushed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coils momentarily. Soon this was gone too, as the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erator behind faltered. The driving power of the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pheric heat was gone. More than sixty miles below them</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could see the earth as a greenish brown surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">250</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly convex, and; far to the east they could distin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guish a silvery line of water! But they had no eyes but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the column of shooting lianie that represented the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleeing raider! Out in airless space now, he was safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them. They could not follow. Arcot turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine once more, parallel to the earth, watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane above through the roof window. Slowly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine sank to the fifty-mile level, where there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just sufficient air to maintain it in efficient operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, he beat us! But there is only one thing for us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. He must hang there on his rockets till we leave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we can hang here indefinitely, if we can only keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">this cabin decently warm. lie has no air to cool him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has the sun to warm him, The only thing that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">worrying him right now is the heat of his rockets. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he can throw most of that out with the gases. Lord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's some machine! The principle is easy to see. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">uses his atomic hydrogen stored in the way he has, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereby can store, in very little space, a gaseous material</seg><seg type="columnLine">that yields 100,000 calories for every two grams. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">can run a real machine on that! But eventually his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rockets will give out, and down he will come, so we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">just hang here beneath him and--whoa--not so fast--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he isn't going to stay there, it seems; he is angling Ins</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship off a bit, and shooting along, so that, besides, holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself up, he is making a little forward progress.

Well, we can keep up to him, at our level."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dick, no plane ever made before would have stood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific pulls and yanks that his plane got. He was steer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and twisting on the standard type air rudders, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what strains he had! That unique type of plane must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be extremely strong. I never saw one shaped like his</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, though--it is the obvious shape at that! It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">j ust a huge triangular arrowhead!

I hope that man is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a kleptomaniac, because he can be cured of that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I can then have a new laboratory partner. He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">some exceedingly' intelligent ideas! His idea of copying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the birds was good--except that he carried it too far.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The idea of flying was good,, but the birds have a method</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man can't imitate. The birds have flapping wings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their wings are shaped to work well when they flap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man tried for a while to make a machine that would flap</seg><seg type="columnLine">its wings. He generally got killed in the attempt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally he decided to try having the wings there, just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the birds do, but not flapping them. He tried to- imitate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bird in gliding flight. That was rather foolish, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the birds' wings are made to flap, and when they glide</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are using them for a secondary purpose. Man stands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on two jointed bone columns, carefully made and fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">together with some of the most wonderful mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">features we know of. Why not build buildings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand them on similar mechanisms? Simply because legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">have oidy a secondary use in supporting members. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were primarily designed for locomotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Similarly a bird's wings were designed for movement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, too, a rotary motion is so much more efficient than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reciprocating motion. The wheel is beyond a doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a better way to get over ground than the leg. Why didn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Nature use it ? A wheel is not such a good thing to climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees with, and trees are very useful if a saber tooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiger happens to be in the neighborhood. Evolution did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not favor it. Can you imagine a bird with a propeller on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its beak ? The propeller is more efficient than the flapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing, but Nature couldn't use it--it was a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">design. Imagine, if you can, a bird with a bone propeller</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its lieak--or somewhere, driven by a hone crankshaft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned by muscles---muscles arranged like the cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an engine!

They watched the speedometer needle</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop. The speed was sinking very slowly, for the area</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the absorbing fins was not designed to absorb the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat directly, and was very inefficient. The sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed sinking below their horizon; they were just be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to watch that curious phenomenon of seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn backward, when they first struck air dense enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to operate the power units noticeably. Quickly the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">was applied till the machines sank rapidly to the warmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">levels, the only governing factor being the tendency ol'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glider to break loose from the grip of the magnet</seg><seg type="columnLine">At fifty miles the generator was started, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaters in the car at once became more active. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no heat in the car below, but that was unavoidable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would try to bring it down to warm levels quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whew, I'm glad we reached the air again, Dick.

The air resistance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glider forced them to go slowly, they could not average</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">much better than six hundred an hour despite the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the speed of either machine alone was over twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the great skyscrapers of San Francisco were</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing on their horizon, and thousands of private planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">started out to meet them.

They turned to each other in astonished inquiry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then came another cry of astonishment as it suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, hanging in the air a thousand feet above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of its disappearance! Then it began a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">loops, turns, twists and maneuvers utterly impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to any other machine. It hung motionless in the air for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant, then shot up toward the hot, mid-afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun with a speed that left the watchers gasping with</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment--and continued on its way to New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two weeks later Arcot had a visitor from the West</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coast--a handsome young man of about twenty-eight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morey was with him at the time.

At once four of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them drew from their armor the long- tubes we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted there, and trained them upon us. I knew, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively, that those tabes held some deadly force like</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhat with which the cylinders had attacked our space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier in the battle in mid-air. Later I was to learn that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tubes could release a force-ray similar to that used</seg><seg type="columnLine">for propulsion by our space-flier and by the cylinders--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a force-ray so concentrated into a pencil-like beam that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of merely pressing against whatever it struck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it pierced whatever it touched with terrific force, riving</seg><seg type="columnLine">it asunder.

To see</seg><seg type="columnLine">those bulging, glassy and insect-like eyes outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window so close to my own struck me through with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilling horror greater than anything I had yet felt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that the creature had discerned me inside the space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walker, had assured himself that creatures of life yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from himself occupied the two cylinders. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a moment he had clambered back down to the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then as he-uttered another sharp order, the creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">that held us were dragging us forward, toward the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the compartment into which we had looked before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through that low door they dragged us in our space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walkers, and across the adjoining compartment toward one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great upright cylinders resting there. In another</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the Neptunians had pulled us inside the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that cylinder into its dark opening, and I saw the one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given the orders following, with a half-dozen of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows. The others were dispersing to the other cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, and in a moment the door of our own slid clanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut behind us. Then there was a hissing and throbbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strange machinery in the dark interior of the cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us, and at the same moment the leader of the Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunians motioned to us to emerge from our space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walkers, having removed their own glowing ball-heaters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think that both Marlin and I hesitated for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment before complying with that command, yet we'</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that upon us still were trained the tubes of the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians who guarded us, so reluctantly we threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the lower doors of the space-walkers and emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them. As we did so, forgetful for the moment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange creatures about us, we gazed in amazed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest around us. The huge cylinder's interior, we saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was divided into a half-dozen compartments by metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">floors or ceilings, set at. intervals of ten or twelve feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its bottom to its top. A light metal ladder ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip through openings in all of the those floors or divisions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and up that ladder now a few of the many-limbed Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunians were hurrying toward the upper compartments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We ourselves were standing, with the Neptunian leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the red circle-insignia, in the lowest or bottom com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment of the cylinder, his four tube-armed guards and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half-dozen green disk-bodied monsters about us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That lowest compartment held great gleaming-cased</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms, from which came the throbbing that we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already heard, and that was so exactly similar to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throb of our space-flier's generators as to remove all</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt but that these were the similar generators of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder. As our eyes roved about them the Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader uttered a staccato command, at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing with one of his seven limbs, up toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder. His meaning was unmistakable, and at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and I stepped toward the ladder and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb upward on it, the tubes of the four watchful guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">just beneath us as they followed. As we passed up that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder, through the upper sections of the cylinder's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior, I saw vaguely the things within those sections.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of them held the dissembled parts of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">cogged mechanisms we had seen them taking down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">storing inside the cylinders. Another two or three sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions held similar dissembled parts of differing machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had evidently been taken from another part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead vast compartment-city beneath. We passed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">through sections that held supplies and strange tank-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs, that seemed not unlike the batteries of our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flier, and then were climbing up into the topmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">section of the cylinder. This was a section whose top</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walls were set with so many windows as to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">its sides seem quite transparent. And this topmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">section, in which a pair of Neptunians already were</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing, was quite apparently the control-scction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For at its center rose from its floor a tluck metal pillar</seg><seg type="columnLine">or standard, upon the top and sides of which were set a</seg><seg type="columnLine">battery of dozens of small green studs, and around this</seg><seg type="columnLine">were strange seats in which the two waiting Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now taking their places. As Marlin and I climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into that uppermost section, the guards and the leader of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disk-bodied Neptunians behind us, we gazed won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deringly about, at the central control-standard and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the srrange graduated scales with moving dots of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them, that were set here and there in the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that seerned recording instruments of one kind or</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. Then the crimson-marked leader liad given</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterance to another sharp succession of snapping sounds,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> swift command, at the same time motioning us to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the circular room, where were similar low, strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats. In these we seated ourselves, the four Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">who watchcd us taking places on either side of us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then as the leader took the remaining seat at the control-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standard, we saw one of the other two seated there reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth with strange quick limbs and touch a number, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the studs in swift succession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At once the . great throbbing of the generators or</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms in the cylinder's lowest section intensified,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as Marlin and I gazed quickly outward through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows about us we saw that now the other cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the compartment were all closed and throbbing- like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this one. Then, as one of the Neptunians at the control-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standard touched another stud, the cylinder in w'hich</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were rose swiftly upward and out of the great black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walled compartment, rose up smoothly over the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment-city into the pale light of the Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, followed at once by the three other cylinders. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim day about us was already waning, fading, as night</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept across this huge world of silence and death, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its ceaseless rotation, but there remained still enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">light for us to see far across the mighty maze of compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments that was the deserted and dead city. And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">across that city the four cylinders were rushing, racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">257</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over It in horizontal position, the strange seats upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we and the Neptunians were seated swinging in</seg><seg type="columnLine">gimbal-like frameworks as the cylinder swung thus from</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertical to horizontal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OVER the huge compartment-city our four cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed, then slowed and halted, as up from another</seg><seg type="columnLine">point in it rose four more cylinders, the four that we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen land in a different part of it, and whose occupants</seg><seg type="columnLine">had discovered and captured us. Then all of the eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">great cylinders, our own in the lead, were rising sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward, tip toward the opening in the vast roof above,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which we had seen them come. As they shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">up toward it. Marlin and I, glancing down and backward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see, even as we had seen from our space-fiier, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast extent of the dead and deserted compartment-city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its mechanisms and huge globes and high black inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">secting walls lying now in such dusty silence and death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet it was only for a moment that we glanced back</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it, for now our eighL cylinders were flashing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the round opening in the huge roof, and out over</seg><seg type="columnLine">that vast roof, seeming solid metal from above, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered all of mighty Neptune. And as wc flashed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, now, I found for the first time opportunity to whisper</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Marlin, beside me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're leaving Neptune!" I whispered. "Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">fcan they be going, Marlin ? And what lias happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whitely and Randall ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lie shook his head, answered in tire same low tones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Whitely and Randall have escaped, I hope. They had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small start on their pursuers--they may have eluded them</seg><seg type="columnLine">here above Neptune-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were abruptly silent as the guards glanced sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piciously toward us with their bulging multiple eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as the great cylinder and those behind shot on, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge metal roof of Neptune below and the vast vapor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of its dense atmosphere stretched above us, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if ever men had found themselves in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position that now was ours. Captured by monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk-bodied beings of horror unutterable, flashing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them above the vast roof that sheathed Neptune and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead, deserted and colossal compartment-city, to a des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tination of which we could not dream! And as that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought passed, another came, and I remembered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great mission that had brought us out here to the terrors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mighty Neptune, our great flight outward to fir.d and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put an end to the huge force-ray that was stabbing across"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solar system and turning the sun ever faster, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every day bringing it nearer to the division that meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom for almost all its universe. What chance was ours</seg><seg type="columnLine">to' accomplish that mission now', separated and captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we were, not knowing even from what source the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ray was issuing, from what strange place these disk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied beings had come and to which they were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was aroused from my silent despair, though, by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">low exclamation from Marlin, and looked up to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinders of which our own was foremost had now</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted, hanging midway between metal roof beneath and</seg><seg type="columnLine">great vapor-masses above. Then down from above I saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping quickly toward us, three other, cylinders similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the eight, three cylinders at sight of which my heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat suddenly faster. For it had been three cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had pursued Whitely and Randall in the space-fiier!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tensely I watched as the three drove down among our</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight, and then one of them had shot suddenly close to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder in which we were, hanging beside it so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">its low door-opening was directly touching the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening of our own. There was a clang of metal beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the doors of both cylinders slid aside. They fitted so</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely against each other that no colder air from without</seg><seg type="columnLine">could enter into the warmed interior of the two cylinders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then from the other were coining into our own cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">three Neptunians who climbed swiftly up into the top-</seg><seg type="columnLine">section in which we were, while Marlin and I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in indescribable suspense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they came up into the uppermost section they</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in their sharp, staccato talk to the Neptunian leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crun-son-circle insignia, making report to him, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was apparent. But it was not to their snapping speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Marlin and T gave our attention, but to the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">they carried in their grip, and which they were showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the leader. Those tilings, I saw with a start of horror,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were some shattered and crumpled plates of metal, great</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat metal plates that I recognized immediately as being</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our space-flierVfaceted sides! And they also held</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broken, twisted metal thing that I recognized in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly as one of the space-Ilier's smaller liquid-oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks! I needed not to understand the strange speech of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Neptunians in that moment to understand what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three were reporting. For those shattered fragments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space-fiier told the tale with terrible clearness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whitely and Randall!" It was Marlin's whisper of</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror beside me. "They were caught by those pursuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders--were annihilated by their rays-!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whitely and Randall-" I felt my voice choke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">then, as I gazed at those last fragments of the space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier's wreckage, mutely testifying to the end which our</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends had met with beneath the shattering rays in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flier somewhere in the cold, vast vapor-masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">above us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whitely--cool and dctachcd and steady, stirred to pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion by nothing save some unprecedented physical phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenon, considering with curious, impersonal eyes each</seg><seg type="columnLine">new peril that had confronted us; and Randall--with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sunny hair and eager young courage and unfailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of fun; it was as though they had risen before me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that moment, when wc saw at last what death had</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtaken them and our space-flier there in the chill</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds of mighty Neptune. T felt Marlin's steadying</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on my shoulder and knew that he was sounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar depths of despair. For with Whitely and Randall</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, with our space-fiier and with ourselves captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held hv these monstrous disk-bodied Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">who yet seemed not of Neptune, our chance to halt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great doom-ray that was radiating toward the sun, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance even lo return to earth with word of. the position</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nature of that ray's source, was gone also!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the despair that had sunken upon me I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware, in a moment, that the throbbing of the cylinder's</seg><seg type="columnLine">great generators had waxed again in intensity. Already</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three Neptunians, who had reported the destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the space-flier, had returned to their own cylinder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had separated from ours, and now the whole eleven</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders, our own in the lead, were racing forward once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, were shooting forward between the great vapor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses above and the vast metal roof below. At im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense and mounting speed they shot forward, a dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of whistling air coming to us from without, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a riioment the pale, dim light about us had begun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change to dnsk, to darkness, as we shot on. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleven cylinders were racing around the surface of Ne.p-</seg><seg type="columnLine">258</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tune toward the side o£ it away from the sun at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, and aS they entered the. shade of that side they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were plunging through the eternal night. But as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders shot on they seemed to need no light or star</seg><seg type="columnLine">to guide them through the deep darkness, though all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was visible was an occasional glinting of the great metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On we shot through that deep darkness and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose in me'a sudden thought that roused me a little from</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlie despair that held Marlin 'and me. Could it be that</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon that other side there still remained a remnant ox</seg><seg type="columnLine">their race? A remnant of the race, that once had built</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mighty compartment-city that covered all Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the vast roof that shielded it, but that now occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a small part of the huge city? Was it from Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune's other side, then, that the giant force-ray had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbed toward the sun? Yet how could that be so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how could that great ray be shot out from any point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune unceasingly as it was, when each twenty hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great planet turned on its axis, when for half of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty hours whatever point that was the ray's source</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be turned away from the sun instead of toward it ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH tense interest Marlin and I gazed ahead into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness through which our cylinders were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing, while at the control-standard the leader and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other two Neptunians manipulated the force-rays that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were propelling onward the cylinder in which we were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last, after some minutes of this rushing flight of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense velocity, the cylinders seemed to slow down, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause. Looking out I could discern the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic metal roof below us, just showing itself to us</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a little glint of light here and there from it, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment Marlin and I waited in suspense for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders to sink down toward and through it, to what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever place upon Neptune's other side it was that held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remainder of their strange races, since by then, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, wc were at that side of Neptune almost exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite tlie sun. Only a moment the cylinders slowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and paused, and then were leaping through the air again</seg><seg type="columnLine">at mounting speed. But instead of flashing downward-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the great roof, they were flashing upward!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upward they were shooting, up through the dense air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and straight into die great vapor-masses that loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">above us! Through those great clouds they were racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, driving upward through them as through a darker</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, and then suddenly had shot up and out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, up and out into the clear raid thinner air of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune's atmosphere's outermost limits. Behind our</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders thus lay the huge, vapor-wreathed planet, shut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting out by its vast bulk all sight of the sun's distant little</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk of fire, or of the greater planets. But before us</seg><seg type="columnLine">there stretched once more the black vault of space, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folding itself to our eyes for the first time since we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventured down through those, shrouding vapors to Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune's surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brightest in that black void there shone, before and</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat above us, Triton, the moon of Neptune. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost white in color, tinged with the pale green of</seg><seg type="columnLine">great Neptune, about which it moved, and seeming of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same size to our eyes as earth's own moon. Beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all about it, though, there flamed the great stars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming the same to our eyes here at the solar system's</seg><seg type="columnLine">outermost limits as they had seemed to us when far</seg><seg type="columnLine">within it, at earth. The great field of stars and slar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusters that was Sagittarius,- straight ahead and upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the irregular parallelogram of Capricorn's stars, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loft, the throbbing crimson heart and jeweled menacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">claws of Scorpio, to the right--all seemed to our eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they had seemed when we had started--how long ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed!--out from earth toward great Neptune, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay now behind us. Yet now, with Neptune' behind us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our eleven cylinders were flashing forward with greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">and greater speed, were Hashing out apparently from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system's last outpost into the vast void of inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar space!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're going on--going out from Neptune into outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">space!" i exclaimed to Marlin, as we gazed ahead, trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But suddenly lie shook his head, pointing ahead aiid</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward, for now the cylinders were flashing upward as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as forward. "It's Triton they're heading toward!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. '''Triton--Neptune's single moon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Triton!" I exclaimed, thunderstruck with amazement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then--then--it must be on Triton that the remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians now are!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Triton! For it was up toward it, up toward the white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">green-tinged moon of Neptune that shone. dully in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black vault above and ahead of us, that the eleven cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, our own in the lead, were heading! And as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot out of the last limits of the atmosphere of Neptune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they flashed forward at swiftly mounting speed still</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the moon, I could but stare at it in amazement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton! It was from it, then, that there had come these</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange disk-bodied Neptunians who had captured us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had annihilated our space-flier and our friends. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on Triton, then, that there must remain whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians still were left of those who had built the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartmcnt-city that eovcred all the surface of Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, who had shielded it with that gigantic floating roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">that enclosed all the mighty planet. Yet why had they</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted their vast compartment-city, their great world</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Neptune ? Why had they left that world for the single</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon of Neptune, so much smaller in size? And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant force-ray that was shooting across space to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, turning it ever faster, was it from Neptune then or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton that that colossal ray was radiating?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to me that these questions were spinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my head in a kaleidoscopic whirl of enigmas, as our</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing cylinder and the ten behind it shot on and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward at a great slant toward the dull-gleaming sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Triton. Marlin, beside me, was staring ahead ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously as much mystified as I was, while the four .Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunians ranged on either side of us kept their ceaseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch upon us. The other three sat still at the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">control-standard, directing the cylinder 011 its rush out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Neptune, toward its moon. And now, that moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew larger ahead of us and above us, a strangely-gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sphere that seemed still very small, in comparison</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the huge pale green disk of mighty Neptune that</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed behind us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew, though, that Triton was of the same approx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imate size as earth's own moon, and revolved around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great planet at the same approximate distance as earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">own moon, roughly a quarter of a million miles. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had noted from our space-flicr in flashing out toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune, its moon was now behind the great planet, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is on the other side of it from the sun, but due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp inclination of the- plane of Triton's orbit around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune, it was so much higher than its great planet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space as to make it possible to see the single moon, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Neptune's sunward side.

Triton's dull-gleaming sphere filled the heavens</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us. Behind and a little below the great green</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk of Neptune, belted with the vast cloud-masses of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense atmosphere, loomed almost as great as ever to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our eyes. And far beyond it there burned the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright little disk, just above the huge sphere of Neptune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and visible to us through the thinner vapors of Neptune's</seg><seg type="columnLine">uppermost atmosphere. We turned back toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer world of Triton. As the cylinders rushed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it, all the suspense of expectation and mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been ours since our first arrival at the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead world of Neptune gripped us now with renewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. And as Marlin and I stared ahead we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that the cylinders were dropping, swinging about</seg><seg type="columnLine">our pivoted seats and dropping toward the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton that seemed now to gleam beneath us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward it we smoothly shot, and as Marlin and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed intently down we saw that there were below</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of the great cloud-masses that wreathed the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mighty Neptune. Instead was only a smooth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely gleaming surface that we could but vaguely</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse, and the sight of which made my beart pound</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sudden anticipation. Could the thing lie--could it be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that here upon Triton as upon Neptune-? But my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering speculations were cut abruptly short by reality</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we shot lower toward tlie surface of Triton, as that</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface came clearly at last to the eyes of Marlin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, bringing involuntary exclamations of amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us. For that surface was metal! Triton was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shielded on all sides by a giant metal roof similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which enclosed great Neptune itself!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DOWN toward that mighty roof our eleven cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rushing. When they seemed just above it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they halted their drop and raced along above it, around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton's vastly curving surface. As they did so, Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I, gazing downward, saw that the vast roof that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shielded Triton appeared to be, from above, of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark metal as that which protected Neptune, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it extended away without break or seam as far as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see over the big moon's surface. And as our</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders flashed above it, around the world's surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were aware that Triton had an atmosphere even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">had its great parent world, since from outside was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dull roar of air against the speeding cylinder. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fact startling enough, but at that moment it was driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our minds by a thing more startling still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For as we flashed thus around Triton's sunward side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin suddenly uttered a hoarse exclamation, pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead and to the left. I gazed in that direction instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for a moment saw nothing unusual, but then as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders flashed on I saw that in that direction was what</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a great round opening in the smooth, dark metal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a titanic circular opening that must be miles across. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of that opening was rising what seemed at first glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vast cylinder of pale light that sprang straight up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward from the gigantic opening, and that was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible for a short distance above that opening, fading</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly into invisibility as it shot out into the gulf of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">space from Triton. Instinctively my eyes followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fading length of that mighty beam outward, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they did so I felt sudden, awed understanding de-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">scending upon me and stared with Marlin toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant pit and its great ray in stunned silence. For that</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant ray was pointing straight into the great gulf of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, toward the tiny, fiery disk of the distant sun!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The giant force-ray!" Marlin whispered. "The great</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray that's turning the sun ever faster--and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we came out here to find!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And pointing straight toward the sun!" I exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pointing through Neptune's upper atmosphere toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For we could see now that,the giant ray, visible only</seg><seg type="columnLine">there at its source, must indeed be cleaving through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper limits of great Neptune's atmosphere as it reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the great gulf toward the sun. For since Triton</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the other side of Neptune from the sun, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its outward side, the great green sphere of Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay almost between the sun and Triton, the big moon being</seg><seg type="columnLine">high enough above the great planet, though, due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclination of its orbital plane, to make the sun visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it through the upper readies of Neptune's vast atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere. Through that atmosphere, therefore, we knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant force-ray must be driving on its path across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solar system toward the sun, hurtling across the gulf</seg><seg type="columnLine">to strike against that spinning sun's edge with terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure and to spin it ever faster toward that day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">division and doom that wras mardiing relentlessly upon it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as our cylinders now swept nearer toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant force-ray and the pit from w'hich it stabbed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and outward, Marlin and I were staring obliquely down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into that vast pit. Seen from the side as we saw it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tremendous opening seemed only like a mighty well</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal, from which the colossal pale force-ray, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as great in diameter as the huge pit, stabbed. We could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, however, that set near the great pit's top at regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals around its curving wall were what seemed metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">cube-like rooms, which were set on the pit's smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">curving wall. They were a score in number, those out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jutting metal cubes, and from slits in their walls came</seg><seg type="columnLine">light from within, and glimpses of stud-covered walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Neptimians moving about them. We knew, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt, that those twenty cubes held within them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unthinkably complex controls of this mighty force-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was destroying the solar system!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now our cylinder and the ten that drove close</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind it were passing the vast pit, the huge force-ray.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I noted that they took extreme care to pass pit and mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray at a respectable distance, and knew, too, the reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it, knew that any luckless cylinder that blundered into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that colossal out-stabbing ray would be driven instantly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific speed and force out through the solar system and</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sun that the ray was striking! So that it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not surprise us that the cylinders veered far to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the huge ray, picking up speed once more when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had passed it, and racing on around Triton's metal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shielded surface and through the cold, dense atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside it. But as the cylinders drove on the eyes of Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin and myself now were turned backward, back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gigantic pale ray of awful force that shot ceaselessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and out from that vast pit in Triton's metal side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've found it--the great ray we came out here to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find--the source of that ray," I exclaimed to Marlin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but we've found it too late! Whitely and Randall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space-flier annihilated--we captured-"</seg><seg type="columnLine">260</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bent toward me. "Keep your courage up, Hunt,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "We may have a chance yet to get free--to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from this world of Triton before they take us down</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what--?" I began, when with a gesture he cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">me short. "No more now, Hunt--the guards are watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. But be ready to act if a chance shows itself, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">once down in Triton, we'll probably have no chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw that the four disk-bodied Neptunians who sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us and guarded us were indeed watching us closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">now with their strange bulging eyes, so gave over for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment our whispered conversation, though with a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of hope. Glancing back again toward the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray that was almost invisible behind us as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleven cylinders raced on around Triton's metal surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was aware that Marlin was staring back toward it also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently, shaking his head a little, as though puzzled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">something concerning that giant beam of force. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he turned his attention ahead. Our cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">now were flashing around Triton from its sunward side</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its dark side, and as we rushed on Marlin and I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that to all appearances Triton was not rotating, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least not above a low rate of speed. Then as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered into the deeper shadow of the dark side, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's little disk vanishing behind us as we shot around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton's curving surface into the shadow, Marlin uttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low exclamation once more, and as I turned to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same direction I saw that far ahead there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbing out and upward into the black void of outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">space a second giant force-ray like that one we had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready seen shooting toward the sun!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Stupefied, I gazed toward it. For the first giant force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray, amazing as it was, had yet been expected by us, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less, since we had known from the first that such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal force-beam was stabbing from the region of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune toward the sun. But this second mighty force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray, which seemed exactly the same in size and appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance and which rose from a giant pit or well in the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal roof even as did the first, was not directed toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun. For it was on the other side of Triton from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first ray, was exactly half around Triton from the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was going out into space in an exactly opposite di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection ! Thus while the first colossal force-ray, springing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from Triton's sunward side, shot straight toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, this second huge force-ray, on Triton's dark or outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, was radiating straight out into the vast void of</seg><seg type="columnLine">interstellar space, was radiating straight out, to all ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearances, toward the unthinkably distant stars of Sag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ittarius that burned in that mighty void!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  What could be the meaning of this other colossal force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray, of equal size and power, going out into the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">void outside the solar system ? The first great ray that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shooting toward the sun and turning the sun ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster--its purpose was at least comprehensible, but what</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose could there be in sending an opposite and equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray out into the mighty void from Triton's other side?</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was the question that whirled in my astounded brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that moment as the eleven cylinders shot on toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">that second great ray, over Triton's metal surface. Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin, though, on seeing that second great ray, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be less puzzled than before. It seemed to have solved</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him some problem which the sight of the first huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray had suggested. To me it was utterly incompre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensible, and perplexed and awed I watched that huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale ray and the vast pit from which it sprang as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced toward them. I saw that on that pit's curving walls</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there jutted forth a score of cube-like projections or</seg><seg type="columnLine">control-rooms similar to those in the pit of the first ray.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I forgot pit and rays alike as the cylinder in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were and all those behind it slowed suddenly in mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and then dipped sharply downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DOWN and down they shot, toward the vast gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing metal roof of great Triton; down, until we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that just beneath us there was outlined in that roof a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great circle, slightly sunken. Toward this the cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped, and then as they came to a pause just above it</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that set beside that circle in the roof was a trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent section beneath which was a small cage-like room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly lit. In this were a half-dozen Neptunians, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they saw the eleven cylinders dropping and pausing</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the circle in the roof they turned swiftly, pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">what seemed a series of knobs in their cage-room, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once the great sunken circle beneath us was sliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">along beneath the roof to one side, sliding smoothly away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaving thus beneath us a great circular opening in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly up from that opening around our cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rushing a torrent of air, a torrent of uprushing air</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I understod well was caused by the wanner air</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the roof rushing up into the colder outside at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere. But now down through that opening and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air-currents the cylinders were swiftly drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping, and we could see far below in dim light a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment-city like the one we had found upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune! In a moment more we would be below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof, the opening closed above us, prisoned hopelessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Triton to meet whatever fate our captors decreed. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready two of our four guards, and two of the Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the control-standard, had left the cylinder's upmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">section and had clambered down the ladder to the lowest</seg><seg type="columnLine">section in preparation for emerging. There was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us in the upmost section of the cylinder only two</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards and the Neptunian leader of the crimson-circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">insignia at the control standard. And as I saw that, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was leaning quietly toward Marlin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now's our chance. Marlin!" I whispered tensely. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">wc could overpower these three Neptunians and the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath afterward we might yet get back to earth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced calmly around, then nodded. "We'll take</seg><seg type="columnLine">it!" he whispered. "Once beneath this roof of Triton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there'll be no chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go for the guard beside you, then, when I cough as</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal," I told him. "If we can dispose of them and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader there we can hold the rest below for a time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He met my eyes with his own, then turned and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though merely shifting a little in his seat moved nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the guard on his side. I had already done the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same toward the disk-bodied monster beside myself, both</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards having slightly relaxed their first watchfulness. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced out, saw that even at that moment our cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sinking with the otiiers toward the great opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the roof and knew that no moment was to be lost. So,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with heart beating rapidly now, even as our cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared to sink down through the opening with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest, I coughed slightly. In the next moment I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung myself with a single motion upon the Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard beside me and had seen Marlin in the same instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing himself on the monster at his own side!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moment following was of such swift action as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">defy the memory. In my leap upon the Neptunian beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">me it had been my first object to knock his tube from</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">261</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his grasp before he could loose its rays upon me, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift and sudden was my attack that I did so, as did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin with the other guard. With the same motion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as the guard's seven great limbs reached toward me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had grasped his big disk-body and then with a super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human effort had raised it in my arms and had cast him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from me, down through the opening in the section's floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">to crumple against the floor of one of the sections</seg><seg type="columnLine">below! I whirled, saw that the other guard had gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and was bearing him down, and then even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came from beneath and from the Neptunian leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the controls sLaccato cries of alarm, I had gripped that</seg><seg type="columnLine">other guard likewise and hurled him across the cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">to strike with stunning force against its wall! Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and I were whirling toward the Neptunian leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the control-standard, but in the moment that we turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him we stopped short. For that Neptunian had</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped aside from the controls of the cylinder and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly drawn his own ray-tube!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VITT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Prisoned on Triton</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOTHING, T know now, of our own doing could</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever have saved us from the death that in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment loomed dark and close above us. For,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Neptunian leader raised the tube toward us, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that before ever a leap could Lake us across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder to him, the pencil-like rays of force from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube would be tearing through us. For that split-second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, escape seemed impossible, and then before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could fully realize the situation there came an interrup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. The currents of warmer air from the opening just</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath, down through which the cylinder had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping with the others, were sweeping still upward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">great force around the cylinder. Only the Neptunian's</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp on the controls had kept the cylinder heading down</seg><seg type="columnLine">through those currents, and now, as he leaped away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the controls for the moment and drew his tube, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents immediately seized upon the unguidcd cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the next moment had whirled it over and sidewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">with immense speed and power! And as it whirled thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, Marlin and myself and the Neptunian before us</seg><seg type="columnLine">were thrown instantly and indiscriminately to the cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der's side!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment we rolled helplesly about the whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder's interior, about the upmost section, and in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment all thought of battle had left us. Then, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt Marlin and the Neptunian leader and the stunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard rolling with me indiscriminately, I was aware, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cries from the cylinder's other sections and of Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunians drawing themselves up to the upmost section on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ladder. Abruptly, in a moment more the cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadied, hung poised and upright as before, and then as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and I scrambled to our feet we saw that a trio</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Neptunians beneath had made their way up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upmost section, despite the cylinder's whirling, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of Lheir multiple limbs, and that while one now</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the controls the other two had their tubes trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, more full upon us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our wild attempt at escape had failed, it was evident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for now, as the Neptunian leader of the crimson circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose, he was addressing to the others a sharp, snapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">order, and at the same time motioning Marlin and me</seg><seg type="columnLine">peremptorily to the seats we had formerly occupied. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">took them with no further resistance, for we knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">our desperate outbreak had put the Neptunians upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard and that the slightest suspicious motion on our part</seg><seg type="columnLine">might well mean instant death. And as we seated our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves once more with the guards on either side, one from</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath replacing the one I had killed, the despair that</seg><seg type="columnLine">formerly had filled us seemed immeasurably intensified.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For now the cylinder was sinking down after the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the great opening in Triton's roof, and even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and I looked outward we saw the great opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that roof closing again above us with a clang that to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our ears was like the clang of doom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above our sinking cylinders now there stretched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great roof, and, even as Neptune's enclosing roof, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was almost entirely transparent from below, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">opaque from above. And here as on Neptune we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see no supporting pillars whatever for this vast spherical</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof tliat enclosed all Triton. This world seemed, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, but a smaller replica of mighty Neptune. For, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">our cylinders sank down through the shadows of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker side and then leveled out and began to race</seg><seg type="columnLine">back around its curving surface toward the sunward side</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more, we saw that all of Triton's surface was cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, even like Neptune, with a great compartment-city</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose intersecting black walls stretched in their vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">checkerboard arrangement over all the great moon's sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. But as our cylinders shot over these, over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened portion of the surface of Triton and toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunward side, we saw that the compartment city beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">was different, in some features, from that of Neptune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one thing, there were moving to and fro above</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a number of great cylinders like that in which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, and in the compartments of the darkened side</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, too, a few Neptunians here and there. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great globes of metal that dotted this compartment-city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Triton, even as that of Neptune, were here glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with radiant light; glowing, I knew, with radiant heat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For this was the secret of the Neptunians' existence on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton, this heat that glowed from the numberless giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes set in compartments here and there. Those great</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing globes kept the air beneath Triton's great roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm and comfortable, the great roof itself preventing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that warmer air from escaping into the moon's colder</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer atmosphere. As we.shot on over the darkened</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Triton, the side turned away from the sun, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not but think that the remnants of the Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">race must be few indeed, so few of them moved in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy compartments beneath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, as Marlin and I gazed ahead, we could make</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a brighter crescent of light at the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange moon-world, and as we shot on wc saw that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were approaching the edge of the sunward or sunlit side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A moment more and we could see it clearly and as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so Marlin and I gasped in utter amazement. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">that part of the great compartment-city that lay on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton's sunward side, in the pale sunlight, was swarm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with incalculable millions upon tens of millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians! Crowding, seething, pressing together, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pouring to and fro through the compartments in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pale light of day, busy with the mechanisms that</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcc had room in those compartments, so great were</seg><seg type="columnLine">their crowds! And over this sunward side hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon hundreds of cylinders swarmed, rushing to and fro!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neptunians! Neptunians in countless millions here</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sunward side of Triton! But why then are there</seg><seg type="columnLine">so few upon the dark side ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">262</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin shook his head at my exclamation. "I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess," he said. "And I never dreamed that-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before he could finish tlie sentence there came an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing interruption from beneath. As we gazed down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward from our speeding cylinder we saw a giant band of</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensely brilliant white light spring suddenly into being</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the very line that marked where dark side and sunlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Triton met. A mile in width, that great brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of light seemed to extend clear from Triton's north</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole to its south, as far north and south of us as our</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes could reach. And then, even as we stared, astounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it, that brilliant aud immense band of light was moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Triton's surface over the dark side! Swiftly it</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, like a great wave of brilliant light sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Triton's surface, and in a moment had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared from view far around the horizon from us on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark side!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as that dazzling light-band moved around the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon-world's dark side, around the almost empty com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment-city that covercd that dark side, we saw emerg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into that compartmentscity of the dark side, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its walls themselves, millions on millions of disk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied Neptunians that matched in number the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarms 011 the sunlit side! And as we gazed down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter amazement we saw from whence they came. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the dark compartmcnt-city's extent many com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partments like those we had seen upon Neptune, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing in them save shelving, which formed in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls myriads of shelfed openings a few feet in height</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some four feet in width, one above the other. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in these narrow, flat shelf-openings countless Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been sleeping! Their disk-bodies, with the flexible</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs drawn up, fitted snugly into those flat, strange open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings in the walls, and vast hordes of them, countless mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions of them, had been sleeping in the shelf-compay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments on Triton's dark side!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As that band of brilliant light swept swiftly across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark sides though, they had awakened, were pouring forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all their hordes into and through the compartments, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaming toward the sunward side, while the more remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them were heading toward the same side in flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders above. Then, as we gazed toward that sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward side, we saw the brilliant band of light reappearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, moving swiftly still around Triton's surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the pale dim light of its sunward side, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those moments moved completely around Triton! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved on until in a moment more it had stopped where</seg><seg type="columnLine">first it had formed, at the junction of the dark and sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward sides. There it hung for a moment, dazzling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then had suddenly snapped out of being. And now we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that all the crowding millions of Neptunians that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been busy upon the sunlit side were streaming through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compartments toward the dark side!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Neptunians' day and night!" Marlin exclaimed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we gazed downward. "Triton must keep one face</seg><seg type="columnLine">always toward the sun and one dark, so these Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend their day on the sunlit side and sleep their night 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark side I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that great band of light that traveled around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton was their signal, then!" I added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was plain now that that was the astounding truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These countless millions of Neptunians, coming here</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Triton for some reason, had been accustomed upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own great turning planet to a day and night of ten hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">each, much like those of earth. Triton, though, as we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had already guessed, kept the same face always toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun, it was evident, turning at just such a rate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotation as compensated for its revolutions around Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune and its slower movements with Neptune around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. Thus, with one face always toward the sun and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other always in darkness, the Neptunians had been forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to establish arbitrary day and night periods, dividing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their millions into two great bodies, apparently. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of them worked on the sunlit side for ten hours, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their day, the other half were sleeping upon the dark side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, when the ten hours ended, the great band of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">went around Triton as a signal, and the two bodies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them changed places, the millions who had worked upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunward side taking their places for an equal period</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sleep on the dark side, while those who had slept 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark side streamed to the sunlit side for ten hours!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as we watched from our speeding Cylinder we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that great change taking place, millions upon millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Neptunians streaming from one side to the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">in great throngs through the compartment-city, while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from farther around Triton's two sides, rushed countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders, in which hosts of others were changing sides.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within a few minutes, it seemed, that change had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, and beneath us on Triton's sunward side there</seg><seg type="columnLine">thronged in the pale light of its day tlie vast hordes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">so lately had been sleeping, while on the dark side the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other masses of the Neptunians had disappeared into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">countlcss shelf-like openings of the sleep-compartments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lie in sleep for another ten hours. In marveling won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der Marlin and I stared, and then woke suddenly to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization of our own position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beneath us there lay the very edge or dividing line</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the dark and sunlit sides, a belt of twilight dusk</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was very narrow. Squarely across that belt, we saw',</seg><seg type="columnLine">there lay beneath us a great compartment that was largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">by far of all that we had yet seen, and that was unique</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them in that, instead of being rectangular, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular in shape. Down, over and past this mighty cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular compartment our cylinders were speeding, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could but vaguely note some circular object inside it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we were past it, were speeding low over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thronged and busy compartments of the sunward side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rapidly the speed of the cylinders decreased, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had paused in mid-air, were beginning to descend.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in a moment more they had come smoothly to rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a great rectangular compartment which seemed re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served as a landing-place, since on it there rested scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of other cylinders, others constantly arriving or depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Later we were tojearn that these landing-compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were scattered in large number over Triton's sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, on the sunlit and dark sides both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the present moment, though, Marlin and I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing only at our immediate surroundings. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed the guards on either side of us gripped us tightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others keeping their tubes pointed toward us,and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the throbbing of the cylinder's generators ceased, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunian leader of the crimson circle insignia uttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a staccato order. At once our guards were thrusting us</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the ladder that led downward, and, holding us</seg><seg type="columnLine">above and beneath, were descending that ladder with tis</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cylinder's lowest compartment. There the Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunian leader followed us in a moment, and as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder's door was slid open a flood of warm, heavy air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a babel of sound from about us rolled inside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before emerging, though, the Neptunians performed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">action that for the moment puzzled me completely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">263</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was to take from the cabinets in the cylinder's</seg><seg type="columnLine">side a number of small metal objects that seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">disks of gray metal a few inches across with flexible</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal straps attached to them. These the Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to the bottom or ends of their round, short</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs, as though little round sandals of metal. Then at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the order of their leader they took other disks and at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached them to the feet of Marlin and myself, one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">each foot, binding them to our soles by passing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flexible straps up around our ankles. The thing was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzling to Marlin as to myself, for the moment, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">could we understand its object until, a moment later, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians began to pass out of the cylinder to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paving of the compartment outside. For as they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so 1 had reached toward one of the unused disks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">examine it and had uttered an exclamation to find that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though so small in size and thickness, it was of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds weight! Yet as Marlin and I, in answer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader's order and gesture, passed out of the cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the landing-compartment's floor, we could not feel at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that weight of dozens of pounds which had been fas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened to our feet!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly, though, light came to my perplexed mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Triton!" I exclaimed. "It's of about the same size as</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's moon and hasn't much more gravitational power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And these Neptunians, used to the far greater gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional power of Neptune, have to use these weights to</seg><seg type="columnLine">add to their weight here on Triton to make it possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them to move as always!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin's eyes widened, and then he nodded. "It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be so," he said. "I wondered when I saw them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">above how these .creatures of Neptune could move so</seg><seg type="columnLine">freely on its smaller moon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was, indeed, a simple, yet ingenious device which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Neptunians had adopted. Accustomed as they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been to the great gravitational power of Neptune, seven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen times that of earth, their squat, strange bodies owing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their form to that great gravitational power, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles would have sent them through the air of Triton</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill immense and uncontrollable leaps at each step, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much smaller was the moon-world's gravitational power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So they bad devised these small disks which fitted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of their strange limbs, and which, though so small</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thin, yet had great weight, 110 doubt because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms of their substance had been compressed closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">together for the purpose. The. Neptunians had used</seg><seg type="columnLine">disks of some thickness for themselves, and had used</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinner ones for Marlin and myself, their smaller weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">just sufficing to counteract the difference in gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional power between earth and Triton. And now', as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stepped out into the landing-compartment with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, it seemed as though we were walking with lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighted shoes at the ocean's bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The landing-compartment about us held scores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting cylinders like our own, and even as we looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about we saw throngs of Neptunians hastening forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and removing from our own and the other ten that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just landed, the disassembled mechanisms which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought from Neptune. The leader, however, mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned to our guards to follow with us, and set off quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the landing-compartment toward one of its doors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Following him, our four tube-armed guards watchful</seg><seg type="columnLine">now about us, we saw him pass through the low, broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">door before us, and though his strange disk-body passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily through that door, Marlin and I were forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoop low to get through it. Then, our guards never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">relaxing their cautious watch over us, we were moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">on through the next compartment, and the next, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next, on through compartment after compartment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all thronging with Neptunians, moving across Lhe great</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment-city toward the twilight band that divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton's dark and sunlit sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as Marlin and I moved with our guards and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their leader thus through the pale daylight of Triton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the compartments crowded with masses upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of Neptunians, we forgot almost the uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate that hung over us, in the interest and wonder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we saw. For though we had explored the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment-city that covered all the surface of mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune, had seen its marvels also, it had been a city</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead, a city of lifeless and unused mechanisms whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes we had not been able to guess. But here on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton, in the compartments that covered its surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw a Neptunian city bursting with crowding life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw it as the giant city of Neptune itself must once have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, before some unguessed purpose of the Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought them here to Triton. And, seeing it thus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were able to comprehend many things that had puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled us in our venture through the city on Neptune's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifeless surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE passed through compartments in which throngs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Neptunians moved about great rows of loom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, pear-shaped mechanisms such as we had seen on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune, great water-making mechanisms that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating here with a slow, rhythmic sound of pcwer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which there pulsed into the great connecting pipes</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ceaseless gush of water. That water, we knew, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made synthetically in the mechanisms by the combination</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, but whether those atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were derived, as on Neptune, from the break-down of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune's great vapor-masses, or whether they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed themselves from the primal electricity, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not guess. Through many compartments of these we</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, and through other compartments that held great</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumps that evidently forced the water supplies thus man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ufactured to every part of Triton's surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And we went through compartments, too, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were other great objects Lhat had puzzled us so com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely on Neptune, but whose purpose we saw now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These were the great flat metal containers stackcd one</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the other, each a foot- or so in depth, and each</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with black, green-shot soil. About them, as on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune, were set in the walls great white disks con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected to generating apparatus of some kind, but here</seg><seg type="columnLine">those generating mechanisms were humming with power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended by many Neptunians, and there shot from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disks, over and through those great containers of soil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ceaseless flood of pale violet light or force. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as we passed through those compartments, we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange and stocky pale-green plants bursting up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soil of the containers, growing at incredible speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before our eyes, attaining a height of inches in but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute or so! As these strange pale-green plants reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a height of a foot or so, there formed upon them masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fruits or vegetables dead white in color, some being</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and pod-like and others ball-shaped. And as these</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed, the attendant Neptunians were swiftly turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing off the violet force, pulling the fruit-laden little plants</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the fine soil, and depositing them in low-wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">containers, which were wheeled instantly away. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the framework that held the great soil-containers</seg><seg type="columnLine">264</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there sprayed out upon them fine whitish-green particles</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I recognized as seed of some sort, that fell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soil and then were turned under it as some reversing</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism turned over the soil in each container. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the violet force from the wall-disks was turned on again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a moment another crop of pale-green plants was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting up out of the containers!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was then that I saw tlie astounding purpose of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectors of violet force that were set in the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the soil-containers. For it was evident that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot forth upon the containers a force or vibration which</seg><seg type="columnLine">held in it the ultra-violet and other radiations which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sunlight stimulate the growth of plant-life. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations were projected artificially through the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainers of soil with immeasurably greater intensity than</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sunlight, and so stimulated the growth of plant-life</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those containers immeasurably more. Also I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that tubes ran from the framework through the soil</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the containers, flooding that soil with moisture, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that water used thus came through special cubical</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks and mixers, it was apparent that it was impreg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated with the chemical elements needed by the plant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">life in its swift, astounding growth. Thus, stimulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an intense degree by those influences, the plant-life</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those containers could germinate and shoot up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripen with unbelievable speed. When it was removed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the containers were ready at once for another crop. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole ojieration was swift and almost automatic, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we saw great masses of the white fruits or vegetables</seg><seg type="columnLine">being wheeled away from the plant-compartments, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized at last how the Neptunians. in their great com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parunent-cities, obtained a ceaseless and inexhaustible</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and water'supply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we passed on, marveling, we saw other great</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms at work. Some were huge and cogged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">operated by seated Neptunians before them, turning out</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceaselcss great blocks of smooth, black stone-like material</seg><seg type="columnLine">that composed the intersecting compartment-walls, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured out as a thick liquid and hardened in molds into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that diamond-hard substance. Others were strange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearing machines like none we had seen on Neptune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose purpose we could not guess. Here and there there</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed in its square compartment one of the great heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiating globes, sending currents of intensely warm air</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing out from about it, all the mechanisms of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes seeming to be cased inside themselves. Yet even</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things were no more wonderful to us than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throngs of Neptunians that swirled and pressed in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions in the great compartment-city about us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Numberless, indeed, were the hordes of those Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunians, their masses swarming about us in great crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disk-bodied, pale-green monsters, busy upon the clank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, beating, hissing mechanisms around them, busy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">providing tlie heat and food and water of their strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. It seemed impossible, almost, that so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless millions of them could thus have crowded to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether on Triton's surface. All wore the strange armor</seg><seg type="columnLine">or dress of flexible metal around their disk-bodies, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying ray-tubcs slung in that armor and others vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous tools or instruments. Here and there we saw one</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the same crimson-circle insignia as our leader's</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his metal armor, and it was apparent from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent deference shown these circle-marked Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were officials of some kind. As we marched</seg><seg type="columnLine">on behind our leader, our guards close about us, we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, despite our strange appearance to them, the Nep-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tunians paid no great attention to us--so busy were they.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We saw, too, that here on Triton's sunward side there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no shelf-like sleep-comparfments at all, all such</seg><seg type="columnLine">being upon the dark side. In silent awe and wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and I moved on through the thronging compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, countless Neptunians crowding busily all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and coundess cylinders throbbing through the aif</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, with the vast roof far above them. Then 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensed that we were approaching our destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For before us now, as we crossed a last compartment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there lay that twilight band of dusk which marked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">division of Triton's dark and sunlit sidess and as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed out of the pale, dim light of the sunlit side into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twilight of that band, we saw that before us lay a</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment wall that was curving instead of straight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of the great single circular compartment we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had noticed from above. The compartment that lay be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween us and that wall was empty save for a file of Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunian guards who stood motionless along the curving</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall with their force-ray tubes ready in their grasp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As our leader reached them he halted, spoke with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment in staccato speech, and then as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping voices ceased the guards stood aside to right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left and permitted us to pass through the low, broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">door in that curving wall. Through it we went, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle-marked leader first and then Marlin and I, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">four guards still close about us, and then as we halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside that door, we two were gazing- with a deepened</seg><seg type="columnLine">awe and wonder about us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were standing just at tlie edge oi that great cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular compartment that we had glimpsed from above,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundreds of feet in diameter, the twilight about it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispelled somewhat in it by soft-glowing disks in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. In this great compartment there stood what</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed an immense circular table of metal, only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in height, ring-like in form and with a clear circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">space at its center. This great ring-table's edge was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a dozen or so feet from the compartment's</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular wall, and ranged around it, on low scats between</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlie ring-like table and tlie wall, were thirty disk-bodied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians. Silent and almost motionless they sat there</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the-great ring-table, and I saw that upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal armor of each was a crimson circle like that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our leader, except that there was a crimson dot at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">centcr, a symbol we had noted 011 110 other Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far. And from each of the thirty there ran in</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the clear space at the ring-table's center a slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">black wire-connection, attached by tliverging connections</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the body of each of the thirty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These thirty connections ended at the space at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring-table's center, running there into a strange object</seg><seg type="columnLine">or mechanism that stood in that space. It was composed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a great metal pedestal with straight sides, like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">upright pillar, into which the thirty connections ran,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while upon the pillar's top was supported a globe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal somewhat greater in diameter than the pillar, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">some five feet across. Ill this globe's side was a round</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, while set at two other points at opposite sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it were what seemed inset diaphragms. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supported globe came a fine hum, scarcely audible, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was the only sound in the great compartment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole scenc was strange--the towering black walls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great circular compartment about us, the great ring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table in it and the thirty silent, motionless disk-bodied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians seated around that table, and the giant globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its pedestal at tlie table's central space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">265</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS we stood there the Neptunian leader before us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. spoke in sharp snaps, as though explaining our</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence, but not to the thirty around the table; it spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the great central globe of inetal! In amazement we</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him, and then we saw that the globe was turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon its pedestal, turning toward us a small circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of clear glass set in its opposite side, that surveyed 113</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the moment exactly like a single calm eye. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the globe turned again, the opening in its side again</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing us, and then from that opening came a staccato</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to our leader, a swift question, apparently, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping speech-sounds of the Neptunians! The globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hearing our captor's report, was questioning him</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning that report, while the thirty around the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered no sound, and turned not toward us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God!" I muttered at that astounding spectacle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That globe of metal, Marlin--it hears him, answers</seg><seg type="columnLine">him! The thing must be alive!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not alive, Hunt/' Marlin said swiftly, his own eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled, though. "Those connections that run from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty to the globe--they center in that globe's mecha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nism in some way the minds, the intelligence, of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Swift light flashed upon me at Marlin's words, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gazed astonished toward the thirty Neptunians and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">central globe I knew that Marlin's explanation was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only logical one. These thirty Neptunians, it was ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent, were the supreme rulers, the highest council,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the Neptunian race. And since it was neccssary</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they use all of their differing minds as one in di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">recting the destinies of their strange race, they had in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some way devised a mechanism for that purpose, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">synthesized the intelligence, the minds, of the thirty into</seg><seg type="columnLine">one single mind by means of that strange mechanism.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So that it was literally as one mind that the thirty per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived and thought, when gathered here together, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">central globe speaking out the synthesized thoughts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions of all the thirty!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Marlin and I stared in amazement towrard it, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader was answering to the globe's questions concerning</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, the snapping speech of the Neptunian indistinguish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able from that of the mechanism. Then when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished, the globe was speaking briefly to him again, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short order, and in answer to that order the Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader turned at once toward us. I think that both Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin and myself would not have been surprised to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the death that we knew hung over us, but, instead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leader gestured to us and to our guards and led the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way out of the great circular Council Compartment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a different door from that by which we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered. As we passed through that door I glanced back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw the thirty Neptunians of the great Council still</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting motionless and silent around their weird globe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism, which was listening now to the report of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three other Neptunians who had entered behind us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Once out of the. great circular compartment, wc found</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves with our guards in an irregular-shaped com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment, filled with Neptunian guards who parted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">allow 11s to pass. Through that and through another</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectangular compartment we went, and then into a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblong compartment in which we could see, despite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight that reigned here, were many smaller compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments or divisions along the walls. These were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">like cell-compartments, and the low door of each of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">was closed by a black slab that slid down across it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">above. Before these doors there were patrolling in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">long compartment a half-dozen of Neptunian guards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, after being challenged by these, our own leader and</seg><seg type="columnLine">four guards marched us to one of these littfe cell-com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partments, reaching forth to grasp or touch something</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its outside wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the Neptunian leader did so, the door of the cell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment slid smoothly and silently upward, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its opening clear. Without ceremony, then, Marlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and T were motioned to pass inside, and with the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray-tubes of the guards full upon us we had no choice</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the matter. Stepping inside, therefore, we found our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves in a compartment some ten feet square, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, like all the black walls of the compartment-city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">towered for two hundred feet upward around us, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only light the square of dusky sky far above. Then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and I stared about us, the door shot smoothly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down across the opening, and we heard the soft, shuf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling steps of the Neptunian leader and our four guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreating, outside, leaving us gazing at each other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">white faces in silence. Our great mission out to Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune, our great attempt to save earth and prevent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecking of the solar system, had come to an end at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our two friends gone and with Marlin and myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">imprisoned here beyond all hope of escape on Neptune's</seg><seg type="columnLine">peopled moon!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Before the Council</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" I "\RISONED here on Triton--and Whitely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">r*Randall dead! It's the end, Hunt--for us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the earth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin's voice was but echoing my own thoughts in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment, and darkly I nodded. "The end--yes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And less than twelve weeks before that end comes, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the sun's rotatory speed reaches its critical point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it divides into a double star. We've found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of the great ray from Neptune, and we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yet the World-President--the World Congress-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin seemed to be thinking aloud. "They sent us out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dare all for earth, and until earth is destroyed or we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are. dead we can't give up hope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what hope is there?" I asked. "These Neptu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nians have only reprieved us for the moment from death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their own purposes. Death will be ours before long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the meantime who could escape from this place?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 swept my arm around the cel 1-compartment, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin considered the place with me as silently and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as hopelessly as myself. For it was, truly, a prison in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escapable into which we had been thrust. The square</seg><seg type="columnLine">little compartment's walls were diamond-hard, of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">impenetrable black stone-like substance, and they towered</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred feet above us. There were in them no win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows, the only light that reached us being the dusky</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumination that came down to us from the compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment's roofless top, far above. That illumination was</seg><seg type="columnLine">but small indeed, for the cell-compartment lay in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same twilight band as the great Council Compartment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that band-of twilight lying between Triton's dark and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunward sides. By it we could see, however, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black walls about us were quite vertical and smooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the only break in them was that of the low</seg><seg type="columnLine">door-opening, closed now by the smooth, black slab</seg><seg type="columnLine">across it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">266</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was, indeed, a prison from which no efforts of ours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed, could win us free. For even were we to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape from it, wc knew, we would but find ourselves in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great compartment-city that covered all Triton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thronged with the Neptunians' countless millions. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">even that city, in turn, was held beneath the giant metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof that shielded and enclosed all Triton, so that never,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, it seemed, could we hope to be clear of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon-world and escape back across the solar system to</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, to tell the peoples of earth from what strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">source was coming that colossal force-ray that was spin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning the sun on to division and doom. Yet, despite that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and I paced ceaselessly about the little cell in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain endeavor to formulate some plan of escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our first action was to remove from our feet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy-weighted little disks which the Neptunians had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened uport them, and with those removed we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we could jump a score of feet upward in our little</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell, due to the lesser gravitational power of Triton</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared to that of earth, sailing slowly upward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling as slowly. Yet this increased agility seemed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">no avail to us in escaping, since there were no breaks in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the cell's smooth, towering walls by which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we might have been able to jump higher. So, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">some futile attempts, we rested upon the cell's floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, re-attaching to our feet for convenience sake</seg><seg type="columnLine">the super-heavy little disks, that increased our weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its normal earth-figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's useless, Marlin," I said, as we sat here, rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing after our efforts. "We can never get out that way--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or any other, I think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep steady, Hunt," he told me. "We can't do any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing now, it's clear, but a chance will come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It had best come soon, then," I said. "For with but</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighty-odd days left before the end, I see small hope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not reply to that, and I think that the gloom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of utter despair that had settled upon me weighed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him also. They were hours in which there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">change. The twilight that existed here on this band of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton's surface never changed; its dusk never light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened or darkened. The only sounds to be heard, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the occasional staccato voices of the half-dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunian guards outside, or the answering snapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech-sounds of other Neptunians, that seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">confined in cells like ourselves. Later wc were to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">that despite their super-intelligence, perhaps because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, the Neptunians were afflicted now and then with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain disorder in which it seemed that a part of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind's mechanism would cease to function for a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">during which time they were confined in these cell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartinents about us. Save for the staccato speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these and the guards, and the dull, dim, distant roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of clanking and humming and hissing mechanisms that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to us from Triton's sunward side, there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound in our cell except when cylinders throbbed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In those hours the door of our ccll never opened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we found that our food and water were supplied to us</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the cell itself. There were in its wall two metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">taps, one of which yielded clear water, that tasted flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chemical to us. The other gave forth a thick, vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cous white liquid, which we recognized after a time as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a liquefied preparation of the white vegetables and fruits</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had seen grown so rapidly. This preparation or</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid was apparently pumped through the compartment-</seg><seg type="columnLine">city like the water. Thus there was no need for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">guards to enter our cell. It was a number of hours later</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there came an interruption to the monotony of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventlessness of our time, which roused us somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the gloomy apathy of spirit into which we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without warning there sprang into being all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us an intensely brilliant flood of pure white light, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed all things about us in its blinding glare for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment and then swiftly moved away toward the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Triton. We were stupefied by its appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus, and then remembered suddenly the great band of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant light that we had seen appear and move swiftly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely arotuid Triton, marking the end of a ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour period and the signal for the sleeping millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians on Triton's dark side and the busy millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its sunward side to change places upon this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. Surely enough, in a few moments, the brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of light had swept upon us from the sunward side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having traveled completely around Triton, and dwelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment again upon us, had snapped out of being.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That great brilliant band of light, as we were to learn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was produced by great projectors at Triton's two poles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whirled around it by the turning of those project-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ors. Now as its brilliant signal swept around the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon-world, we could hear the countless hordes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians shifting from dark side to sunward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from sunlit side to dark, while overhead there throbbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shot this way and that innumerable cylinders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly as before that great change was accomplished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, as there began again the dull clamor of activity</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the sunward side, Marlin and I turned from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening attention. But at that moment we heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">staccato rattle of speech outside our door, and an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">later the great black slab of that door slid sharply up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and three Neptunians moved inside the cell. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost one of these bore on the metal armor of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great green disk-body a crimson circle that marked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one of the Neptunian officials. The other two were</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently guards brought in as a precautionary meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure, their force-ray tubes unsheathed and leveled un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitatingly upon us. The Neptunian official carried in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his grasp a small octagonal object or mechanism with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a simple button-control, which we gazed at curiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He touched the button-control of it, and there sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it a series of swift, sharp snaps of sound exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">like those of the Neptunians' staccato speech. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking aloud himself, he motioned from himself to us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then to the mechanism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Marlin who first understood his purpose, "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunian language!" he exclaimed. "This one has</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to teach it to us, to make it possible for them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicate with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the mechanism?" I said. "What is its purpose?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ARLIN stared at it a moment, then reached forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and touched its round button-control, bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mechanism an irregular succession of snaps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. "It's for us!" he said suddenly. "They know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that with our different bodies we can't make the sharp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping sounds that are their speech, so have brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">this mechanism to us to serve us as an artificial voice!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Neptunian official, as though he had understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, motioned again to the mechanism and then from</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to us, at the same time uttering a few speech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds as though in explanation. It was plain, indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his object was to teach us the strange Neptunian</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">267</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">speech. Pointing to himself, and to the two guards, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered a succession of five sound-snaps, irregularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaced, over and over again, until it was evident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they represented the name of the Neptunian races. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin and I attempted with the little speaking mecha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nism to reproduce those five snaps of sound, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimenting for a time with the mechanism's button-</seg><seg type="columnLine">control we succeeded. That done, the Neptunian pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us and uttered another short succession of sounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">another word, which we then learned to utter on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus, for hour upon hour, the Neptunian continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us, teaching us word after word, in their strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">staccato language. That language, we found, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much like a communication code of dots and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashes, all its sounds or sound-snaps being of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitch, there being no raising or lowering of the voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while for each word there was a certain combination of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sharp sounds. Quickly, too, after a time, we began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand and learn that strange language, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though never could our own vocal apparatus have pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced the clacking bursts of sharp sound which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">their speecli-sounds, we learned to manipulate easily the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little mechanism that spoke to them for us. Hour fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed hour and day followed day, until we became so</seg><seg type="columnLine">proficient in the knowledge and expression of their words</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to be able to communicate effectively, though halt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, with the great disk-bodied Neptunian who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">teaching us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet we found that that ability served us nothing. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">though we plied the Neptunian with innumerable ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions concerning the great mysteries that we had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">through and that lay about us, he would answer nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What great chain of events had it been that had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mighty Neptune's colossal compartment-city a silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert of death, and that had sent all the Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowding upon Triton? What was their purpose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">directing their mighty force-ray toward the sun, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun ever faster to accomplish its division into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">double star? Why, too, had they sent a second great</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray out in an opposite direction from the first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing out into the vast void of interstellar space ? These</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions we put many times to the great Neptunian who</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught us, but the big, grcen-bodied disk-monster sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply contemplated us as though unhearingly with his bulg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, glassy eyes, and went on with the teaching of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So days followed days while we slowly progressed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our learning of the Neptunian speech, days in which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair that had gathered in our hearts grew darker and</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker. For at last, when more than a score of earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">days had passed, we realized that all was hopeless in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, that even had we chanced to escape, even had we</seg><seg type="columnLine">still our space-flier that had been destroyed with Whitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Randall, we would hardly have time enough to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn from Neptune to earth and bring back the fleet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-fliers that were being prepared on earth. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more than a half-hundred days, indeed, remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">before that last day that would sec the sun splitting at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last to engulf almost all its planets, for with each day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew, the giant force-ray of the Neptunians emanat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from Triton was turning the sun faster and faster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice, indeed, I almost made a wild attempt to over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come our Neptunian teacher and guards, but was held</seg><seg type="columnLine">back by Marlin, who knew as well as I that instant death</seg><seg type="columnLine">only could result from such an attempt. And as those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">days passed, as with each ten hours the great band of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light went around Triton and the millions of Neptunians</seg><seg type="columnLine">on dark and sunward sides interchanged, I came to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">on death as a release from the agony of suspense and</seg><seg type="columnLine">torture in which we were. I think that not much longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">could either Marlin or I have endured the terrible torture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that .imprisonment, when there came at last a break</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it, on the twenty-second day of our captivity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On that day, as we waited in the unchanging twilight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the coming of our Neptunian teacher and his two</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, we were astonished when the door slid up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find facing us outside a different Neptunian official, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same insignia of the crimson circle, with four guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him instead of two. He did not speak to us, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">motioned us silently to move outside, and as we did so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gestured to Marlin to take with us the small speech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism by which we were able to converse with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians. Then, guarded closely before and behind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our attempted escape in the cylinder having kept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians extremely watchful of us ever since, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched out of the long oblong compartment of the cells</seg><seg type="columnLine">and across others toward the great circular Council Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment! Into it we were marched, and found that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as before, there sat around the great ring-table the thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent members of the Council, the great metal globe still</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its pedestal at their center. They did not turn toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">us as we entered and halted beside them, but the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe did, turning first the single gleaming eye upon us</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of which, we knew, all the massed minds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thirty members of the Council were receiving a visual</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the globe turned swiftly so that its speech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening faced us, and it spoke to us, spoke as the assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled minds of the thirty, with all emotions removed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all thoughts synthesized by its mechanism. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the two creatures captured upon our world ?" it asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you have been taught our language as we or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marlin pressed the button of the little mechanism in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his grasp, speaking back in the same snapping speech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds by means of it. "We are those two," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The globe was silent a moment, then spoke on, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty whose minds spoke through it never turning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When you two were captured upon our great world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, no doubt like you, were discovered in a space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle which, it was apparent, was operated by the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle of forcc-rays which we of Neptune (it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own word-equivalent for the name of the planet)</seg><seg type="columnLine">have long used in our own space-vehicles, and in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways. That vehicle and those inside it, it has been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported to us, were destroyed by those who discovered it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we desire to know from whence it and you two name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in what way you were able to reproduce the force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays which we of Neptune have long used. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure of your bodies it is apparent that you come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a small planet, in all probability the second or third</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun's worlds.

"It is from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun's third world, indeed, that we have come," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "And we have come here, have plunged out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the void to this, the sun's outermost world, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out why you of Neptune are loosing doom on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system with that great force-ray of yours that</seg><seg type="columnLine">268</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spins the sun ever faster, and to use all our power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">halt that doom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN that tense moment a thrill of irrepressible pride shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through me, even in the dark peril in which we stood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Marlin's words.

It was evident that the human passions of hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and anger held small place in their cold, machine-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds, for the great globe that spoke for the minds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the assembled thirty was silent for a time, and when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did speak it seemed not to regard the passion of Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin's words,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you speak of halting the doom that confronts</seg><seg type="columnLine">3'our world," it said, "it is apparent that you do not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">the necessity of that doom, the great necessity which</seg><seg type="columnLine">has caused our races of Neptunians, under the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Council of Thirty, to loose that doom upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system.

Marlin and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there at the great ring-tablc's edge, and surely no</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger scene could have been imagined than that, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great circular compartment's towering black walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">around us, the twilight that reigned above and around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thirty silent dislc-bodied Neptunians and our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk-bodied guards, and the great, enigmatic globe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism hefore us, that spoke and listened as a living</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, representing the massed minds of the thirty.

It is most wise that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you learn now how useless it is for you or any of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">world to oppose yourselves to the plans of us Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunians. For wc of Neptune arc of an ancient power</seg><seg type="columnLine">and might, beside which you of the inner planets arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">as newcome children. And lest you doubt that power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lest you doubt the colossal forces that we of Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">have called into being and use for our own purposes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we of the Council tell you now what mighty past is ours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oldest of all the eight worlds of this solar system,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, is our world of Neptune. This you must know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, if your scientists know aught of the formation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun's planets. For those eight planets were</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed unthinkable eons ago, out of the fiery sun itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up to that time the sun had moved through space en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely without planets, one of the countless stars of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">galaxy of stars, all moving through the void in differing</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions. One of these other stars chanced to be mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the general direction of our own star, our own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, and their mutual attraction for each other drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">them closer together, until at last they passed each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely, perhaps even touched each other, their nearness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to each other causing by gravitational attraction huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of the flaming gaseous substance of each to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose. Thus the space between the two passing suns</seg><seg type="columnLine">was filled with those great flaming masses, and as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated, each by its gravitational power drew a share</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those fiery masses with it on its path through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">void.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thus when the two suns receded from each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more, each carried with it a rough half of the fiery</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses that had been torn from each. As tlie sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved on through space with these fiery masses about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, the greater part of them dropped back into the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The flaming masses that remained, however, had Ijeen</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown by the cataclysm into a swift motion, which by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun's attraction had been converted in the ease of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each flaming mass into a circular or elliptical orbit around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun. And since the speed of each flaming mass just</seg><seg type="columnLine">balanced with its centrifugal force the pull of the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">inward, they continued in those orbits for age on age</seg><seg type="columnLine">without perceptible change. The solar system, then, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become stable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thus the sun was moving on through space with</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight great flaming masses of matter revolving around</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, in addition to a number of great clouds or aggrega-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of smaller fragments. These eight flaming masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">became in time the sun's eight worlds, a solid crust</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming first on one and then on another of them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">outermost of these great fiery masses was that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time was to become the planet Neptune. It had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the first of the great fragments of the two suns</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn loose by their encounter, and being one of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been hurled out to a greater distance than any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others. And being the first, too, it had had more</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to cool, ils solid crust had formed earlier on it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus Neptune was in fact the oldest of the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets to form as a solid-surfaced world. Neptune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, is composed of much lighter materials than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">denser inner planets, and the reason for that is, that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the lighter matter of the two suns that had naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">been sent flying forth from them in their encounter;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus the outer planets, the four great outer worlds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being of the sun's lighter matter, are all much less in</seg><seg type="columnLine">density than the four smaller inner worlds, which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown forth lalcr from the sun's heavier matter, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus in smaller masses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So out of tlie great irregular-shaped outermost</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of flaming gases had been formed the great planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune and its .smaller moon of Triton. And as Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune's surface solidified, as the great masses of water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor and air that made up its dense and immense atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere ensheathed it, it became a habitable world, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit for life and the continuation of life. For though</seg><seg type="columnLine">small heat came to distant Neptune across the great void</seg><seg type="columnLine">of almost three billion miles that separated it from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, the sun giving it indeed a heat hardly perceptible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet there was heat enough for the great world in its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiery interior. For so great in size was Neptune that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though a solid crust had formed upon it, there still lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath that crust the vast raging fires of its interior,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and those fires' heat was so great that they kept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of Neptune and the dense atmosphere above that</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface warmed constantly. And Triton had an atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere also and interior warming fires.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">269</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thus great Neptune, though farthest of all planets</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sun, became habitable the earliest of all. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">since, wherever a world is found on which life is pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, life sooner or later will arise, so it arose on Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune. Race upon race of living creatures rose upon it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and race after race vanished, annihilated by changing</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions on its surface which they could not withstand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not until we disk-bodied Neptunians evolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the great world's surface, indeed, that there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a permanent form of life upon it. For we, whose disk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">l&gt;odies owed their squat, flat shapes to the gravitational</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of Neptune, so much greater than that of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner worlds, had in larger measure that spark of intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligence which the other creatures had lacked. And with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gleam of ruiud, of intelligence, wc were able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">withstand the changing conditions on Neptune's surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">by adapting ourselves to those conditions, growing ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">in numbers and spreading out over our world's surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until at last we swarmed in millions uponjt and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising into greater and greater comprehension of the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse about us, into greater and greater intelligence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">REAT buildings we built upon Neptune's surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deep we tunnelled below its surface, also.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through breaks in the great cloud-sereen about our</seg><seg type="columnLine">world we looked forth and saw with our instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other planets that moved about our sun, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth also into space and saw the hosts of other suns</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moved at vast distances from our own. Our eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were accustomed to the dim Neptunian day, our bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its great gravitational power, and it was our home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. Yet by this time so vast had become our num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers that millions of us were crowded too closely together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and desired to migrate to Triton, our moon, and settle</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. And though we had never yet been able to sally</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth from the surface of our own great world of Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune, we found the way to do so then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That way was given to us by the discovery by our</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists of a new force-vibration, one that lay in wave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">length between the light vibrations and the higher elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical vibrations. This force-vibration, they found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exerted a definite pressure or force upon any object</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck by its waves, just as the light-rays themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">exert a definite, though far smaller, pressure upon what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever matter they strike. With this new force-ray, there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, we planned to propel vehicles through space, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we constructed great cylindrical vehicles which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hurtle out into space by generating inside them a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray which would be shot back against a world</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus propel them by repulsion away from that world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These cylinders were made and tested, and since they</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked perfectly, we constructed many of them, enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take out all the millions of our surplus population</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Triton. And so in those cylinders those millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians went hurtling out to Triton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They found, as our observations had shown us, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton had a good atmosphere, and that it was swarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">already with many forms of life, some of them unutter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably grotesque, and none of more than the lowest in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligence. Using weapons of concentrated force-rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which clove through all they touched, our millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians proceeded to annihilate all life ujxm Triton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with that accomplished, proceeded to build for them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves structures and cities like those on Neptune. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that Triton was a perfectly habitable world for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them save for two considerations. One of these was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lesser gravitational power of it, which made it ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely inconvenient for them to move on it with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunian muscles. They solved this problem by at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taching to their limbs small and unobtrusive disks of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely heavy metal which we could make by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial massing of atom-prolons without electrons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These disks increased their weight to such a point that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could move as freely and conveniently on Triton as</seg><seg type="columnLine">•on Neptune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The other problem facing them on Triton was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that it turned one face always toward the sun. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotation 011 its axis, indeed, was of just enough speed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">counteract its revolution around Neptune and Neptune's</seg><seg type="columnLine">own revolution around the sun, the sum total of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements resulting in this keeping of one side always</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the sun, with that side always palely lit by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun and the other always in darkness. Even when Triton</seg><seg type="columnLine">was behind Neptune, invisible perhaps from your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">world by reason oi the edge of Neptune's great atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere projecting up to hide it somewhat, Triton's orbit</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so slanted or inclined toward the plane of the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system that the sun was always in sight of its sunward</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, though dimmed a little when the edge of Neptune's</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere was between them. The Neptunians who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone to Triton were accustomed to Neptune's</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternating day and night, of approximately ten hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">each, and so they solved the problem by living upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlit side of Triton for ten hours, for a day, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing to the dark side for ten hours of night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thus they had conquered all die inconveniences that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had faced them in settling upon Triton, and so upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton as upon Neptune were Neptunians and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities. The civilization of both Neptune-and its circling</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon seemed secure and unchangeable, indeed; a civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that existed upon our world and its moon when</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the other planets of the solar system held only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowest forms of life, if life they held at all. Easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">could we of Neptune have ventured into the sun's other</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds had we wished, in our space-cylinders, but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no desire to do so, having learned all that wc wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those worlds by observation with our instruments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and being content to remain safe upon our great world</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Neptune and smaller moon-world of Triton. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe we remained there, for ages, yet, during all those</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages, there was coming closer toward us a great crisis</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had long before foreseen, yet which we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered so remote a peril as to give it 110 attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But now that peril had become close, and great. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was none other than the extinction of all life on both</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune and Triton that faced us, due to their steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooling. For all worlds, however fiery their interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool in time and die. And steadily, surely, the interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires of both Neptune and its moon had been cooling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the substance solidifying. Already they had cooled so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far that the surface oi Neptune was much colder than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever before, and that of Triton also, and with each pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing century that, cold was increasing. It would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of time only, it was plain, before both Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its moon would lie utterly without life, a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">frigidity reigning upon each, all life perished from them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that bitter cold. For though worlds nearer the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">might exist by means of the sun's heat, though life on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them could cling to existence through the sun's warmth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune and its moon were so unthinkably distant from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun that almost no heat reached them from it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">270</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as their interior fires cooled, they must inevitably become</seg><seg type="columnLine">so cold as to annihilate all life upon them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was evident that some great plan must be adopted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would prevent this condition, and such a plan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly dccidcd upon. This plan was to enclose both</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune and Triton with great roofs of metal that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold in them the heat that was being radiated out, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would make it possible to aid the failing heat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two worlds by artificial means. It would be a gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">task to place those great roofs about Neptune and Tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, but we set to work upon it and for years upon years</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the energies of the Neptunians were centered upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the construction of those roofs. We had established</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast workshops in which the plates of metal that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to form the great roofs were turned ceaselessly forth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and these in turn were joined together to make the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof of giant Neptune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It had been decided that that great roof that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enclose Neptune would have no supports whatever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For that roof was to be in effect a gigantic spherical</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell enclosing Neptune, and as such it would float in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space around Neptune without touching it at any spot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the attraction of Neptune upon the roof would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same in all parts; thus it would not be pulled to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">side or that, and would not touch the great planet in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. The small attraction of the sun and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavenly bodies on the free-floating spherical enclosure</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nullified by an automatic force-ray pressing against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inside of the roof in the right direction, and thus the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant spherical shell could enclose Neptune, and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">float about it, moving with it through space, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching it at any point!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The metal plates, that had been joined together to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the vast spherical shell, were of a strength to resist</seg><seg type="columnLine">all stresses, and they had been specially treated by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystallizing process that gave them a unique property.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the property of admitting all heat and light</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations from above through them, but repelling those</seg><seg type="columnLine">from below. Thus when the great roof was in place</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Neptune, enclosing it completely, the sun's light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heat penetrated down to it through the roof without</seg><seg type="columnLine">check, making the roof seem transparent from below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rut no light or heat vibrations could pass up through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof from beneath, so that it appeared quite opaque</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above. Thus what light and heat the sun furnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not lost, and Neptune's day not darkened. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">very little of that heat of Neptune itself could be radiated</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward into space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With the great roof in place around Neptune, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with openings that could be opened and closed at will</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided in it, for entrance to or exit from Neptune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a similar roof, though far smaller, was constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the smaller globe of Triton. With those great</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosures thus shielding Neptune and Triton, there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, their cooling was slowed, and it seemed to all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expedient of the great roofs had warded off the men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acing cold that had threatened to extinguish all life on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune and Triton. Strange new cities were built on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune and Triton, great compartment-cities that</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed not roofs with the great roof above them. New</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods were found of producing vast food supplies</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the crowding millions of Neptunians, by stimulating</seg><seg type="columnLine">with electrical force and chemicals the growth of vegeta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to an unthinkably swift rate. Thus we Neptunians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our giant enclosed world of Neptune and in our en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed moon, Triton, had checked the colossal peril that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had threatened us and could continue to live safely upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune and its moon for age upon passing age!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">To Split the Sun!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">E had checked the great peril that had hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">over us, but we found, as the centuries and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages passed, that we had only checked it, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had not banished it. For nothing in the universe</seg><seg type="columnLine">could halt the cooling of Neptune and Triton. As their</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior fires cooled, colder and colder grew their sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces, despite the roofs that enclosed them. It was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had recourse to another means of halting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">oncoming cold--the use of artificial heat. We set up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the giant compartment-city of Neptune, and in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Triton also, great globes that radiated out unceasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and intense heat. These globes held inside them their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own mechanisms, mechanisms that could change etheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations of electricity and light and others into hcat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations, by changing their wavelength. And with</seg><seg type="columnLine">these radiating their ceaseless heat, and with the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosing roofs, the oncoming cold was again checked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yet after a time we were forced to recognize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this check also was but temporary. For we were fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most grim and hopeless battle in the universe; we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fighting against the relentless and inevitable changes</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused by the immutable physical laws of the universe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So that, aid its failing heat as we might with artificial</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat-producers, the interior heat of Neptune was waning</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, and more and more globe heat-radiators were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired to keep the temperature of Neptune at its usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">height. The Neptunians of Triton were faced with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same problem, but their situation was not so desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">as of those upon Neptune, since though Triton had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooled as quickly, its enclosed space was so much smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Neptune's, its great roof so close to it also, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was possible with an effort to keep enough heat-mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anisms going there to maintain the warmth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On Neptune, however, the struggle became more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more desperate, our great struggle against the blind laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nature. For as Neptune's interior heat declined</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther and farther, it became more and more impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us to keep enough heat-mechanisms going to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">it warm enough for life. And at last, after years upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of that awful struggle against fate, wc of Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized at last that it was no longer possible to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune warm enough for us to exist there, and that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must leave it at once for some other world if we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape extinction; since as the great planet's interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat declined, it became more and more agonizing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to keep enough heat for life by means of the heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms, and it was clear to all that the end was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand unless we left Neptune!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But where could we go? Even if one of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets were suitable to receive us, we could not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">transported all our masses from Neptune to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet in time to escapc the doom of cold and death that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was closing down upon Neptune. To transport all those</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses would have required countless trips with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">limited number of cylinders And to take refuge upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">another planet, even had lime been ours, was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the question. For long our scientists had studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other planets with their instruments, and though</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them were so cloud-wreathed and others so dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">271</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tant as to make observation difficult, it had long been</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to us that none of the other planets, due to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural conditions or to the presence of intelligent alien</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings already upon them, would be possible as a world</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us Neptunians.

That place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton, our peopled moon. For peopled as that moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was with its own masses of Neptunians, struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the same menacing cold that had vanquished us</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Neptune, it was the one refuge for our peoples. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowding into its every comer, the countless millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Neptune's peoples would be able to exist upon Triton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aud though the cooling of Triton had menaced it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold also, it has been found, as we have mentioned, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not so hard to keep Triton warm by means of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial globular heat-mcchanisms, the space enclosed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">its great spherical roof being much smaller. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate expedient, truly, to mass all the thronging mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions from the compartment-city that covered all giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune, to mass all those millions upon little Triton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet that was the one expedient open, and so it was fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Out from Neptune to Triton went all the cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">of both worlds, loaded with as many Neptunians as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could carry, depositing those Neptunians upon Triton</seg><seg type="columnLine">and racing back for more. Countless trips made those</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of cylinders, trip after swift trip, each occupy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hut little time because Triton was so near. And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last there came a day when the whole of Neptune's</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions had been transported out to Tritoil, when there</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained on Neptune itself no single, one of our races,</seg><seg type="columnLine">out giant world lying cold and deserted and dead, 110</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer a habitable world, its vast compartment-city empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the millions that had for ages swarmed through it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while all those millions were crowded now upon little</seg><seg type="columnLine">T riton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And so crowded were those vast hordes of the Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunian races that for a time it seemed that they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not exist in such numbers upon Triton. This crowd-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was made less acute, however, by an expedient now</seg><seg type="columnLine">adopted by us. As mentioned, the Neptunians who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled upon Triton long before had found that the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing day on one side of it and the unchanging night</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other were, inconvenient for them after the alter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations of Neptune's day and night, and so had begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlie custom of spending a day of ten hours upon the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit side of Triton and a night of equal length upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark side, Aud now we found that we could make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowding of our races upon Triton less acute by</seg><seg type="columnLine">having half of them working and active upon the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward side for ten hours while the other half slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">through their night on the dark side. Every ten hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">these two halves of our people changed sides, changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from day to night, a signal having been devised to mark</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hour for that change, a signal which consisted of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant band of intense light, that passed swiftly around</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoth Triton's dark and sunward sides. With this shift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of our peoples each ten hours it was possible to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of all of Triton's surface, and thus the crowding of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our peoples upon it was made less acute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yet that crowding was still very great. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thronging Neptunians that had existed upon the surface</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of giant Neptune had been poured out on little Triton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">far, far less in size than its great parent-world. Aud</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus, though they could exist upon it, it was existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">only that was possible to the Neptunians 011 Triton, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">this awful crowding would grow worse, we knew, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than better. And also, and more important, here on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton the same deadly menace that had driven us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune was again confronting us. For even as Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune had coolcd, Triton had cooled, was cooling also.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And though we strained every effort to keep the warmth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Triton constant, though we sent cylinders constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to dead and deserted Neptune to bring from it more</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat-mechanisms and other needed mechanisms, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that even as 011 Neptune we were fighting a losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle with nature. For Triton was cooling, was cooling</seg><seg type="columnLine">still farther, and soon would be completely cold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead, its interior heat gone out into space. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">that happened, 110 number of heat-mechanisms could keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth upon it, even beneath the great enclosing roof,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all life on it must perish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Neptunian races had come to their last stand!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crowded upon our refuge of Triton, striving with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">our power to keep upon it the warmth, without which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could not live, we saw at last that some new and</seg><seg type="columnLine">radically different plan must be found, or we could no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer exist. So all the greatest of our Neptunian scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists were called together by us, the Council of Thirty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Into a great conclave here 011 Triton they were called, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, without equivocation of any sort, and to the races</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Neptunians, tlie situation that confronted us was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated. We had been driven from Neptune by the relent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less growing cold, and now that same cold was upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">us here at Triton, was threatening us here also with</seg><seg type="columnLine">annihilation.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, and most obvious plan, was migration to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. But here we were checked by the same consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erations that had made us unwilling to try that before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for we knew by observation of the other planets that</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon none of them could we live as we lived upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune. Some of them were greater in size than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune, with greater gravitational power, and that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a difficulty that could not be overcome by us since upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">those planets our weight would be so increased as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make us helpless, even had those planets been fit for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. Some planets were peopled by intelligent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful races which we might be able to conquer after</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible struggles.

And we had, also, no desire to move to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, in truth, since so many ages had it taken for us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to build our great compartment-cities upon Neptune and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton, to shield them with their great roofs, that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible for us to leave them, even had we been able,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to start anew upon another world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must remain with our own great world, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain, but how then could we continue to live?

To you it is a source of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceaseless blazing heat, of brilliant light, warming your</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds sometimes to scorching, no doubt.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">with those two suns separated as they were, by a distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two billion miles, Neptune would be near always to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those suns, because it would undoubtedly sweep</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer to them when the cataclysm occurred, and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take up an elliptical orbit about them with the two suns</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the foci of that ellipse.

Yet what hope was</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">273</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thejg that this could happen? We knew that the reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">■tffher suns, of the universe divide into double or multiple</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars is because they have reachcd a rate of rotatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed that makes it impossible for them longer to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. For when a sun is spinning its mass tends to</seg><seg type="columnLine">split up by its own centrifugal force, just as a turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel, and the faster the sun spins the greater grows its</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrifugal force, the greater its tendency to split. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then at last that rate of spin grows so great, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrifugal force is such that its mass can no longer hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, and fission takes place, the sun dividing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three or even more stars, that push apart from</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other. But what chance was there of the sun doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ? For the sun, we knew, rotated at the speed of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn in 25 days, at its equator, and to split it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be rotating at a speed of one turn in an hour. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant that it would be unthinkable eons before the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotatory speed would have increased to that point. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">though a sun's rotatory speed does increase as time</seg><seg type="columnLine">passes, due to the shrinkage of its mass, it increases so</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinitely slowly that it would be eons, indeed, before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's rate of spin would be so great as to cause its</seg><seg type="columnLine">division. And thus there seemed small hope indeed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'HEN it was that those scientists revealed to us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> JL the heart of their plan, and made clear to us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true colossal nature of their suggestion. What, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, if we ourselves increase the sun's rotatory speed ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What if we of Neptune should reach across the void</seg><seg type="columnLine">of almost three billion miles and set the sun to spinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster, spinning it ever faster and faster until it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">readied the critical point, until it turned once in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour? Fission would result then, the sun would divide</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a double star as they had calculated, and all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefits mentioned would come to us, and Neptune and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its moon would be warmed always by the heat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two suns about which they would revolve. If we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do that, if we could reach across the void and set the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun to spinning ever faster, it would soon divide into</seg><seg type="columnLine">two new suns, and thus we would have saved ourselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet we were thunderstruck by this suggestion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunian sdentists. To reach out across the infinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues of space that lay between our outermost planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sun, to turn that sun ever faster until it split</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a double star--how ever could such a gigantic, stupe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fying feat as that be accomplished?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the Neptunians who had suggested this plan now</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly explained how that colossal deed could be accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished. Long before, indeed, we had discovered force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations, finding them a vibration that exerted tangible</seg><seg type="columnLine">and definite pressure or force upon whatever matter they</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck. And we had used those force-rays in some ways.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had used them to propel our cylindrical vehicles out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through space from Neptune to Triton, and vice versa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had used them also, concentrated into slender, penril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like rays of great power, as weapons, since those con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated rays penetrated and destroyed all that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched. Now our scientists proposed to use them for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this huge plan--to reach across the void, across the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system, and to turn the sun ever faster, until the desired</seg><seg type="columnLine">division of it had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Nor was this, as they outlined it, impracticable. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, turning there in space at the center of the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system, has naturally one edge or limb turning away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us, and the other turning toward us. Now, if we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed colossal generators of the force-vibrations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators that could produce a gigantic ray that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have almost inconceivable power, and shot that ray across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solar system toward the edge of the sun turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from us, what would happen? It was dear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">that great ray, striking against the side of the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass turning away from us, striking that side with titanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure and force, would tend to turn that side faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from us, would tend in that way to make the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun turn faster! Such a gigantic ray, though it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase the sun's spin thus but slowly, would continue to</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase the sun's spin steadily as long as it was kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned upon the sun's side. Slowly, but steadily, the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">would turn ever faster, until soon it would have reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">that critical rotatory speed, of one turn in one hour, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make its centrifugal force so great as to make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">divide into a double star, and so save us of Neptune from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cold death that hung over us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thus this mighty plan was presented to us, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at once accepted by us of the Council of Thirty, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the Neptunian races. For we saw that in it lay our</seg><seg type="columnLine">one chance for life, our one chance to halt the doom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our races, our worlds, and to halt that doom we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to make any effort. We knew that the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets of the solar system, that the seven other worlds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this universe and all their moons, would go to flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">death when our plan succeeded, would be annihilated</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the sun divided, but we recked not of that. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last necessity was upon us, the last closing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the doom that we had fought against so long, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remove the shadow of that doom from over us, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to send to a more terrible doom all the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets of the solar system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only one great difficulty lay before us.

And how? It was evident that the giant ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be sent from Neptune's surface. For not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only would it be almost impossible to keep its great</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism working in the constant terrible cold that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reigned there, but Neptune's rotation would make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to send the ray forth from any spot on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great planet, since because of Neptune's rotation, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow that that spot--that great ray, would be toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun half the time, on Neptune's sunward side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other half would have turned and point away into</seg><seg type="columnLine">space from its dark or outer side.

When this gigantic force-ray reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">out across the gulf, and struck the sun, it would push the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's side with inconceivable power, as was planned, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a power great enough to turn that sun's titanic mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster.

And at last we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a remedy for this difficulty, found a means by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it might be overcome. Triton would he pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the gulf of space away from the solar system</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever, when its great force-ray struck the sun's edge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what, it was asked, if Triton were braced against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">push outward of that great raj', were braced by a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray of equal colossal power shooting out from it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an opposite direction against some great mass, tending</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that way to push Triton inward toward the sun even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the great raj' striking the sun would tend to push</seg><seg type="columnLine">it outward? The result would be obviously, that Triton</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be pushed on either side by the two opposing great</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-rays with equal power, and being so pushed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them it would not move either inward or outward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And thus being immovable, being braced against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure of the ray shot toward the sun by the pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ray shot out into the void against as great a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, Triton's ray striking the sun's edge would, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired, turn that sun faster and faster, spin its huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass faster without affecting Triton itself! For, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two great rays being so exactly balanced in power, Triton</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be affected in the least in its own positions or</seg><seg type="columnLine">motions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was needed, then, only a second great force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray to go out into space opposite in direction to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the first. It meant, however, that since tlie first was</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiating straight toward the sun from Triton's sunward</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, .the second must radiate straight away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun from Triton's dark side, which would make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second ray point out into the void toward the constella-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in which it would be in reference to the sun. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, we calculated that by the Lime all would be ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to send the force-ray in toward the sun, the constella-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion Sagittarius would be straight out from Neptune and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun ; then the second ray would need to be sent out</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Sagittarius. For it would be, then, against one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great stars of Sagittarius that this second opposing</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray would strike, to brace Triton against the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray striking the sun, the star calculated Ixjst for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose being the bright star in the quadrilateral of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sagittarius. It was apparent, therefore, that when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great forc.e-ray was shot toward the sun, the second or</seg><seg type="columnLine">bracing ray should be shot out against that bright star in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sagittarius to brace Triton against the first ray's push.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"\/rET in reality the problem was not as simple as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> i. that.

But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would require a number of years for the second great</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray, traveling at the same speed, to reach the bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">star in Sagittarius and strike against it. For even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest of the stars, of course, lies so far from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system, our universe, that it requires years for light</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cross that colossal distance; in consequence it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">require as long or longer for the second force-ray to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross such a great distance, traveling as it would at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed almost that of light. Thus, since that bright star</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Sagittarius that had been fixed upon lay dozens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-years from our solar system, it would require</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozens of years for that second great force-ray to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">that star!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was evident, therefore, that tlie second force-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">would need to be shot out toward that star long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first, since it was vitally necessary that the two rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike their objects at the same moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The first thing to do, therefore, was to prepare the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great generators and send that second ray out toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sagittarius. That work was begun at once, for only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short time was left us. On Triton's dark side, beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great roof, countless great generators were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed, giant generators of the force-vibrations which</seg><seg type="columnLine">could by their massed power produce a colossal ray of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unthinkable power.

That mechanism was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, upon Triton's surface, and was cut off from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of that surface by the metal walls that rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">around it to the roof, since in that way it was possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to send the great ray out from Triton's surface through</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opening in the great roof, the enclosing walls or sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pit preventing the warm air beneath tlie roof from</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaping outward, and keeping it air-tight as ever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">275</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With that much done, the controls of the colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray and its generators were then constructed.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">single control-box would have been enough, but our</seg><seg type="columnLine">object in having a score of control boxes was clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough.

So those</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls were not entrusted to a single control-box but</seg><seg type="columnLine">were duplicated in twenty, so that if any one control-</seg><seg type="columnLine">box was destroyed or harmed in any way, or even if a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-score or more were so destroyed or harmed, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ray would continue to go forth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With that done, with the great generators ready, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray-mechanism or opening ready, and the control-boxes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their intricate controls all completed, the first step</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finished and there remained but to turn on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant ray, to send it forth to that bright star in Sagit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarius. So on the day that had been designated, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians to whom had been entrusted the all-important</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch of the twenty controls, took their places in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">control-boxes. The great ray-mechanism had been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed in Triton's dark side, of course, that it pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly toward that star which the ray was to strike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so it was needed only to turn on the giant ray. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, at last, with all the Neptunians gathered there be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the roof around the walls of the giant pit, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">through those walls, transparent from within, we gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word. Then, as one, the twenty controls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened, and from the gathered throbbing generators</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the great ray-mechanism at the huge pit's bottom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there drove upward and outward into the great void of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space the colossal force-ray, visible only near its source</seg><seg type="columnLine">as pale light, flashing out at almost the speed of light it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, on its stupendous journey across the void toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bright star in Sagittarius that was its goal!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was no push against Triton, of course, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">that colossal ray went forth, for there could be no push</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Triton until that ray struck a solid body, struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the star that was its goal, and then it would push back</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Triton. Just as if you reach forth to push your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self away from a wall, there is no push on your body</seg><seg type="columnLine">until your hand reaches the wall. Not until dozens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">years had passed, we knew, would that great ray strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">the star in Sagittarius that was its goal, and not until</seg><seg type="columnLine">then would come the back-push against Triton, the brac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back-piish that was its purpose. And in those dozens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years, with the great ray shot ceaselessly forth to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">star, of course, Neptune and Triton themselves would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving somewhat, would be moving as Neptune followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">its slow orbit around the sun. But so slow and so vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Neptune's orbit-movement, that it would have moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">but little, and as it moved, the ray-mechanism would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned constantly a very little so that its great ray would</seg><seg type="columnLine">still be directed ceaselessly toward the star in Sagittarius,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so that when that ray struck that star, Neptune and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton would be just between or in line with the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that distant star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thus half of our great task was finished, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained but to complete the other half, to make ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the sending forth of the other great force-ray, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first one as we called it, toward the sun. In the years</seg><seg type="columnLine">that followed, while the great force-ray traveled cease-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly, on and on through the great void, toward that~</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant star that was its goal, we Neptunians were busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">here upon Triton with the making ready of the newer</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray. On Triton's sunward side, directly opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other force-ray's source, we constructed again</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great generators that would be used for this newer</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray, massing them there beneath the great roof. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">those generators finished, we began again to construct</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great pit or well in the roof, and to place at its bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray-mechanism that would send this newer force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray in through the. solar system toward the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Terrible years were those for us, though now at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">this terrible time approaches its end. For in those years</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had not only to keep on the immense task of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structing generators and mechanisms for the newer</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray, and to keep operating the other great genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors and mechanisms that were sending forth ceaselessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great forcc-ray toward Sagittarius; we had also to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight against the ever-encroaching cold that'was deepen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ever its dread menace over us, and that seemed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point of overcoming us even as we reached the climax</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our giant fight against doom. For ever that cold on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triton grew greater as it grew still cooler at its heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ever we must make greater and greater efforts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep operating the innumerable heat-mechanisms that</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone held death back from us. Yet we spurred ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">onward by the thought that now at last we were ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching victory over this dread menace of cold that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had beset us for so long, for at last the dozens of years</seg><seg type="columnLine">required were drawing to an end and the great force-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fast nearing the star in Sagittarius that was its</seg><seg type="columnLine">goal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"QO we labored on with all our strength, and soon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kJ mechanisms of the new giant force-ray were fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, its great pit ready in Triton's sunward side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twenty control-boxes set in that pit's walls. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last was approaching the crucial moment of our great</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan, that moment in which all must be calculated and</seg><seg type="columnLine">performed with infinite care lest we meet disaster. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest of our scientists had many times, in those years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculated the exact moment when the huge force-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had shot forth would meet at last the star in Sagit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarius, would strike against that star. It was necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the other giant force-ray that we were to send forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the sun would strike the sun's edge at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment exactly as the other ray struck that star, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the same power exactly. So all was anxiety un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterable as wre approached this great climax of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By this time, scores of your earth-davs ago, Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">in following its orbit had moved so that it was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly between the sun and that distant star in Sagit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarius toward which the ray was shooting. The fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Triton revolved about Neptune did not impede that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray, of course, since as you know Triton moves about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune in an orbit slanted greatly, inclined greatly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ecliptic, and so even when on the outer side of Nep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune its ray would be able to go straight toward the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the upper limits of Neptune's atmosphere, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so in the same way, even when it was on the sunward</seg><seg type="columnLine">276</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">6ide of Neptune, its great ray, that we had sent forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">years before, could shoot directly toward the star in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sagittarius. The only thing needful was that the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">we sent forth toward the sun be of the same power and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike it exactly when the other ray struck that distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">star, go that they would push hack against Triton with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same force at the same time,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '■'So in tense anxiety we remained and at last there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment for which we waited, more than four hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the time wheu we calculated the other ray would</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike the star in .Sagittarius. And when that moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the signal was given and the new mighty force-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shot forth, from Triton's sunward side, shot, forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward that edge of the sun turning away from us!</seg><seg type="columnLine">That ray, of course, had no planets directly between it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sun, we having chosen long before a time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole plan when this would not happen. But hi the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours and more that followed, we millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptunians waited .here on Triton with suspense un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterable. The moment was approaching when this giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-ray would strike the sun. If we had calculated</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrongly, if the other giant ray did not strike that star</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Sagittarius at the same moment, Triton would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled out to doom in the great void by the sun-ray's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure! Tensely we waited and then at last there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment for which we had waited. That moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, and passed--that moment in which the new giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray struck the sun--yet Triton did not move beneath its</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "W.c knew that we had won!

Its huge mass was spin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning faster as our great ray stabbed from Triton to press</seg><seg type="columnLine">against that mass' edge with colossal force! Within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first earlh-day the pressure of that great ray against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's edge had increased the sun's speed of spin at almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exact .amount we had calculated, had decreased its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotatory period by four hours.

From that</seg><seg type="columnLine">position the square little opening of the cell, two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet above, seemed infinitely distant, yet I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair, drawing a long breath and then with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of my musclcs leaping obliquely upward. Upward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and slantwise thus 1 went with tite force of that leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more than a score of feet, toward the opposite wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">that much higher from the floor, seeming to float smooth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly up--so much slower than on earth was my progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And as I shot smoothly toward the opposite wall I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting myself in mid-air, so that when I struck that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, more than a score of feet above the floor, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet that struck it. And as they struck it, bent with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my impact against the wall, I abruptly straightened them</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, shot suddenly away from that wall again on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward slant again toward the other wall. Again, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated upward, I was twisting in mid-air to strike that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall feet-foremost, and again as 1 struck it I was kicking</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it with my legs, so that hardly had I touched it</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I was shooting back across the cell again toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlie opposite wall, but again on an upward slant, gaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">a score of feet on each strange leap I made thus across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cell! Thus, in zig-zag leaps from wall to wall, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">progressing up the narrow cell toward its roofless top</seg><seg type="columnLine">far above! It was just tlie same as when on earth a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in a wide chimney can work himself up from bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">to top of it by bracing himself now against one wall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now against another. And the fact that the cell was</seg><seg type="columnLine">much wider, could only be touched wall at a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was counterbalanced by the fact of Triton's far lesser</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational power, which alone w§6 hiaking it possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me to continue my strange progress upward! * * •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On Triton alone, indeed, or on a world of similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">size and gravitational power, was such a feat possible*</seg><seg type="columnLine">for only thus could one leap with such new impetus each</seg><seg type="columnLine">time from wall to wall, and twist in midair to strike braced</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another leap. And as I leapt up in that criss-cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion from wall to wall, my heart beating rapidly, put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting all my strength into each great leap, I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marlin on the cell's floor below gazing up tensely through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dusk, knew what depended upon our escape, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled upward with a superhuman strength. Up--up</seg><seg type="columnLine">--back and across--across and back--in leap after slant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing leap upward I progressed, until with a half-dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">more leaps the cell's open top lay close above me. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, though, the energy which I had summoned for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">superhuman feat seemed fast waning, and as I shot from</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall to wall I realized that T was gaining less and less</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the top with each leap!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another leap--another--and as I shot back across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell's width from wall to wall I was aware of the wall's</seg><seg type="columnLine">top but a few yards above me, yet felt at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exhaustion that had gained upon me, now almost near</seg><seg type="columnLine">to overcoming me. Another leap--with agonized mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles I propelled myself back to the opposite wall, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of that wall but a few leet above me. One more</seg><seg type="columnLine">up-slanting leap would take me back up and across to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite wall's top, I knew, but in that tortured</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I felt that I could never make it, and knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I missed it I must inevitably fall downward. So, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck that wall feet-foremost, I put the last of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength into a great effort and shot floatingly across</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlie cell's width for the last time. And this time, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands outstretched, I struck the top edge of that opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, fumbled with it for an agonizing moment, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grasped it and had drawn myself up on the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall's top!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment I lay across its top, oblivious to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">else in the exhaustion that possessed me, inhaling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaling great panting breaths. Then as I drew myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNIVERSE WRECKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">279</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">up a little I peered about me. Far away on all sides of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me stretched the walls of the compartment-city that</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered all of Triton, those wall's tops intersecting like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great checkerboard, and all level with the thick wall's</seg><seg type="columnLine">top on which I lay. Twilight lay over a broad band of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that compartment-city about me, the twilight band be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the dark and sunward sides, the brighter day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunward side stretching away to one side, humming</seg><seg type="columnLine">with activity and with many cylinders moving to and fro</seg><seg type="columnLine">above it, while to the other side stretched the silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping dark side, beneath its unchanging night. Now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed down through the dusk toward the cell's floor far</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath, and saw Marlin gazing up toward me anxiously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestured silently to him. And in a moment more he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming up toward me by the same great zig-zag leaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">from wall to wall that I bad used.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In anxious suspense I watched him as he came grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually up toward me, shooting from side to side oi the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell in upward-slanting leaps that brought him each many</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet upward. Gradually, though, I saw that the force of •</seg><seg type="columnLine">his leaps was lessening, his upward progress slowing, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, too, began to feel the waning of his strength. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, older than myself as he was, those leaps were telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Marlin even more than they had done against me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in utmost suspense I watched as he came more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more slowly toward me. At last he was but a score or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more feet beneath, his face tense and strained as he shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">from wall to wall, gaining now but a few feet each leap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With clenched fingers I watched him, powerless to help,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him by a last gathering of his strength making an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other up-slanting leap and another and another, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">,but one more was needed to reach up to the wall on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I crouched. And even as Marlin made that last</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap, even as he shot across the cell's width and up</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the wall on which I crouched, I realized with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill of horror that he had leaped short 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that moment, as Marlin shot across the cell's width</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward me with hands outstretched, I saw his white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained face and knew that even as I did he realized</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">End of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the shortness of the leap that he had made with his last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strength, realized that his outstretched hands would miss</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the wall's lop by feet. Thai moment in which he shot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">across the cell, as his own hands struck the smooth wall of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">length, yet as he. shot toward me it was more by instinct</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than by conscious thought that I acted. Swiftly hook-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing my knees over the wall's top upon which I crouched,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I	hung with head and body downward into the cell,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reached downward with hands open, and as Marlin shot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">across the cell, as his own hands struck the smooth wall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of it many feet below the top, I reached and grasped them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tightly. A moment thus we hung there, he held by my own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down-swinging body, and then holding his own hand by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one of mine I reached upward wilh the other, drew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">myself slowly and with an infinite effort upward. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">another moment I had drawn myself and Marlin on to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the wall's top, and there crouched with him again in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">silence of exhaustion for the moment. Only his and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my own lessened weight, on Triton, had made it possible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for me thus to save him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For but a moment we crouched there, ihen raised our-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">selves and looked quickly around us. Cylinders were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moving to and fro from time to time over the com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">partments of the twilight band, from the sunward side,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and we knew that if we remained upon the wall's top</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long we would inevitably be discovered. We must de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scend into one of the compartments as swiftly as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But into which one? In an endeavor to solve the ques-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion, we began to crawl quietly along the top of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wall, gazing down upon its other side as we did so. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">compartment on that other side was a cell like our own,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and it was empty; but its only egress was into the hall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">between the ccll-rows, and that was guarded by the Nep-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tunian armed guards.

It is most modestly stated</seg><seg type="columnLine">later on in the hook that Hugo's mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed induced the Germans to give up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgust and sign the Armistice.
