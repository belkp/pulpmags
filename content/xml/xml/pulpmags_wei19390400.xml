            <seg type="columnLine">a feeble but undeniable blue. Mentally</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he compared it to deep, still water,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Jager remembered the flames that once</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">figures. They were human, at least</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they were upright; and they stood in a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">grossly thick, the other thin as an ex-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">clamation point. The line moved, bent,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">formed a weaving circle which spread</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Now the circle was moving, rolling</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The ground was bare except for</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Some high stalks of grass, killed but</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">hand with a stroke of his saber. Again</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he reflected that there had been six</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">forms treading so strange a measure</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">yonder. He began to crawl forward</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> But the two that had stood separate</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the six were not to be seen any-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Jager began to fancy that his first far</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">strange about that pair of dark forms,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">something inhuman or sub-human.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Then a shot rang out, clear and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Jager almost rose into plain view in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the moonlight, but fell flat a mo-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had they not all turned in the direction</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whence the shots'had sounded. Jager</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heard voices, a murmur of them with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nothing that sounded like articulate</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">words. He made bold to rise on his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hands for a closer look. The six fig-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ures were moving eastward, as though</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to investigate.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Jager lifted himself to hands and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knees, then rose to a crouch. He ran</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forward, drawing his gun as he did so.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The great uneven shaft that was Fear-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">which he plunged gratefully, and a mo-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ment later he was at the edge of the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> From that pit rose the diluted blue</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">radiance that seemed to involve this</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">found the light similar to that given</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">off by rotten wood, or fungi, or certain</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brands of lucifer matches. It was like</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an echo of light, he pondered rather</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">absently, and almost grinned at his</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He listened, peered about, then be-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">heard, and a loud, defiant yell that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sounded like Lanark; then an answer-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing burst of laughter, throaty and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">muffled, that seemed to come from sev-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Yet there was no doubt as to which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">way lay his duty. He skirted the open</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">where the six things had formed their</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">thrusting its hairy, fishy-white face at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him. With dark rage swelling his every</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> "It won't die," Lanark murmured</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> At the same instant he knew that still</seg>
