            <seg type="columnLine">UNLIKE stepping out with a camera and taking shots of locomotives, etc., the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">railroad postage-stamp hobby requires much patience. Usually you wait and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hope--wait until a friend happens to send you one of the coveted specimens, and then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hope he will find more. That is, unless you can afford to buy them direct from dealers.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Some collectors trade photos for stamps. You find such notices occasionally in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the columns of our International Engine Picture Club. It is advisable to get a stand-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ard catalog giving the value of stamps in all countries, in order to make fair exchanges.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">For instance, the 2c. U. S. stamp of 1901 showing the Empire State Express printed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upside down is worth $2,700. The 3c. U. S. stamp of 1869 showing a 4-4-0 type loco-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">motive is valued at 8c. If you give anyone the former stamp in exchange for the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">latter you lose exactly $2,699.92.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">perfectly. Never paste down your stamps; use the common transparent hinges. If</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">possible, save money by getting your philatelic supplies through a stamp club in your</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">own town. Some members offer railroad stamps in trade or at low cost. They</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">will tell you about various specimens. For instance, the Canadian National Railways</seg>
