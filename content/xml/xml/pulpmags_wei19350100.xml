            <seg type="columnLine">starveling boy, gave succor to Narthos</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and sheltered him. He dwelt for years</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with Ouphaloc, becoming the wizard's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pupil and the hdr of his demon-wrested</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lore. Strange things he learned in that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hermitage, being fed on fruits and grain</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that had sprung not from the watered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">earth, and wine that was not the juice of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">became a master in devildom and drove</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his own bond with the archfiend Thasai-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">don. When Ouphaloc died, he took the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">name of Namirrha, and went forth as a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mighty sorcerer among the wandering</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">peoples and the deep-buried mummies of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the wrong he had endured from Zotulla;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and year by year he spun over in his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">his fame grew ever darker and vaster, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">men feared him in remote lands beyond</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Tasuun. With bated whispers they spoke</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in Zul-Bha-Sair, the abode of the ghoul-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">seen; but a howling as of the damned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was sometimes heard to issue from his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">portals; and sometimes there came a stony</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cachinnation, as if some adamantine</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">image had laughed aloud; and sometimes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there was a chuckling like the sound of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shattered ice in a frozen hell. Dim</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shadows moved in the porticoes when</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there was neither sunlight nor lamp to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and vanished in the windows at eve, like</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a blinking of demoniac eyes. And slowly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the ember-colored suns went over Xylac,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and were quenched in far seas; and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ashy moons were blackened as they fell</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nightly toward the hidden gulf. Then,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seeing that the wizard had wrought no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">open evil, and that none had endured</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">palpable harm from his presence, the peo-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and feasted in oblivious luxury as before;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and dark Thasaidon, prince of all turpi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tudes, was the true but never-acknowl-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">men of Ummaos bragged a little of Na-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">as they had boasted of the purple sins of</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But Namirrha, still unbeheld by living</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">men and living women, sat in the inner</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">halls of that house which his devils had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in his thoughts the black web of revenge.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">And in all Ummaos there was none,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">even among his fellow-beggars, who re-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">wrong done by Zotulla to Narthos in old</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time was the least of those cruelties which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the emperor had forgotten.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Now, when the fears of Zotulla were</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">gossiped less often of the neighboring</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wizard, there occurred a new wonder and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a fresh terror. For, sitting one eve at his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">banquet-table with his courtiers about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him, the emperor heard a noise as of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">myriad iron-shod hooves that came tramp-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ling through the palace-gardens. And the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">courtiers also heard the sound, and were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">startled amid their mounting drunken-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ness; and the emperor was angered, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he sent certain of his guards to examine</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into the cause of the trampling. But peer-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing forth upon the moon-bright lawns</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and parterres, the guards beheld no visi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ble shape, though the loud sounds of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trampling still went to and fro. It seemed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as if a rout of wild stallions passed and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">re-passed before the facade of the palace</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with tumultuous gallopings and capri-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">coles. And a fear came upon the guards as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they looked and listened; and they dared</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not venture forth, but returned to Zotulla.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">And the emperor himself grew sober</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when he heard their tale; and he went</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forth with high blusterings to view the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">rang out sonorously on the pavements of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">onyx, and ran with deep thuddings over</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">lilies and broad-petaled exotic blossoms</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were trodden under. And rage and ter-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ror nested together in Zotulla's heart as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he stood in a balcony above the garden,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">eunuchs cowered behind him, and there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was no slumber for any occupant of the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> When the dawn was full-grown above</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ummaos, the emperor walked forth with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his guards about him, and saw that the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crushed grasses and broken-down stems</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were blackened as if by fire where the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hooves had fallen. Plainly were the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">marks imprinted, like the tracks of a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">great company of horses, in all the lawns</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and parterres; but they ceased at the verge</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the gardens. And though every one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">believed that the visitation had come</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from Namirrha, there was no proof of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this in the grounds that fronted the sor-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cerer's abode; for here the turf was un-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trodden.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "A pox upon Namirrha, if he has</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">done this!" cried Zctulla. "For what</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">harm have I ever done to him? Verily, I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shall set my heel on the dog's neck; and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the torture-wheel shall serve him even as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">these horses from hell have served my</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blood-red lilies of Sotar and my vein-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">colored irises of Naat and my orchids</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from Uccastrog which were purple as the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the viceroy of Thasaidon above Earth,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and overlord of ten thousand devils, my</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">till he withers black as the seared blos-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">soms." Thus did Zotulla make his brag;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but he isstied no orders for the execution</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the threat; and no man stirred from</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> the palace toward Namirrha's house. And</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the portals of the wizard none came</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forth; or if any came, there was no visible</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So the day went over, and the night</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rose, bringing later a moon that was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slightly darkened at the rim. And the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">night was silent; and Zotulla, sitting long</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at the banquet-table, drained his wine-cup</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">often and wrathfully, muttering new</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">threats against Namirrha. And the night</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wore on, and it seemed that the visita-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">night, lying in his chamber with Obexah,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and fathom-deep in slumber from his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wine, Zotulla was awakened by a mon-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">strous clangor of hooves that raced and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">capered in the palace porticoes and in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">long balconies. All night the hooves</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thundered back and forth, echoing awful-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ly in the vaulted stone, while Zotulla and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Obexah, listening, huddled close amid</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their cushions and coverlets; and all the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">occupants of the palace, wakeful and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fearful, heard the noise but stirred not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from their chambers. A little before</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dawn the hooves departed suddenly; and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">afterward, by day, their marks were found</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the marble flags of the porches and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">balconies; and the marks were countless,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">deep-graven, and black as if branded</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Like mottled marble were the emper-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">till dawn, the hooves filled the palace</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with their iron clatterings, and they rang</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hollowly on the topmost domes, as if the</seg>
