The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side of the ridge was open in places</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the crest all the way down; in others</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was impassable because of burned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not an Indian was in sight; but from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen points the signal smokes were slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising.	f</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Below and five miles away three wagons</seg><seg type="columnLine">were burning.

An arrow cut through that sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porting left arm and stuck in the grassy bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">where an instant before had rested Mason's</seg><seg type="columnLine">back.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian's pony, shot squarely in the chest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reared and fell backward, crushing its rider</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the shoulder of the rider was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged bullet-hole.

The three shots al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready fired were still echoing afar. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">a red ear was keyed to catch any that might</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow.

He grabbed the long black hair in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left hand. He jerked back the Ute's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. His knife slashed a long, deep cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the stretched throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like the spring of the blood-snake, the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife again cut into the quivering Indian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a cry, the Indian flung the white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his back, and made a titanic bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the woods. In mid-air he collapsed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">died. Striking the ground, the body rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over on its back. To make assurance doubly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, Mason placed his foot down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeking neck, and stuck the knife into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian's breast. But the red heart was still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not waiting an instant, Mason pulled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blade and made for the Indian's pony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To let it escape would be fatal.

Here it was swaying and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to drink. Running with his knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">held at arm's length like a rapier, Mason</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged it into the pony's side just behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With a grunt, the horse sank to its knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rolled once on its side. Then it raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">its head in a wild, dumb appeal to the man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It tried to rise. It uttered an almost human</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry for mercy. The great, dark eyes looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Mason with hurt surprise. That look</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunts him yet. Blood gushed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose and mouth. The head drooped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell. The horse was dead. Mason dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tears from his eyes and choked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your life or mine, my dumb brother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it has to be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was no time for regret.

Striding to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead Indian, Mason dragged the body by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hair to the water's edge, and flung it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, into the snowy, rushing current.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The water caught the corpse and tore it</seg><seg type="columnLine">along among the rocks and logs.

He knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">414</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere above him on the ridge, either</seg><seg type="columnLine">far or near, to right or left, Indians were</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the lookout. At the upper edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber, Mason paused, still hidden. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied Rattler within a dense thicket, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped to one side and a little to the front,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the trees were thinner, and scanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bare ridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Along the side of that ridge, an Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">horseman was coming at a fast lope. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was some three hundred yards away, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">was riding rapidly yet cautiously, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping a keen watch on the woods below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mason rested his cocked rifle in the fork</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a dead sapling and waited. The Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">came nearer, and still nearer. Mason's</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath came and went, hissing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Indian was only a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Mason looked at him through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sights. Too far. To miss meant Mason's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. If the coming Ute kept to the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was following, Mason saw that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass within fifty feet of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hundred feet away the trail, to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rock, ran for about thirty feet straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the pine behind which stood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">statue-like white man. Mason saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this would give him a straight-away shot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">•The Indian pony came loping along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail. Sixty feet more, and either an Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a white man must die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pony swung round the curve and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came leaping along the straight bit of trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one hundred feet away. The Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">died. The riderless pony snorted, whirled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bolted back up the trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mason darted to the fallen Indian. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore from the struggling body the long red</seg><seg type="columnLine">head-dress of eagle feathers. Running back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmindful of his arm, he jerked Rattler</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose, vaulted into the saddle, and spurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cow-horse up the hill, clinging to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trophies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a quarter of a mile from the tim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber's edge to the crest of the ridge. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner did the white man get into the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bare mountain-side, than far below</seg><seg type="columnLine">him angry shots began to crack and roar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mason heard them and distant singing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lead behind and below him, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft spat-spot-spug of the bullets in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber. He dismounted near the crest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ridge and, walking, let Rattler gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath for a quick dash over the top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the horse and his rider were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the top that Mason could see down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side, he paused a moment to 'survey</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the scene. Nothing hostile was in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Behind and below him all was silent and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">serene, but a murmur was dying among the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cliffs, and smoke was floating among the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tree-tops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Hoping to look as much like an Indian</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as possible, Mason, after first blindfolding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Rattler with his handkerchief, donned the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trailing Indian head-dress and the red</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blanket. Mounting, he reached forward,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slipped the bandage from Rattler's eyes,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and with it waved a derisive farewell to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">invisible redskins below. A few satanic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yells came faintly up. Then, at an easy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gallop,-the feathers and blanket flying in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the wind, Mason crossed the open ridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He stood a fair chance to escape. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slanting side of the ridge had prevented any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sound of his recent troubles from getting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over the crest. He laughed nervously, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a thrill he had never known before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Though hard on Rattler's knees and shoul-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ders, Mason urged the horse down the dan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gerous ridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Suddenly, from the bushes fifty feet ahead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and slightly to the left, an Indian arose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The mongrel dress Mason wore, half white,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">half red, together with his tanned face and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">black hair, deceived the Indian for an in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stant, for every buck in the red camp was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wearing pieces of white man's and white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman's apparel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Ute who stood in the bushes wore a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">battered yet still shiny silk hat, a clean</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white shirt, worn with the starched bosom</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">behind and with the tails free, while knot-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ted around his vast paunch was a pair of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman's striped stockings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Over all hung a dirty green blanket. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Indian was drunk. Otherwise his vanity</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would not thus have overcome his natural</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caution when on the war-trail. At the sight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of this comical yet hideous and dangerous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">apparition, Rattler snorted, reared, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">struck the earth with all four legs stiff and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">braced. Anyone but a born rider would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have pitched headlong over the horse's head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and down the hillside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Whip! The white man's revolver flashed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" from its holster as the pony snorted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bang! The shot went rolling along the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mountain-side and down a little, narrow,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crooked canon to the right. The Ute</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whirled, gave a grunt, clasped both hands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over'his stomach, doubled up, belched forth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a drunken hiccup, plunged forward on his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">head, flopped a somersault down the slope,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shuddered, and died.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MASON, THE GRIZZLY.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">415</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another minute, and Mason was out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight in the rocky defile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But over the top of the ridge plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">three Indian horsemen, yelling like mad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their eyes caught the last flash of that red</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket going down the gulch. With tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphant shrieks, they shot down the ridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into the canon in straight pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white man was trapped. Behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him tore three of the bravest and most skil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful warriors of the Ute nation. Ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was the Indian camp. Escape up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall-like sides of the canon was impossible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The smaller canon entered the larger defile</seg><seg type="columnLine">just above the point where clustered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian teepees. The chasing horsemen be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind were firing rifles as a warning to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">in camp ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quiet reigned among the teepees. Know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing well their position, and that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded by scouts both far and near, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the skin tents were careless of dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger. Suddenly came the alarm. Distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots and shrieks and the beating of flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoofs, multiplied by the cafion echoes, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a thunderous battle-crash roaring down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pass, and stampeding the lazy camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yelling bucks and squaws, followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their whimpering young, went bounding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling, sneaking up the sides of the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon and hid among the rocks. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence dropped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The camp and the canon seemed deserted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but among the rocks slunk three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild men and women, waiting in an ambush</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the expected cavalry charge of the sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diers. Beady, soaky eyes were focused on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail that disappeared around the bend</seg><seg type="columnLine">not far above. Inferno was booming down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Around the bend tore a great bay horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild-eyed and frantic. His neck, back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying tail were in line. His hoofs threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravel and stones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over the 'saddle-horn bent the rider.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Around him, the ends flopping in the wind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a red blanket. Straight out behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him trailed the feather head-dress. In each</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand was a cocked six-shooter. Behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a similar horseman, and another, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the second horseman whirled around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bend, shots rang out, but dust obscured</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coming route. The Indians skulking</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the canon-sides thought that the shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fired to alarm the camp, or else at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuing foe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Click-click-click sounded the cocking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles along the canon-side. An arrow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted to every bow-string. Dark, subtle</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances shot from the band up the canon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the race below, then back to the bend above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the camp plunged the horseman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thunder of the hoofs and the shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">yells mingled into a roar. The second rider</seg><seg type="columnLine">had emptied his rifle and was reloading as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as a man might on the back of a -run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning horse. One shot at the scarlet figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of him would be understood by those</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, and a volley would end the race.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But his guns were empty, his cues were</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned, and he did not carry bow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third and fourth rider dared not</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot, for the trail was straight, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second rider thus protected the hunted one</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lead. The white man did not fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him, for to do so would bring a rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death from the rocks above. Mason</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew safety lay only in the eagle feathers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red blanket, his black hair, tanned face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Rattler's hoofs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only fifty feet away around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of rock ahead. The camp was passed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The second rider had slipped a cartridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his pounding rifle. He dropped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">reins, jerked his gun to his shoulder, raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rifle, and fired at the flying rider ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Indian missed. Mason ducked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, threw back his right arm, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">inverted revolver answered back. From a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunging horse bullets fly straighter out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a revolver than from a rifle. The Ute and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pony rolled in a kicking heap together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Consternation swept along the caiion-sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">--then a blast of fury. The end horseman</seg><seg type="columnLine">reined up. With a motion of the sign-lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage, he signaled to those lurking above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly the canon became a volcano. Fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smoke, bullets and arrows, war-clubs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stones, burst from behind every rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down went Rattler. Down went Mason.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both lay still. One was dead--the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned.

An Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy bounded down the rocks. He halted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He jerked an arrow to his ear. An older</seg><seg type="columnLine">man stretched the bow; the arrow whistled</seg><seg type="columnLine">away over the tree-tops. An Indian girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled a stone down at the still, upturned</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. The jagged piece of granite splin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered on the. rock beside the white temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Colorow, war chief of the Ute nation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped astride the captive, flung away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">416</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white man's weapons; dropped his blanket</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over the outstretched form, stood -erect, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">raised his rifle threateningly.

Standing up, knee-deep in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the current, he gazed stupidly at the laugh-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing Indians. Then the situation flashed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon him. Like a corraled buffalo bull,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he started here and there, only to realize</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that escape was impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Reason and coolness came. The superior</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mind of the white man must save him if he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is to be saved at all. Mason, with forced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">calmness, scooped up a double handful of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">water and drank. This he did again and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again, thinking like lightning. He squeezed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the water from his hair and brushed it back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. out of his eyes; felt to see if his water-tight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pouch containing tobacco and matches was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">safe.

Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">their close association on the foot - plate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and harmonious intercourse in general,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their friendship had come to imply much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than the common acceptance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">term. In fact, so high was the esteem in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the engineer was held by Miller that'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter steadily refused promotion that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might continue as his fireman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus matters stood when Miller was at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked with brain-fever and hurried to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital. Graham made a number of trips</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an extra fireman, and no doubt would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done so on the fated day had he not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the previous night, dreamed vividly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellow worker was at death's door. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching himself for the neglect which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had exhibited, he arranged for his run to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be covered, and hurried to the hospital, ta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king with him his own physician, Dr. J.

For the first time in many hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">his delirium assumed the form of coherent</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech, and in a ringing voice, which start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">led the entire ward, came the words: "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">are three minutes late! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thinking the case had assumed a crisis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Moore hurried to administer whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief might be possible.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">train left three minutes late; it was two</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes late at Morristown, and met the</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight about three miles beyond. The crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the latter, with orders to run ahead of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">following passenger - train, completely lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the fast express thundering to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and stopped at Harden to take wa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter.

He called on Mr. Jack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and delicately made the request to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the body in the coffin was really a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpse. Mr. Jackson was inclined to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">indignant, but a natural worry led him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompany Ruggles to the undertaker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There they looked at the thin gray face</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the white hair of Mr. Jackson's dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dead was left alone in the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taker's room with other silent dead, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruggles left St. Louis sadly puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned to his home city, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting moodily in his office by nightfall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Let's see," muttered Ruggles, time after</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, "perhaps Morrison and the messenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in with each other and are working a</seg><seg type="columnLine">game.

At two</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock that day he received a telegram from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railroad authorities saying that three</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of hand-baggage were also missing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the express-baggage car.

At this point the tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Erie, the Pennsylvania and the B.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and O. interlace, and there is no little con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion of tracks, switches and crossovers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An engineer named Cummings was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of the 7269 which was pulling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger-train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">No Time to Stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cummings received his signal to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead and the heavy train moved down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crossover.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlight was swaying from side to side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and steam hissed from the battered boiler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the heavy locomotive took the curve at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the station, her drivers biting into the rails</seg><seg type="columnLine">and throwing out a steady stream of sparks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though it had not been many minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the passenger-train was cut in two at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Crab Creek crossing, messages were</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing all along the line for every one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look out for the runaway.

He was handsome--but for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paleness of his face, and the sad expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of his eyes. That he was ill at ease</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plainly evident. On several occasions</seg><seg type="columnLine">he started, gave a glance toward the sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each time that he did so he breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sigh of keen disappointment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Occasionally, he would glance toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottage, but no one seemed visible there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he would sweep the front stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean with his gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The sun was just sinking, and even while</seg><seg type="columnLine">it- last ray# lingered upon land and ocean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a black cloud was gathering in the northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. Observing this, a shadow passed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of this man, and he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is a storm brewing, and if so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Moreland may not reach us to-night. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm brewing! Yes, for me and my loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones, I feel that there is, and that its burst-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing will be terrible. Must I 'ever suffer this</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony of mind? Why will he thus follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">me? Is it not enough that I have retired</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the world, and no longer bear his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name? I would be happy with my wife</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and children, but for this dread which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever hanging over me. If I could tell her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might relieve me; but, no--I have de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived my wife, and I must endure alone."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He relapsed into silence again. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not observed the approach of other parties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While he had been speaking, there emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the. cottage a woman, leading by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand two little girls dressed in white. Soft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly they came forward, as if to surprise the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaker; but his last words were heard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman suddenly stopped, while an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of anxiety passed over her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The children bounded to the man's side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, in chorus, exclaimed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " See, papa, we are ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man arose to his feet, and fixing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes upon the woman, he appeared trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read her thoughts. It was evident from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her manner that something had affected her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blanche, did you hear my words?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did, Herman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The answer was given slowly, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman appeared to dwell upon the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, as if she would convey some especial</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning by doing so. This was observed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the question asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you hear me speak of having de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived you, Blanche?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Why do you dwell upon that last word</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such peculiar emphasis?

Will you explain?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The woman came forward and encircled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's neck with her arms. She gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up into his eyes, while tears glistened in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own. Then, in a sweet and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleading voice, she said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Herman, for five years my happiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been almost complete.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What has come over you, you act so</seg><seg type="columnLine">queerly ?

Several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">of late my attention has been attracted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sudden appearance and disappearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a stranger.

I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">very little of the matter--not even enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make mention of it to you. But--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Go on, Blanche."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " But a few moments ago I was standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">by my-window, when suddenly I felt my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm grasped. I was somewhat startled, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">still more so when a voice whispered my</seg><seg type="columnLine">name. At the same time a letter was thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my hand.

When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">company mascot, Army Jack, a white bull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog, died, Captain Mix attended his fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neral.

We walked our horses, and each</seg><seg type="columnLine">man removed or made fast all trappings</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would make a noise. Several of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men tore strips from their blankets or from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower part of their blouses, and passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them along to the others to tie between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside of the bit and the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been my imagination, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I could hear men talking in whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers. I knew that it would not be good</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold the troop in that uncertain posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion very long, and was wondering what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man would do next, when a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">horseman rode down our front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was startled.

He accepted it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">as calmly as the oldest veteran on the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll run you pretty light," I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by way of sympathy.

Dill finally pretends that he is about to make restitution, but by a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">strategy fires his revolver, grapples with his ward, and, when the police rush in, hands Graham over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as a robber and assassin. He conceals the diary, which is the sole proof of his own guilt. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a case of one man's word against another's. Dill, who has dabbled in politics, manages to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham prosecuted before a judge whom he put in office. The -Jlrtist is found guilty and sentenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to five years' imprisonment. During Graham's first month in the penitentiary, he is visited by Dill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is anxious to learn the attitude of his former ward toward himself and find out whether he intends</seg><seg type="columnLine">to even up the score on his release. He tells Graham that he has placed the incriminating diary in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe-deposit vault and tries to draw him out, but as Graham refuses to utter a single word, he goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">away unrewarded. The prisoner chafes at the monotony of his existence, and his sense of justice cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">out at the cruelties which he sees being practised about him and learns of from his cell-mate, Piano,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who proves to be very much of a philosopher. Piano finally escapes, leaving Graham to bear his</seg><seg type="columnLine">misery alone. After four years of imprisonment, Graham is finally given his liberty.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced cigars, and for the first time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than four eternal years Graham tasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">good tobacco. The contrast between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed " state," as prison - weed is</seg><seg type="columnLine">called, and real Cuban leaf, filled him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an almost childish content.

The look in Piano's curious eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a trifle disconcerting, as was also the</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious gusto with which, once started, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked about his exploits. Graham felt re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved when a hand turned the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking compartment, and a mahogany</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, surmounted by a porter's cap, peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Half pas' one, gemmen," announced an</seg><seg type="columnLine">African voice.

But long after Piano</seg><seg type="columnLine">was contentedly dreaming, Graham lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-eyed in the darkness of his berth--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which somehow reminded him terribly of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison-bunk--listening to the stuffy night</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds in the sleeper, the swish-swish of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curtains, and the clattering music of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels upon the metal. He was thinking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, of all that he had heard; wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">feverishly about all that, for weal or wo, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future held for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The " Swell Mob."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TT may seem strange, pausing now 011 the</seg><seg type="columnLine">-*• threshold of Graham's new life, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man should have needed so much hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience of present-day law and order;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much thought, reading, and persuasion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before abandoning once for all the meth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ods of conventionality, before definitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing in his lot with the only men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could now help him win his own. Yet you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must remember that Graham was no ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary fellow, of vague or formless prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciples; that all his life he had been trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to believe, had been nurtured all through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boyhood, all through his college days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as is the custom of colleges, in the faith</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the bases of society are just, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">abstract principles of right determine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual working-out of the world's problems.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hence it was that even at the very last</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he still hesitated, beating about for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some hand-hold of belief, some footing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope that there perhaps might be some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other way. Only when he had come to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nothing else remained save to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">law unto himself, to reverse by personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">action the verdict rendered through perjury</seg><seg type="columnLine">and guile--only then, with a clear con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">science, did he face his own soul, and real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ize that if right were ever to be his. it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">come through what the world calls wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In company with Piano', who advised him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now to let his heard and mustache grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">for greater safety, he met, next morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two members of the "mob" in which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had at last decided to enlist himself as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprentice. He had once read in a highlv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored magazine article a description of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a yeggman's "dump" or hang-out. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">had led him to expect, perhaps, some disor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derly den on the East Side, in an attic or</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellar--a dark room littered with tools,</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty bottles, begging-cards, and cigar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">12 RR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">butts, the walls hung with ragged clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air foul and dank. It came rather as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, then, when Piano ushered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into well-kept bachelor apartments, reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an elevator, on the fifth floor of a house</seg><seg type="columnLine">in One Hundred and Sixth Street, not many</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors west of the park.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Welcome to our home, sweet home,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Piano hospitably, closing the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">door behind them. He whistled softly. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">step sounded in the hall. Graham turned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toward him he saw advancing a tall, erect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine-looking -man, with a thoughtful and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep-lined face--a man whose forehead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and intellectual; whose beard, parted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle and brushed away sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward either side, gave him the air of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">respected and substantial banker, broker, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Here's Switch, at last," said Piano,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a smile. " Switch, shake hands, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam. You'll get on famously together, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, even though you may not always</seg><seg type="columnLine">agree on matters of theory. Don't argue</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Adam, whatever you do," he added</seg><seg type="columnLine">jestingly to Graham. " I warn you, now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there isn't one of us can floor him on logic."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The older man gave no heed to this sally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but extended a fine and strong hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I'm glad to see you," said he quite sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply, with a nicked German accent. "Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I take your hat, so." He waved toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room at the front end of the hallway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piano led the newcomer thither. Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham found himself in a comfortable sitting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. His first glance showed him book-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases, a morris-chair or two, a table cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with magazines and papers. In one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chairs another man was sitting, smok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a long-stemmed, tasselled pipe. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man rose to greet him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As, again introduced by Piano, Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook hands with Tumbler, he noted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's trim side-whiskers, somewhat bald</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and well-moulded mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down," said Tumbler pleasantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though with a sharp and steady look. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated a chair, then shoved a box of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigars toward Graham; who, to relieve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">embarrassment that had got hold on him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took one and lighted it. He sat down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed his legs, looked from one to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other of the men, and--finding nothing per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinent to say--said nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his self-consciousness lasted not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute. If he expected to be quizzed or</seg><seg type="columnLine">put through any course of «prouts, pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">562</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointment came at once. Adam looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in through the door just long enough to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuse himself, on the ground that he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave a little experiment he was carrying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the back of the flat, and withdrew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piano and Tumbler fell into an easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation about the base-ball pennant</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospects, then drifted from that to the state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the market, and so to the subject of high</seg><seg type="columnLine">prices. Graham found himself presently-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking a third hand in the talk, just as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have done with any other men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal culture. Half an hour passed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air of the room was gray before so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any mention of " shop " came up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the way, where's Dave?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano, glancing at his watch. " Here it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is almost eleven. I thought he'd be here</seg><seg type="columnLine">before now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dave?" answered the other, dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the curious lingo whereof Graham had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already heard a little from Piano. " Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's out after a little dooley--for to-night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know. Had to go across to Jersey for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, to Donahue's. He said he was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fix things with a 'gager' over there, too;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mandelbaum, I think he said the name was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Powell's getting a bit risky, since the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">office bulls butted in there last week."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right, too," assented Piano, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pocketed his watch again. " Some gabby</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other must have been bawling. Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll find out who, and hand him one yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we're done. Well--no use worrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that. Got the route laid out, drag's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mapped, bait planted, and all ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tumbler nodded, opened a drawer in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, and took out a note-book and a road-</seg><seg type="columnLine">map of southern Connecticut. The map he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread upon the floor. He drew from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket a gold-mounted fountain-pen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced a line irregularly from New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">City to Southbridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This," said he judicially, "is the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can do, taking everything into considera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, state of the roads, various town ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nances about speed, and so forth." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Graham. "Perhaps you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite understand everything as yet," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A drag, that's what we call a street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know; and planting the bait means</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting a line on the building, the gopher--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safe, I mean--the watchmen, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sort of thing. We're going to take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">run out to-night in the machine. Piano's</seg><seg type="columnLine">told you? No? Well, no matter. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">just keep your lamps lit, and by to-morrow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll be a whole lot wiser than you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slid from the chair, knelt and studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the map with scrupulous attention. Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham, an idea occurring to him, turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at Piano with raised eyebrows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" He--he knows about my case ? " whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piano shook his head. " Only me," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered, tapping his breast. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched his' lips. Graham saw again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious, subtle look in Piano's eyes; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered, vaguely, what interest the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have, after all, in thus taking on as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a member of the mob, in thus imitating</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. But though the thought gave him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment's uneasy reflection, he put it away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whatever the motive, come what might,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here he was. That much was certain, any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how. He stood at last on the first round</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ladder of achievement, of revindi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation. Nothing else mattered much. Too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late, now, for any hesitation, any notion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrawal. He looked, while Tumbler's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen indicated an ink-marked spot on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">map.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Here she is," said Tumbler, reflectively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We go in at the east end of the town, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of Hotchkiss Street. Cross the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road. Take the second stem to the left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leave the machine back of the Baptist</seg><seg type="columnLine">Church. Then all we have to do is go</seg><seg type="columnLine">west one block, take the alley running from</seg><seg type="columnLine">High to Wilson, and--get busy. A pipe!</seg><seg type="columnLine">By half-past one we ought to be out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">town again and making things buzz for</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, eh ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked up with a smile. "About to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow morning," he added, " the South-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge National Bank people, and the bulls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ' pencils '--the reporters, you know--</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be having something to speculate about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe there'll be a few thankful bank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers, at that. It happens more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">once," he explained, as in answer to Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham's surprised look, " that a man short in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his accounts welcomes us like we were an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gels of glory. Welcomes us? Why, don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you remember that East Warwick mark we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tipped off to by the cashier?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Saved him from stripes, all right!

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They talked till lunch-time, laying out</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the details of the expected raid. Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham, of course, listened much and said</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, but what he said betrayed a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">perception and so ready an understanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">that both Piano and Tumbler now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then paused to look at him and nod approv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly. At the meal, served in right decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">style in the dining-room by an old, close-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lipped mail whom the new-comer spotted at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once as having done time, Adam thawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and became argumentative. He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to start a discussion of the tariff, but, no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body venturing to oppose him, had to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for very lack of antagonism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conversation swung round to shop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk, after a while, interspersed with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishing profusion of "monicas" or</seg><seg type="columnLine">nicknames in the profession, of technicali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties, and all but incomprehensible expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions. But Graham sat tight, kept his ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, and--what with the use of his brains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what with the occasional explanation that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came his way--began already to feel him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self less a stranger to their thought and life</seg><seg type="columnLine">than when he had entered the flat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward three o'clock that afternoon Dave</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in. He was a short, muscular fellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beardless, and brown-eyed. His appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance suggested that of a well-to-do young</seg><seg type="columnLine">business man. He outlined what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">that morning done: the arrangements he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made with Mandelbaum, the "fence"</seg><seg type="columnLine">or " phony-broker," who, he said, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispose at a fair rate for them of any nego-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiable bonds or papers captured in the forth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming crush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You understand, of course," Piano ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained to Switch, "that we can push out</seg><seg type="columnLine">cash or stamps, ourselves; but when it conies</seg><seg type="columnLine">to paper, then we have to be careful. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">first-class phony-broker is one of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">important things we -have to look out for.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's a dangerous stunt, that sort of thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had a man once who got caught with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle of railroad stocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They got him bang to rights and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have shoved him, only he'd already taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the precaution of putting the stocks on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewalk and stepping on them with a mud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dy boot. So, of course, when he swore he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">found them, they couldn't prove he hadn't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes, naturally we lost the stuff, but, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broker saved his skin, which was some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. See the value of detail? It's just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I told you before--perpetual vigil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, and so forth.

He remembered, too, the rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling sight they showed him in the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen--a pan of hot water steaming on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gas-stove, with half a dozen yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticks of dynamite lying at the bottom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamite which Dave had brought from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jersey City, where he had purchased it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his contractor friend, Donahue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " That's the way we make our ' soup '</seg><seg type="columnLine">or ' grease ' or 1 sap ' or ' oil,' whichever you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to call it," Dave explained.

Piano</seg><seg type="columnLine">slackened speed and turned off the lights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thereafter they trundled along at a slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">jog, meeting nobody save once a belated</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmer with a frightened horse that ran him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the ditch. He swore violently at them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they replied not even by a laugh or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jibe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Cautiously they crept into the town. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there a window still showed its square-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panecl patch of illumination, but for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part the place seemed wrapped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. The street-lights, few and feeble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did no more than cast faint rays across their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Down one side-street Graham saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitary and dejected-looking policeman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this guardian of the peace did not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much as notice their noiseless passage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They followed closely the route laid down</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them by Tumbler. Graham, with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing nervousness, took note of every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--the railroad crossing, the entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the second street to the left, then the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">big, white church with its tall pillars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its scjuare spire fading eerily up into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Unseen, the car trundled into the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">space beside the church, turned and stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind it, out of sight of the street. Adam</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed out first, then Piano. Dave de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended very carefully, holding his hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breast where lay the flask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " All right, you now! " whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tumbler to Graham. He, too, got out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Twelve-fifteen," he heard Piano say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fine and dandy!" Then Tumbler</seg><seg type="columnLine">added, "Here, come now, take these!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed out first the suit-case, then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satchel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently the five men, under cover of</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, had one by one issued out onto</seg><seg type="columnLine">High Street, through an alley. Not a soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in sight. " Hold that gun ready,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered Piano. " I've got one, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't wait a minute in case of trouble, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw it into John Law for all you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rapidly and silently as specters they</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned do\vn another unlighted alley, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing the lead of Tumbler. Graham,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining his eyes, could make out vaguely</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark forms of the yeggmen. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tumbler went "Stttt!" and Graham saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little white circle of light fall on some</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron bars. He perceived, then, that Tum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bler held an electric flash-lamp. By its</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly-reflected light he saw the dim, eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces of the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The spreader, here!" he heard Piatio</seg><seg type="columnLine">say in an undertone. Somebody was kneel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the mud. Came a click, as the suit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">case opened. Then the electric flash showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curious apparatus being adjusted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars. All that Graham could see was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">this tiling and a pair of hands at work; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect was uncanny. He shivered slightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the drizzling closeness of the night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but only gripped his " cannon " more tight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "Stick and slug!" the motto came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind. He waited, breathlessly, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the work at the barred window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spreader, he saw, was a combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of simplicity and marvelous force, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most ingenious and useful tools im-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">aginable. As nearly as he could make out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it consisted of a solid steel screw with two</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip-nuts of steel at one end and a massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">hub-shaped nut in the middle. This hub</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pierced with holes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw hands adjust the thing so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one end rested against the masonry window-</seg><seg type="columnLine">566</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jamb while the other engaged a thick verti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold 'er!" commanded Piano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Other hands held the thing in place;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a strong and heavy lever was slid home</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one of die holes. Graham saw the lever</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning the hub-like nut. The spreader</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengdiened. " All right now," whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano. "Just keep a light on here, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll have things loose in a jiffy! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He withdrew the lever, put it again into</seg><seg type="columnLine">another hole, and again pulled it down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus, one hole by one, he turned the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">nut. The bar began to bend. Braced</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it was, above and below, by trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse irons, the metal had to yield. Steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">round and round went the nut; steadily the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar bellied out. All at onee, Snap! it</seg><seg type="columnLine">went. Graham saw that it had been pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean in two, about three inches from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">insertion into the stone-work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jove! " thought he. "What chance has</seg><seg type="columnLine">any bar got against that? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly two minutes later another bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">was broken, and both had been bent up</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During this time Adam had opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satchel, had taken out and screwed together</seg><seg type="columnLine">a high-grade steel sectional jimmy, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now prepared to force the window, inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jimmy bit. A hand put a pebble</seg><seg type="columnLine">under it. for a fulcrum. Adam and Tum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bler threw their weight onto its outer end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Dave--with the rubber bottle in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket--stood back out of harm's way. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch snapped. The sash went up. Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham caught his breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Flash the glim in there! " whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano. The little white light glinted here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, showing an office with heavy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">old-fashioned furniture. By the vague re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flection Graham caught a little spark of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light from a revolver in Dave's hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, boys!" he heard Adam say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here, Dave, giff me de oil!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As had been previously arranged, Tum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bler and Dave were to be the " outside men,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving Adam and Piano for the inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. Graham, too, was to accompany</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, not only as a guard, but also because</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano had insisted on giving him a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn the game--a game which the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally, already understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, Graham realized, the moment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now come when for the first time in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life he was to enter, without warrant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">permission or law, the property of other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">men; when for the first time he was to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the actual working of experienced yeggs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He forgot almost to breathe. The excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the game was on him; his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared through the gloom; in his ears he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the blood-stream rushing fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Easily, quiedy, Adam peered in, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid a leg over the sill, stooped through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, drew his other leg in, and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiselessly to the floor. He reached out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from Dave took the rubber flask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You next!" said Piano. Graham clam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered after Adam, while Tumbler lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way for him with the flash-lamp. Last</seg><seg type="columnLine">came Piano. Tumbler handed him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Give us twenty minutes," said Piano,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and we're with you. Shoot if you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to; but first, diplomacy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on, go on!" answered Tumbler.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What d'you think I am? A fritzer?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piano made no reply, but, pointing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little beam of light this way and that, ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced on noiseless, soft-shod feet across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You, Switch," he continued, "be ready!</seg><seg type="columnLine">If we run into the watchman, there'll be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">muss, sure. Take-a hand! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They reached a door, at the left. Adam</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Locked, off course," said he. Piano</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed the light into the satchel; the Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man chose a long-nosed pair of key-nippers</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hollowed-out jaws. Deftly he manip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulated this in the keyhole, seized the stub</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the key and gently turned it. A moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later the door swung clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Piano flashed the light inside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peeked through--an anxious moment, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, for every crook that breaks and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters--Graham stood listening keenly. He,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, looked. He saw dimly a wire grating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some desks and stools, and recognized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conventional fittings of a bank office. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not long to wait; for now the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were advancing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silently they all three entered the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Adam closed the door. Then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole along behind the desks. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">yeggs knew their way perfectly, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">they never yet had seen the place. Dave's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reconnaissance had made all plain to them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a few seconds they had reached the fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther end of the grating. Now they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to the right and cross the floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank. The vault, they knew, was at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like wraiths the little "three-string" ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE STEELED CONSCIENCE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">567</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced toward it. But, all at once, a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from somewhere off to the left--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of stealthy footsteps. Graham's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart leaped. He knew, instinctively, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a watchman had perceived them and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping down a corridor, the dark opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which he could just make out, as greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness in the gloom, at the far corner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt a tug at his sleeve and ran forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the other two, into the shelter of a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">alcove where stood two tables for the use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrons of the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unbreathing, the trio waited. On came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watchman. They saw a yellow light</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling along the floor; then, quite sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, a dark figure appeared. " Uhhh! "</seg><seg type="columnLine">they heard a grunt of surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up went the figure's arm, in the unmis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takable gesture of a man about to shoot. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">p'stol-hammer clicked. But Graham, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side, leaped like a panther. He drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fist at the man. It landed--hard. Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham heard the pistol clatter on the marble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The watchman's cry died, choked in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">inception by Piano's grip on his throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam, daring not to take a hand because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nitro, stood back. " Tie him, dat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all!" he whispered sibilantly. The three</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting men went down in a heap, Piano's</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutch never weakening. The watcher's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern flickered out, ill-smelling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " In my right-hand pocket--the cord! "</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded Piano. Graham fumbled it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, trembling with eagerness, a strange and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild passion filling him. With a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">dexterity he never knew lay in him, he triced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man. Piano gagged him with his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief. Inside of a minute and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half the watchman, safely disposed of, lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the tables in the alcove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They heard his labored breathing, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creaking of his futile, dumb struggles as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stood there listening to determine</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether any further interference might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But all was still.

"If we want-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to ^sh that in with a sledge, I guess it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn t take long, but the oil's quicker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">You watch, now," he added to Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You're going to learn a thing or two, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve me! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His inspection of the vault finished, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">glinted the light over the door, noting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorn the apparent solidity of the smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and handsomely-painted plates, of the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinges, and the polished knob and dial.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nickel and scroll-work never could fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess she won't bother us much!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">commented he. " Look at that crack!

"Now for de</seg><seg type="columnLine">grease.

The formidable liquid seeped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the crack, filling the air-tight, space be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the door and the jamb. Piano, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meanwhile, had taken from the satchel</seg><seg type="columnLine">a roll of insulated wire and a dry-battery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">together with a detonating-cap. He set the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap in the soap-cup, made the proper at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tachment and uncoiled die wire, while Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham held the light for him. Adam poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few more drops of the nitro-glycerine over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Now," said he, " ve blanket her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">den set her off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly they piled some chairs against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vault and covered everything with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy rug.

The chairs tipped over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid and fell to the floor. The echoes ceased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All grew still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piano snatched the lamp from Graham's</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling hand. In a second he was throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing light over the door, while Graham stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly watching and Adam shoved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs away. Graham heard Piano laugh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw that both hinges had been broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">off in a jagged line, and that an irregular</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack extended from the dial half-way up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Gift' her anodder. and she'll cave," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam, calm and judicious as though it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely a question of an obstinate ice-box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifteen minutes later the outer door had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been blown again and the shattered pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid aside, the inner one opened merely by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano's delicate manipulation--the lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a simple combination, of no real diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty---and the "damper" or cash-drawer</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripped open with another and smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Graham's astonished eyes ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared thick stacks of bills, neatly bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">with paper strips, together with some dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">coin-sacks of stout canvas. His hand shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that he could hardly keep the pencil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light on the treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," remarked Piano, "this looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right, don't it?

The newspapers, that summer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chronicled a long series of unusually daring</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushes, now here, now there, within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE STEELED CONSCIENCE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">569</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">radius of a hundred miles from New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">City. Sometimes two breaks would occur</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a single night, miles apart, yet showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidences of having been put through by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same mysterious gang, not one member</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which could be rounded up by the au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many an old-time suspect, the miserable</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Prussian " or tramp, had to be ditched or</seg><seg type="columnLine">put in " stir " as a substitute for the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">men or as a sop to public opinion. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning, that never strikes twice in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same place, the mob could never be fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalled. Its " finders " or " plant-hunters,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police knew, must be marvelously clever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham served in that capacity on sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral occasions. His keen powers of ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servation and his high natural intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him invaluable. Rewards offered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, county, or State officers brought no</seg><seg type="columnLine">results. Stone and steel proved no effective</seg><seg type="columnLine">barriers. No clues were ever left save an</seg><seg type="columnLine">auto-track which became obliterated in' a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few miles.

Though he shared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others in the brassing-up, he carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved all this money and kept a strict pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vate account of it, with the amount, place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where taken, and date, set down in business-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like form. What money he spent was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own, drawn through an intermediary</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his bank where he still had between</seg><seg type="columnLine">three arid four hundred dollars. Not one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mob suspected that he ever intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to the upper world again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piano, of course, knew what had led him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to join the gang; but Piano kept a close</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. Graham, when one day repaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fifty that had been loaned him in Bos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, asked Piano point-blank his motive in</seg><seg type="columnLine">having dius taken him into so close a circle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano with an apparent equal frankness</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered that the underworld needed just</seg><seg type="columnLine">such talents of eye, ear and brain as Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham possessed. Graham saw clearly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his teacher entertained hopes of bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him permanently into the work. That idea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he finally decided, was all that lay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano's mind; though once in a while some</seg><seg type="columnLine">little uneasy suspicion of possibly another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(To be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">motive, not quite so clear, would force itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his unwilling attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Occasionally Piano would bring up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of the Security Storage Warehouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what lay therein, as though to stimu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late Graham's interest.
