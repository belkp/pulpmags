It may be there are directions in which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have some capacity, but the conduct of business</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations is not among</seg><seg type="columnLine">these.

It seemed to me, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, that there was nothing for it but to write a</seg><seg type="columnLine">play, unless I wanted to drudge for my living as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk. I have a certain imagination, and luxurious</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastes, and I meant to make a vigorous fight for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it before that fate overtook me. In addition to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief in my powers as a business man, I had always</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I3ESIDES being one of his masterpieces, this amazing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">story, by H. G. Wells, is undoubtedly one of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">greatest moon talcs of adventure ever written. For ages</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speculation has been rife as to what sort of creatures the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moon could harbor. IVe of today know that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moon has no atmosphere, at least not on the surface. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know the moon to be a dead world, having long cooled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down, its volcanic activities stopped long before the first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">living creature crazvled upon this earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The moon, therefore, must be a dead world--so our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scientists now argue. That means that its interior prob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ably contains enormous grottoes and caves, such as are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not found in our world. It is possible, therefore, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">remnants of a long-vanished atmosphere of the moon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will be found in the interior of that planet, making</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it highly probable for some sort of organism to carry on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an existence there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  What grotesque form such organisms have taken on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">during the ages it is impossible to definitely affirm. One</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man's guess is as good as another's. But somehow H. G.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wells, in this story, probably comes as close to the truth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as any one can. And the story is written so convincingly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that instead of gaining the impression that yau arc read-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing fiction, you sense, rather, that you are reading a true</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">exploration tale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We know that you will follow the developments in this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">story with breathless interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in those days had an idea that I was equal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing a very good play. It is not, I believe, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very uncommon persuasion. I knew there is noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a man can do outside legitimate business trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actions that has such opulent possibilities, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">very probably that biased my opinion. I had, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, got into the habit of regarding this unwritten</seg><seg type="columnLine">drama as a convenient little reserve put by for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainy day. That rainy day had come, and I set to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I soon discovered that writing a play was a longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">business than I had supposed; at first I had reckon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed ten days for it, and it was to have a 'pied-b-terre</seg><seg type="columnLine">while it was in hand, that I came to Lympne. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckoned myself lucky in getting that little bunga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. I got it on a three years' agreement. I put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a few sticks of furniture, and while the play</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in hand I did my own cooking. My cooking</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have shocked Mrs. Bond. And yet, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, it had flavour. I had a coffee-pot, a sauce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pan for eggs, and one for potatoes, and a frying</seg><seg type="columnLine">pan for sausages and bacon--such was the simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus of my comfort. One cannot always be</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnificent, but simplicity is always a possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternative. For the rest I laid in an eighteen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallon cask of beer on credit, and a trustful baker</seg><seg type="columnLine">came each day. It was not, perhaps, in the style</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sybaris, but I have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">HfijlHBSSfifisfiB worse times. I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little sorry for the baker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was a very decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">man indeed, but even for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him I hoped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Certainly if any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants solitude, the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Lympne. It is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clay part of Kent, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow stood on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of an old sea cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared across the flats</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Romney Marsh at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea. In very wet weather</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place is almost inac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessible, and I have heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that at times the postman</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to traverse the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">succulent portions of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">route with boards upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. I never saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing so, but I can quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine it. Outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors of the few cottages</seg><seg type="columnLine">and houses that make up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the present village big</seg><seg type="columnLine">birch besoms are stuck, to wipe off the worst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clay, which will give some idea of the texture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the district. I doubt if the place would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">there at all, if it were not a fading memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things gone for ever. It was the big port of Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land in Roman times, Portus Lemanus, and now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea is four miles away. All down the steep hill are</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders and masses of Roman brickwork, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it old Watling Street, still paved in places, starts</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an arrow to the north. I used to stand on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill and think of it all, the galleys and legions, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captives and officials, the women and traders, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">776</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AM AZIN OTSTORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">speculators like myself, all the swarm and tumult</seg><seg type="columnLine">that came clanking in and out of the harbour. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now just a few lumps of rubble on a grassy slope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a sheep or two--and I! And where the port</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been were the levels of the marsh, sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">round in a broad curve to distant Dungeness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dotted here and there with tree clumps and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">church towers of old mediajval towns that are fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing Leman us now towards extinction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That outlook on the marsh was, indeed, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the finest views I have ever seen. I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dungeness was fifteen miles away; it lay like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">raft on the sea, and farther westward were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills by Hastings under the setting sun. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times they hung close and clear, sometimes they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were faded and low, and often the drift of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather took them clean out of sight. And all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearer parts of the marsh were laced and lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">by ditches and canals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The window at which I worked looked over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skyline of this crest, and it was from this window</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I first set eyes on Cavor. It was just as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was struggling with my scenario, holding down</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind to the sheer hard work of it, and natural-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly enough he arrested my attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun had set, the sky was a vivid tranquillity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green and yellow, and against that he came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">black--the oddest little figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a short, round-bodied, thin-legged little</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, with a jerky quality in his motions; he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen fit to clothe his extraordinary mind in a &lt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">cricket cap, and overcoat, and cycling knickerbock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers and stockings. Why he did so I do not know, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he never cycled and he never played cricket. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fortuitous concurrence of garments, aris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing I know not how. He gesticulated with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and arms, and jerked his head about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzed. He buzzed like something electric. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">never heard such buzzing. And ever and again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared his throat with a most extraordinary noise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There had been rain, and that spasmodic walk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his was enhanced by the extreme slipperiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the footpath. Exactly as he came against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun he stopped, pulled out a watch, hesitated. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sort of convulsive gesture he turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreated with every manifestation of haste, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer gesticulating, but going with ample strides</seg><seg type="columnLine">that showed the relatively large size of his feet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were, I remember, grotesquely exaggerated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">size by adhesive clay--to the best possible advan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This occurred on the first day of my sojourn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when my play-writing energy was at its height</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I regarded the incident simply as an annoying</seg><seg type="columnLine">distraction--the waste of five minutes. I return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to my scenario. But when next evening the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparition was repeated with remarkable preci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, and again the next evening, and indeed every</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening when rain was not falling, concentration</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the scenario became a considerable effort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Confound the man," said I, "one would think he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was learning to be a marionette!" and for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenings I cursed him pretty heartily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then my annoyance gave way to amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">and curiosity. Why on earth should a man do</seg><seg type="columnLine">this thing? On the fourteenth evening I could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  stand it no longer, and so soon as he appeared I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  opened the French window, crossed the verandah,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  and directed myself to the point where he invari-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ably stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He had his watch out as I came up to him. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  had a chubby, rubicund face with reddish brown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  eyes--previously I had seen him only against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  light. "One moment, sir," said I as he turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He stared. "One moment," he said, "certainly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Or if you wish to speak to me for longer, and it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  is not asking too much--your moment is up--would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  it trouble you to accompany me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not in the least," said I, placing myself beside</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "My habits are regular. My time for intercourse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  --limited."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This, I presume, is your time for exercise?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is.

"Do I do that?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Every blessed evening."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I had no idea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He stopped dead. He regarded me gravely. "Can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  it be," he said, "that I have formed a Habit?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, it looks like it. Doesn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He pulled down his lower lip between finger and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  thumb. He regarded a puddle at his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "My mind is much occupied," he said, "And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  you want to know why! Well, sir, I can assure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  you that not only do I not know why I do these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  things, but I did not even know I did them. Come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  to think, it is just as you say; I never have been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  beyond that field . . . And these things annoy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For some reason I was beginning to relent to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  wards him.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression became so eloquent of distress, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">relented still more. After all, there is a touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">aggression in demanding of a man you don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">why he hums on a public footpath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," he said weakly, "it's a habit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I recognise that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must stop it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But not if it puts you out. After all, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no business--it's something of a liberty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not at all, sir," he said, "not at all. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly indebted to you. I should guard myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">against these things. In future I will. Could I</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble you--once again? That noise?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Something like this," I said. "Zuzzoo, zuzzoo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But really, you know-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am greatly obliged to you.

I raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hat and wished him a good evening. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">responded convulsively, and so we went our ways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the stile I looked back at his receding figure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His bearing had changed remarkably, he seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp, shrunken. The contrast with his former</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesticulating, zuzzooing self took me in some ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surd way as pathetic. I watched him out of sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then wishing very heartily I had kept to my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">business, I returned to my bungalow and my play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next evening I saw nothing of him, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next. But he was very much in my mind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had occurred to me that as a sentimental comic</seg><seg type="columnLine">character he might serve a useful purpose in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">development of my plot. The third day he called</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time I was puzzled to think what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him. He made indifferent conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the most formal way, then abruptly he came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">business. He wanted to buy me out of my bunga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," he said, "I don't blame you in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, but you've destroyed a habit, and it dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">organises my day. I've walked past here for years</seg><seg type="columnLine">--years. No doubt I've hummed. . . . You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">made all that impossible!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I suggested he might try some other direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No. There is no other direction. This is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one. I've inquired. And now--every after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon at four--I come to a dead wall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, my dear sir, if the thing is so important</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's vital. You see, I'm--I'm an investigator</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I am engaged in a scientific research. I live--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he paused and seemed to think. "Just over there,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, and pointed suddenly dangerously near</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eye. "The house with white chimneys you see</seg><seg type="columnLine">just over the trees. And my circumstances are ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal--abnormal. I am on the point of complet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one of the most important demonstrations--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can assure you one of the most important demon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">strations that have ever been made. It requires</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant thought, constant mental ease and activ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. And the afternoon was my brightest time!--</seg><seg type="columnLine">effervescing with new ideas--new points of view."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why not come by still?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would be all different I should be self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious. I should think of you at your play--</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching me irritated--instead of thinking of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. No! I must have the bungalow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I meditated. Naturally, I wanted to think the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter over thoroughly before anything decisive</seg><seg type="columnLine">was said. I was generally ready enough for busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness in those days, and selling always attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">me; but in the first place it was not my bungalow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even if I sold it to him at a good price I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might get inconvenienced in the delivery of goods</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the current owner got wind of the transaction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the second I was, well--undischarged. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clearly a business that required delicate hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling. Moreover, the possibility of his being in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit of some valuable invention also interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. It occurred to me that I would like to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of this research, not with any dishonest in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention, but simply with an idea that to know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was would be a relief from play-writing. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw out feelers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was quite willing to supply information.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, once he was fairly under way the conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation became a monologue. He talked like a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">long pent up, who has had it over with himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and again. He talked for nearly an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I must confess I found it a pretty stiff bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening. But through it all there was the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone of satisfaction one feels when one is neglect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing work one has set oneself. During that first</seg><seg type="columnLine">interview I gathered very little of the drift of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk. Half his words were technicalities entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange to me, and he illustrated one or two points</seg><seg type="columnLine">with what he was pleased to call elementary mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matics, computing on an envelope with a copying-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ink pencil, in a manner that made it hard even to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to understand. "Yes," I said, "yea. Go on!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevertheless I made out enough to convince me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was no mere crank playing at discoveries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In spite of his crank-like appearance there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">force about him that made that impossible. Wfcat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever it was, it was a thing with mechanical possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bilities. He told me of a work-shed he had, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of three assistants--originally jobbing carpenters</seg><seg type="columnLine">--whom he had trained. Now, from the work-shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the patent office is clearly only one step. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">invited me to see those things. I accepted readily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took care, by a remark or so, to underline that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The proposed transfer of the bungalow remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">very conveniently in suspense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last he rose to depart, with an apology for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length of his call. Talking over his work was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, a pleasure enjoyed only too rarely. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not often he found such an intelligent listener</seg><seg type="columnLine">as myself, he mingled very little with professional</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So much pettiness," he explained; "so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">intrigue! And really, when one has an idea--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">novel, fertilising idea-- I don't want to be un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charitable, but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am a man who believes in impulses. I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">778</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">what was perhaps a rash proposition. But you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must remember, that I had been alone, play-writing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Lympne, for fourteen days, and my compunction</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his ruined walk still hung about me. "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">not," said I, "make this your new habit? In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of the one I spoilt? At least, until we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle about the bungalow. What you want is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn over your work in your mind. That you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">always done during your afternoon walk. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunately that's over--you can't get things back</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they were. But why not come and talk about</seg><seg type="columnLine">your work to me; use me as a sort of wall against</seg><seg type="columnLine">which you may throw your thoughts and catch them</seg><seg type="columnLine">again? It's certain I don't know enough to steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">your ideas myself--and I know no scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">men-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stopped. He was considering. Evidently the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing attracted him. "But I'm afraid I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore you," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You think I'm too dull?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no; but technicalities-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anyhow, you've interested me immensely this</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course it would be a great help to me. Noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing clears up one's ideas so much as explaining them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hitherto--&gt;--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear sir, say no more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But really can you spare the time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no rest like change of occupation," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, with profound conviction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The affair was over. On my verandah steps he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. "I am already greatly indebted to you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I made an interrogative noise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have completely cured me of that ridicu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous habit of humming," he explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think I said I was glad to be of any service to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and he turned away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately the train of thought that our con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation had suggested must have resumed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">sway. His arms began to wave in their former</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion. The faint echo of "zuzzoo" came back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me on the breeze. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, after all, that was not my affair. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came the next day, and again the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">day after that, and delivered two lectures on physics</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our mutual satisfaction. He talked with an air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being extremely lucid about the "ether," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"tubes of force," and "gravitational potential,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and things like that, and I sat in my other folding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair and said, "Yes," "Go on," "I follow you," to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep him going. It was tremendously difficult stuff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I do not think he ever suspected how much I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not understand him. There were moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I doubted whether I was well employed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any rate I was resting from that confounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">play. Now and then things gleamed on me clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a space, only to vanish just when I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had hold of them. Sometimes my attention failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether, and I would give it up and sit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stare at him, wondering whether, after all, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be better to use him as a central figure in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good farce and let all this other stuff slide. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, perhaps, I would catch on again for a bit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the earliest opportunity I went to see his</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. It was large and carelessly furnished; there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were no servants other than his three assistants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his dietary and private life were characterised</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a philosophical simplicity. He was a water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinker, a vegetarian, and all those logical dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciplinary things. But the sight of his equipment</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled many doubts. It looked like business from</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellar to attic--an amazing little place to find in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">out-of-the-way village. The ground-floor rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained benches and apparatus, the bakehouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scullery boiler had developed into respectable</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnaces, dynamos occupied the cellar, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a gasometer in the garden. He showed it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with all the confiding zest of a man who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been living too much alone. His seclusion was over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowing now in an excess of confidence, and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the good luck to be the recipient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three assistants were creditable specimens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the class of "handy-men" from which they came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conscientious, if unintelligent, strong, civil, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing. One, Spargus, who did the cooking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the metal work, had been a sailor; a second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gibbs, was a joiner; and the third was an ex-job-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing gardener, and now general assistant. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the merest labourers. All the intelligent work</seg><seg type="columnLine">was done by Cavor. Theirs was the darkest ignor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance compared even with my muddled impression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, as to the nature of these inquiries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, unhappily, comes a grave difficulty. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">no scientific expert, and if I were to attempt to set</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth in the highly scientific language of Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavor the aim to which his experiments tended, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am afraid I should confuse not only the reader but</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, and almost certainly I should make some</seg><seg type="columnLine">blunder that would bring upon me the mockery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">every up-to-date student of mathematical physics</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the country. The best thing I can do therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, I think, to give my impressions in my own inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">act language, without any attempt to wear a gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of knowledge to which I have no claim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The object of Mr. Cavor's search was a substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that should be "opaque"--he used some other word</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have forgotten, but "opaque" conveys the idea--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to "all forms of radiant energy." "Radiant</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy," he made me understand, was anything like</seg><seg type="columnLine">light or heat, or those Rontgen Rays there was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much talk about a year or so ago, or the electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves of Marconi, or gravitation. All these things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, radiate out from centres, and act on bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a distance, whence comes the term "radiant</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy." Now almost all substances are opaque</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some form or other of radiant energy. Glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for example, is transparent to light, but much less</seg><seg type="columnLine">so to heat, so that it is useful as a fire-screen; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">alum is transparent to light, but blocks heat almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely. A solution of iodine in carbon bisul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phide, on the other hand, completely blocks light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but is quite transparent to heat. It will hide a fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">from you, but permit all its warmth to reach you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Metals are not only opaque to light and heat, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">also to radiant electrical energy, which passes</seg><seg type="columnLine">through both iodine solution and glass almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they were not interposed. And so on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now all known substances are "transparent" to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitation. You can use screens of various sorts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cut off the light or heat, or electrical influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun, or the warmth of the earth from any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77 9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing; you can screen things by sheets of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Marconi's rays, but nothing will cut off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational attraction of the sun or the gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional attraction of the earth. Yet why there</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be nothing it is hard to say. Cavor did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see why such a substance should not exist, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly I could not tell him. I had never thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such a possibility before. He showed me by</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations on paper, which Lord Kelvin, no doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Professor Lodge, or Professor Karl Pearson, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of those great scientific people might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood, but which simply reduced me to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless muddle, that not only was such a sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance possible, but that it must satisfy certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions. It was an amazing piece of reasoning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Much as it amazed and exercised me at the time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be impossible to reproduce it here. "Yes,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said to it all, "yes; go on!" Suffice it for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">story that he believed he might be able to manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">facture this possible substance opaque to gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion out of a complicated alloy of metals and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing new--a new element, I fancy--called, I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve, helium, which was sent to him from London</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sealed stone jars. Doubt has been thrown upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">this detail, but I am almost certain it was helium</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had sent him in sealed stone jars. It was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly something very gaseous and thin. If only</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had taken notes. » . ,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But then, how was I to foresee the necessity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking notes?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Any one with the merest germ of an imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">will understand the extraordinary possibilities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a substance, and will sympathise a little with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the emotion I felt as this understanding emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the haze of abstruse phrases in which Cavor</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed himself. Comic relief in a play indeed!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was some time before I would believe that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had interpreted him aright, and I was very careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to ask questions that would have enabled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gauge the profundity of misunderstanding into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he dropped his daily exposition. But no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading the story of it here will sympathise fully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because from my barren narrative it will be im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to gather the strength of my conviction</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this astonishing substance was positively going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be made.	/■</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I do not recall that I gave my play an hour's</seg><seg type="columnLine">consecutive work at any time after my visit to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. My imagination had other things to do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There seemed no limit to the possibilities of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff; whichever way I tried I came on miracles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and revolutions. For example, if one wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift a weight, however enormous, one had only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a sheet of this substance beneath it, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">might lift it with a straw. My first natural impulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to apply this principle to guns and ironclads,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all the material and methods of war, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that to shipping, locomotion, building, every con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceivable form of human industry. The chance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought me into the very birth-chamber of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this new time--it was an epoch, no less--was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those chances that come once in a thousand years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thing unrolled, it expanded and expanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Among other things I saw in it my redemption as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">business man. I saw a parent company, and daugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter companies, applications to right of us, applica-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tions to left, rings and trusts, privileges, and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessions spreading and spreading, until one vast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupendous Cavorite company ran and ruled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I was in it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took my line straight away. I knew I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">staking everything, but I jumped there and then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're on absolutely the biggest thing that has</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever been invented," I said, and put the accent</seg><seg type="columnLine">on "we." "If you want to keep me out of this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll have to do it with a gun. I'm coming down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be your fourth labourer to-morrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed surprised at my enthusiasm, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit suspicious or hostile. Bather, he was self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">depreciatory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at me doubtfully. "But do you really</seg><seg type="columnLine">think--?" he said. "And your play I How about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that play?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's vanished!" I cried. "My dear sir, don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see what you've got? Don't you see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're going to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was merely a rhetorical turn, but positively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't. At first I could not believe it. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not had the beginning of the inkling of an idea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This astonishing little man had been working on</seg><seg type="columnLine">purely theoretical grounds the whole time! When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said it was "the most important" research the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world had ever seen, he simply meant it squared</seg><seg type="columnLine">up so many theories, settled so much that was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt; he had troubled no more about the appli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation of the stuff he was going to turn out than if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been a machine that makes guns. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a possible substance, and he was going to make it!</seg><seg type="columnLine">V'la tout, as the Frenchman says.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond that, he was childish! If he made it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would go down to posterity as -Cavorite or Cavor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine, and he would be made an F.R.S., and his por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trait given away as a scientific worthy with Nature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and things like that. And that was all he saw!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would have dropped this -bombshell into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world as though he had discovered a new species of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnat, if it had not happened that I had come along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there it would have lain and fizzled, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two other little things these scientific people</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lit and dropped about us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I realised this, it was I did the talking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Cavor who said, "Go on!" I jumped up. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">paced the room, gesticulating like a boy of twenty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to make him understand his duties and</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsibilities in the matter--our duties and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsibilities in the matter. I assured him we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might make wealth enough to work any sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">social revolution we fancied, we might own and</seg><seg type="columnLine">order the whole world. I told him of companies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">patents, and the case for secret processes. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things seemed to take him much as his mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matics had taken me. A look of perplexity came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his ruddy little face. He stammered something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about indifference to wealth, but I brushed all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that aside. He had got to be rich, and it was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">good his stammering. I gave him to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sort of man I was, and that I had had very</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable business experience. I did not tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him I was an undischarged bankrupt at the time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because that was temporary, but I think I reconciled</seg><seg type="columnLine">my evident poverty with my financial claims. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">780</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> quite insensibly, in the way such projects grow,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the understanding of a Cavorite monopoly grew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> up between us. He was to make the stuff, and I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was to make the boom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I stuck like a leech to the "we"--"you" and "I",</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> didn't exist for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   His idea was that the profits I spoke of might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> go to endow research, but that, of course, was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> matter we had to settle later. "That's all right,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shouted, "that's all right." The great point,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as I insisted, was to get the thing done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Here is a substance," I cried, "no home, no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">factory, no fortress, no ship can dare to be without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--more universally applicable even than a patent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">medicine.

On the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">14th of October, 1899, this incredible sub-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stance was made!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Oddly enough, it was made at last by accident,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> when Mr. Cavor least expected it. He had fused</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> together a number of metals and certain other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> things--I wish I knew the particulars now!--and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he intended to leave the mixture a week and then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> allow it to cool slowly. Unless he had miscalculated,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the last stage in the combination would occur when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the stuff sank to a temperature of 60° Fahr. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it chanced that, unknown to Cavor, dissension had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> arisen about the furnace tending. Gibbs, who had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> previously seen to this, had suddenly attempted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to shift it to the man who had been a gardener, on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the score that coal was soil, being dug, and therefore</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> v could not possibly fall within the province of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> joiner; the man who had been a jobbing gardener</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> alleged, however, that coal was a metallic or ore-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> like substance, let alone that he was cook. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spargus insisted on Gibbs doing the coaling, seeing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that he was a joiner and that coal is notoriously</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fossil wood. Consequently Gibbs ceased to replen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ish the furnace, and no one else did so, and Cavor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was too much immersed in certain interesting prob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lems concerning a Cavorite flying machine (neglect-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ing the resistance of the air and one or two other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> points) to perceive that anything was wrong. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> thp	bfr+h n? his invention took place</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">just as he was coming across the field to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow for our afternoon talk and tea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remember the occasion with extreme vividness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The water was boiling, and everything was pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared, and the sound of his "zuezoo" had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">me out upon the verandah. His active little figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">was black against the autumnal sunset, and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right the chimneys of his house just rose above</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gloriously tinted group of trees. Remoter rose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wealden Hills, faint and blue, while to the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hazy marsh spread out spacious and serene. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chimneys jerked heavenward, smashing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a string of bricks as they rose, and the roof and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">miscellany of furniture followed. Then overtaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">them came a huge white flame. The trees about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building swayed and whirled and tore themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pieces, that sprang towards the flare. My ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">were smitten with a clap of thunder that left me</seg><seg type="columnLine">deaf on one side for life, and all about me win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows smashed, unheeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took three steps from the verandah towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavor's house and even as I did so came the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly my coat tails were over my head, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was progressing in great leaps and bounds, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite against my will, towards him. In the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the discoverer was seized, whirled about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flew through the screaming air. I saw one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chimney pots hit the ground within six yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me, leap a score of feet, and so hurry in great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strides towards the focus of the disturbance. Cavor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicking and flapping, came down again, rolled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over on the ground for a space, struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and was lifted and borne forward at an enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous velocity, vanishing at last among the labour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, lashing trees that writhed about his house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A mass of smoke and ashes, and a square of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish shining substance rushed up towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zenith. A large fragment of fencing came sailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">past me, dropped edgeways, hit the ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell flat, and then the worst was over. The aerial</seg><seg type="columnLine">commotion fell swiftly until it was a mere strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">gale, and I became once more aware that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath and feet. By leaning back against the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">I managed to stop, and could collect such wits as</seg><seg type="columnLine">still remained to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that instant the whole face of the world had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. The tranquil sunset had vanished, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky was dark with scurrying clouds, everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flattened and swaying with the gale. I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to see if my bungalow was still in a general</seg><seg type="columnLine">way standing, then staggered forward towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees amongst which Cavor had vanished, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through whose tall and leaf-denuded branches shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flames of his burning house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I entered the copse, dashing from one tree to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another and clinging to them, and for a space I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought him in vain. Then amidst a heap of smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches and fencing that had banked itself against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a portion of his garden wall I perceived something</seg><seg type="columnLine">stir. 1 made a run for this, but before I reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a brown object separated itself, rose on two</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddy legs, and protruded two drooping, bleeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Some tattered ends of garment fluttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from its middle portion and streamed before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">781</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment I did not recognise this earthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">lump, and then I saw that it was Cavor, caked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mud in whioh he had rolled. He leant forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wind, rubbing the dirt from his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He extended a muddy lump of hand, and staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pace towards me. His face worked with emotion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">little lumps of mud kept falling from it. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as damaged and pitiful as any living creature I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ever seen, and his remark therefore amazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me exceedingly. "Gratulate me," he gasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">"gratulate me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Congratulate you!" said I. "Good heavens!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've done it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have. What on earth caused that explo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A gust of wind blew his words away. I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood him to say that it wasn't an explosion at all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wind hurled me into collision with him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stood clinging to one another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Try and get back to my bungalow," I bawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his ear. He did not hear me, and shouted some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about "three martyrs--science," and also</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about "not much good." At the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he laboured under the impression that his three</seg><seg type="columnLine">attendants had perished in the whirlwind. Happily</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was incorrect. Directly he had left for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow they had gone off to the public-house in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lympne to discuss the question of the furnaces</seg><seg type="columnLine">over some trivial refreshment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I repeated my suggestion of getting back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my bungalow, and this time he understood. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung arm-in-arm and started, and managed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last to reach the shelter of as much roof as was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. For a space we sat in arm-chairs and panted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the windows were broken, and the lighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">articles of furniture were in great disorder, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">irrevocable damage was done. Happily the kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">door had stood the pressure upon it, so that all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">crockery and cooking materials had survived. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil stove was still burning, and I put on the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">to boil again for tea. And that prepared, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn on Cavor for his explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quite correct," he insisted; "quite correct. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">done it, and it's all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," I protested. "All right! Why, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't be a rick standing, or a fence or a thatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof undamaged for twenty miles round. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all right--really. I didn't, of course, foresee</seg><seg type="columnLine">this little upset. My mind was preoccupied with</seg><seg type="columnLine">another problem, and I'm apt to disregard these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">practical side issues. But it's all right-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear sir," I cried, "don't you see you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">done thousands of pounds' worth of damage?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There, I throw myself on your discretion. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a practical man, of course, but don't you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will regard it as a cyclone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the explosion-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was not an explosion.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose you know--everybody knows nowadays--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, as a usual thing, the air has weight, that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">presses on everything at the surface of the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">presses in all directions, with a pressure of fourteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a half pounds to the square inch?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know that," said L "Go on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know that too," he remarked.

Ah! you begin to see! The air all about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavorite crushed in upon the air above it with ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistible force. The air above the Cavorite was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced upward violently, the air that rushed in to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place it immediately lost weight, ceased to exert any</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure, followed suit, blew the ceiling through</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the roof off. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Tou perceive," he said, "it formed a sort ©f</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmospheric fountain, a kind of chimney in the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere.

Later on, when you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in with your practical mind, and Cavorite is</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated--floated is the word, isn't it?--and it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">realised all you anticipate for it, we may set matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">right with these persons.

It was clear there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawbacks to Mr. Cavor's society I had not fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. The absent-mindedness that had just escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">depopulating the terrestrial globe, might at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment result in some other grave inconvenience.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the other hand I was young, my affairs were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mess, and I was in just the mood for reckless</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure--with a chance of something good at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of it. I had quite settled in my mind that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to have half at least in that aspect of the affair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortunately I held my bungalow, as I have already</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained, on a three-year agreement, without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for repairs; and my furniture, such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was of it, had been hastily purchased, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpaid for, insured, and altogether devoid of as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sociations. In the end I decided to keep on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and see the business through. ^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Certainly the aspect of things had changed very</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly. I no longer doubted at all the enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities of the substance, but I began to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubts about the gun-carriage and the patent boots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We set to work at once to reconstruct his labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory and proceed with our experiments. Cavor</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked more on my level than he had ever done</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, when it came to the question of how we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should make the stuff next.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course we must make it again," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sort of glee I had not expected in him, "of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course we must make it again. We have caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Tartar, perhaps, but we have left the theoretical</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us for good and all. If we can possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid wrecking this little planet of ours, we will.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But--there must be risks! There must be. In ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">perimental work there always are. And here, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical man, you must come in. For my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">part it seems to me we might make it edgeways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, and very thin. Yet I don't know. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain dim perception of another method. I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly explain it yet. But curiously enough it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into my mind, while I was rolling over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in the mud before the wind, and very doubtful</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the whole adventure was to end, as being</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely the thing I ought to have done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even with my aid we found some little difficulty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and meanwhile we kept at work restoring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory. There was plenty to do before it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely necessary to decide upon the precise form</seg><seg type="columnLine">and method of our second attempt. Our only hitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the strike of the three labourers, who objected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my activity as a foreman. But that matter we</seg><seg type="columnLine">compromised after two days' delay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Building of the Sphere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I REMEMBER the occasion very distinctly when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavor told me of his idea of the sphere. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had intimations of it before, but at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it seemed to come to him in a rush. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were returning to the bungalow for tea, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way he fell humming. Suddenly he shouted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's it! That finishes it! A sort of roller</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Finishes what?"

Why--it must be a sphere! That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I mean!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw I was out of it, and for a time I let him</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk in his own fashion. I hadn't the ghost of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea then of his drift. But after he had taken tea</seg><seg type="columnLine">he made it clear to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's like this," he said. "Last time I ran this</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff that cuts things off from gravitation into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat tank with an overlap that held it down.

"You're not safe to get anywhere, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you do--how will you get back?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've just thought of that," said Cavor. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I meant when I said the thing is finished.

Suddenly I saw, as in a vision, the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system threaded with Cavorite liners and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres de luxe. "Rights of preemption," came</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating into my head--planetary rights of pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emption. I recalled the old Spanish monopoly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">American gold. It wasn't as though it was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">this planet or that--it was all of them. I stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavor's rubicund face, and suddenly my imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was leaping and dancing. I stood up, I walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down; my tongue was unloosened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm beginning to take it in," I said; "I'm be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to take it in." The transition from doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enthusiasm seemed to take scarcely any time at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. "But this is tremendous!" I cried. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Imperial! I haven't been dreaming of this sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once the chill of my opposition was removed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own pent-up excitement had play.

We'll start the drawings for</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouldings this very night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll start them now," I responded, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried off to the laboratory to begin upon this</seg><seg type="columnLine">work forthwith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was like a child in Wonderland all that night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">784</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The dawn found us both still at work--we kept our</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric light going heedless of the day. I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber now exactly how those drawings looked. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaded and tinted while Cavor drew--smudged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and haste-marked they were in every line, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderfully correct. We got out the orders for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steel blinds and frames we needed from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night's work, and the glass sphere was designed</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a week. We gave up our afternoon conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sations and our old routine altogether. We worked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we slept and ate when we could work no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">for hunger and fatigue. Our enthusiasm infected</seg><seg type="columnLine">even our three men, though they had no idea what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere was for. Through those days the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gibbs gave up walking, and went everywhere, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the room, at a sort of fussy run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And it grew--the sphere. December passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">January--I spent a day with a broom sweeping a</seg><seg type="columnLine">path through the snow from bungalow to labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory--February, March. By the end of March the</seg><seg type="columnLine">completion was in sight. In January had come a</seg><seg type="columnLine">team of horses, a huge packing-case; we had our</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick glass sphere now ready, and in position un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the crane we had rigged to sling it into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel shell. All the bars and blinds of the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell--it was not really a spherical shell, but poly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedral, with a roller blind to each facet--had ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived by February, and the lower half was bolted</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. The Cavorite was half made by March,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metallic paste had gone through two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stages in its manufacture, and we had plastered</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite half of it on to the steel bars and blinds. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was astonishing how closely we kept to the line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavor's first inspiration in working out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme. When the bolting together of the sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finished, he proposed to remove the rough roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the temporary laboratory in which the work was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, and build a furnace about it. So the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">atage of Cavorite making, in which the paste is</seg><seg type="columnLine">heated to a dull red glow in a stream of helium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be accomplished when it was already on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then we had to discuss and decide what</seg><seg type="columnLine">provisions we were to take--compressed foods, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated essences, steel cylinders containing re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve oxygen, an arrangement for removing car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonic acid and waste from the air and restoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen by means of sodium peroxide, water con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">densers, and so forth. I remember the little heap</seg><seg type="columnLine">they made in the corner--tins, and rolls, and boxes</seg><seg type="columnLine">--convincingly matter-of-fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a strenuous time, with little chance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking. But one day, when we were drawing near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end, an odd mood came over me. I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">bricking up the furnace all the morning, and I sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by these possessions dead beat. Everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed dull and incredible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But look here, Cavor," I said. "After all!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What's it all for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled. "The thing now is to go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The moon," I reflected. "But what do you ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect? I thought the moon was a dead world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shrugged his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you expect?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're going to see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are wp?"

"You'd Better</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">take a walk this afternoon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," I said obstinately; "I'm going to finish this</seg><seg type="columnLine">brickwork."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I did, and insured myself a night of In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">somnia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I don't think I have ever had such a night. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had some bad times before my business collapse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the very worst of these was sweet slumber com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared to this infinity of aching wakefulness. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly in the most enormous funk at the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were going to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I do not remember before that night thinking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the risks we were running. Now they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that array of spectres that once beleaguered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prague, and camped around me. The strangeness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what we were about to do, the unearthliness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, overwhelmed me. I was like a man awakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of pleasant dreams to the most horrible sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings. I lay, eyes wide open, and the sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to get more flimsy and feeble, and Cavor</seg><seg type="columnLine">more unreal and fantastic, and the whole enterprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">madder and madder every moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I got out of bed and wandered about. I sat at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window and stared at the immensity of space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Between the stars was the void, the unfathomable</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness! I tried to recall the fragmentary knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of astronomy I had gained in my irregular</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading, but it was all too vague to furnish any</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of the things we might expect. At last I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to bed and snatched some moments of sleep--</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments of nightmare rather--in which I fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell and fell for evermore into the abyss of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I astonished Cavor at breakfast. I told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly, "I'm not coming with you in the sphere."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I met all his protests with a sullen persistence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The thing's too mad," I said, "and I won't come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thing's too mad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I would not go with him to the laboratory. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fretted about my bungalow for a time, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">took hat and stick and set off alone, I knew not</seg><seg type="columnLine">whither. It chanced to be a glorious morning: a</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm wind and deep blue sky, the first green of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring abroad, and multitudes of birds singing. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunched on beef and beer in a little public-house</seg><seg type="columnLine">near Elham, and startled the landlord by remarking</seg><seg type="columnLine">apropos of the weather, "A man who leaves the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world when days of this sort are about is a fooll"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's what I says when I heerd on it!" said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landlord, and I found that for one poor soul at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">this world had proved excessive, and there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a throat-cutting. I went on with a new twist to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the afternoon I had a pleasant sleep in a sunny</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, and went my way refreshed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I came to a comfortable-looking inn near Canter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bury. It was bright with creepers, and the land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady was a clean old woman and took my eye. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found I had just enough money to pay for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodging with her. I decided to stop the night there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was a talkative body, and among many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">particulars I learnt she had never been to London.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Canterbury's as far as ever I been," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm not one of your gad-about sort."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How would you like a trip to the moon?" I cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never did hold with them ballooneys," she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">785</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently nnder the impression that thi3 was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">common excursion enough.

After I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">supped, I sat on a bench by the door of the inn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gossiped with two labourers about brick-mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and motor cars, and the cricket of last year.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in the sky a faint new crescent, blue and vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a distant Alp, sank westward over the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day I returned to Cavor.

Nerves purely! After that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked a little more carefully, and took a trudge for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour every day. And at last, save for the heating</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the furnace, our labours were at an end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inside the Sphere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on," said Cavor, as I sat across the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">f -w- of the manhole and looked down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">V-l black interior of the sphere. We two were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. It was evening, the sun had set, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stillness of the twilight was upon everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I drew my other leg inside and slid down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth glass to the bottom of the sphere, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to take the cans of food and other impedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menta from Cavor. The interior was warm, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thermometer stood at eighty, and as we should lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">little or none of this by radiation, we were dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in shoes and thin flannels. We had, however, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle of thick woolen clothing and several thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankets to guard against mischance. By Cavor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction I placed the packages, the cylinders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen, and so forth, loosely about my feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon we had everything in. He walked about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roofless shed for a time seeking anything we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlooked, and then crawled in after me. I noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What have you got there?"

Although our</seg><seg type="columnLine">case would not be impervious to sound, everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very still.

Suddenly it had come to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear and vivid that I was a fool to be inside that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere. Even now, I asked myself, is it too late to</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdraw? The world outside the sphere, I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be cold and inhospitable enough to me--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks I had been living on subsidies from Cavor--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but after all, would it be as cold as the infinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">zero, as inhospitable as empty space? If it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been for the appearance of cowardice, I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even then I should have made him let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. But I hesitated on that score, and hesitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grew fretful and angry, and the time passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a little jerk, a noise like champagne</seg><seg type="columnLine">being uncorked in another room, and a faint whist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling sound. For just one instant I had a sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous tension, a transient conviction that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet were pressing downward with a force of count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less tons. It lasted for an infinitesimal time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it stirred me to action. "Cavor!"

"It's too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late for us to quarrel now, Bedford," he said. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">little jerk was the start. Already we are flying as</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly as a bullet up into the gulf of space."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I-" I said, and then it didn't seem to matter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">what happened. For a time I was, as it were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned; I had nothing to say. It was just as if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never heard of this idea of leaving the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.' Then I perceived an unaccountable change</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my bodily sensations. It was a feeling of light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, of unreality. Coupled with that was a queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation in the head, an apoplectic effect almost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a thumping of blood-vessels at the ears. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these feelings diminished as time went on, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last I got so used to them that I experienced no</seg><seg type="columnLine">inconvenience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard a click, and a little glow lamp came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw Cavor's face, as white as I felt my own to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be.

It was like being held and lifted by something</seg><seg type="columnLine">--you know not what. The mere touch of my hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the glass moved me rapidly. I understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened, but that did not prevent my</seg><seg type="columnLine">being afraid. We were cut off from all exterior</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitation, only the attraction of objects within</seg><seg type="columnLine">our sphere had effect. Consequently everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was not fixed to the glass was falling--slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of the slightness of our masses--towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the centre of gravity of our little world, which seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to be somewhere about the middle of the sphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but rather nearer to myself than Cavor, on account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my greater weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must turn round," said Cavor, "and float</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to back, with the things between us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the strangest sensation conceivable, float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thus loosely in space, at first indeed horribly</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, and when the horror passed, not disagree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able at all, exceedingly restful; indeed, the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to it in earthly experience that I know is</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying on a very thick, soft feather bed. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality of utter detachment and independence! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not reckoned on things like this. I had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected a violent jerk at starting, a giddy sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. Instead I felt--as if I were disembodied.

Now the pull of gravitation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the moon, and for all I knew to the contrary</seg><seg type="columnLine">our earth was overhead. And, of course, when all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cavorite blinds were closed, "down" was to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the centre of our sphere, and "up" towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">its outer wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was curiously unlike earthly experience, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have the light coming up to one.

And as I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared at the moon between my feet, that per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception of the impossible that had been with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">off and on ever since our start, returned again with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenfold conviction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cavor," I said, "this takes me queerly.

I take it the reader has seen pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures or photographs of the moon, so that I need</seg><seg type="columnLine">not describe the broader features of that landscape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those spacious ring-like ranges vaster than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrial mountains, their summits shining in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, their shadows harsh and deep, the gray dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered plains, the ridges, hills, and craterlets, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing at last from a blazing illumination into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">common mystery of black. Athwart this world we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were flying scarcely a hundred miles above its crest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pinnacles. And now we could see, what no eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth will ever see, that under the blaze of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day the harsh outlines of the rocks and ravines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plains and crater floor grew gray and indistinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a thickening haze, that the white of their lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">surfaces broke into lumps and patches, and broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and shrank and vanished, and that here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there strange tints of brown and olive grew and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But little time we had for watching then. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">now we had come to the real danger of our journey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had to drop ever closer to the moon as we spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it, to slacken our pace and watch our chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until at last we could dare to drop upon its surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For Cavor that was a time of intense exertion;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me it was an anxious inactivity. I seemed per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petually to be getting out of his way. He leapt</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the sphere from point to point with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">agility that would have been impossible on earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was perpetually opening and closing the Cavor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ite windows, making calculations, consulting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chronometer by means of the glow lamp during those</seg><seg type="columnLine">last eventful hours. For a long time we had all our</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows closed and hung silently in darkness hurl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he was feeling for the shutter studs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly four windows were open. I staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and covered my eyes, drenched and scorched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinded by the unaccustomed splendour of the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath my feet. Then again the shutters snapped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving my brain spinning in a darkness that pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sed against the eyes. And after that I floated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another vast, black silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Cavor switched on the electric light, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me he proposed to bind all our luggage together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the blankets about it, against the concussion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our descent. We did this with our windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, because in that way our goods arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves naturally at the centre of the sphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That too was a strange business; we two men float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing loose in that spherical space, and packing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulling ropes. Imagine it if you can! No up nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, and every effort resulting in unexpected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">movements. Now I would be pressed against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass with the full force of Cavor's thrust, now 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be kicking helplessly in a void. Now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">star of the electric light would be overhead, now un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der foot Now Cavor's feet would float up before</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes, and now we would be crossways to each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. But at last our goods were safely bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">together in a big soft bale, all except two blankets</seg><seg type="columnLine">with head holes that we were to wrap about our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then for a flash Cavor opened a window moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and we saw that we were dropping towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge central crater with a number of minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">craters grouped in a sort of cross about it. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then again Cavor flung our little sphere open to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorching, blinding sun. I think he was using the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's attraction as a brake. "Cover yourself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blanket," he cried, thrusting himself from me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment I did not understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I hauled the blanket from beneath my feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and got it about me and over my head and eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruptly he closed the shutters again, snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">one open again and closed it, then suddenly began</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping them all open, each safely into its steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">roller. There came a jar, and then we were roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over and over, bumping against the glass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the big bale of our luggage, and clutching</seg><seg type="columnLine">at each other, and outside some white substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashed as if we were rolling down a slope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over, clutch, bump, clutch, bump, over. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Came a thud, and I was half buried under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bale of our possessions, and for a space everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still. Then I could hear Cavor puffing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunting, and the snapping of a shutter in its sash.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I made an effort, thrust back our blanket-wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">luggage, and emerged from beneath it Our open</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows were just visible as a deeper black set with</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were still alive, and we were lying in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness of the shadow of the wall of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater into which we had fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We sat getting our breath again, and feeling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruises on our limbs. I don't think either of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had a very clear expectation of such rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">handling as we had received. I struggled painfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my feet. "And now," said I, "to look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landscape of the moon! But-! It's tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dously dark, Cavor!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The glass was dewy, and as I spoke I wiped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with my blanket. "We're half an hour or so</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the day," he said. "We must wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was impossible to distinguish anything. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been in a sphere of steel for all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could see. My rubbing with the blanket simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">smeared the glass, and as fast as I wiped it, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">became opaque again with freshly condensed mois-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture mixed with an increasing quantity of blanket</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairs. Of course I ought not to have used the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket. In my efforts to clear the glass I slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the damp surface, and hurt my shin against</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the oxygen cylinders that protruded from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">bale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing was exasperating--it was absurd. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were just arrived upon the moon, amidst we</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew not what wonders, and all we could see was</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">789</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the gray and streaming wall of the bubble in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound it!" I said, "but at this rate we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have stopped at home;" and I squatted on the bale</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shivered, and drew my blanket closer about</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly the moisture turned to spangles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronds of frost. "Can you reach the electric heater,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Cavor. "Yes--that black knob. Or we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">freeze."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not wait to be told twice. "And now," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, "what are we to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait," he said. "Of course. We shall have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait until our air gets warm again, and then this</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass will clear. We can't do anything till then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's night here yet; we must wait for the day to</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtake us. Meanwhile, don't you feel hungry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a space I did not answer him, but sat fretting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned reluctantly from the smeared puzzle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass and stared at his face. "Yes," I said, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am hungry. I feel somehow enormously disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed. I had expected--I don't know what I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected, but not this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I summoned my philosophy, and rearranging my</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket about me sat down on the bale again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began my first meal on the moon. I don't think I</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished it--I forget. Presently, first in patches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then running rapidly together into wider spaces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the clearing of the glass, came the drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the misty veil that hid the moon world from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wc peered out upon the landscape of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunrise on the Moon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS we saw it first it was the wildest and moat</seg><seg type="columnLine">desolate of scenes. We were in an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">amphitheatre, a vast circular plain, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of the giant crater. Its cliff-like walls closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in on every side. From the westward the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the unseen sun fell upon them, reaching to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very foot of the cliff, and showed a disordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">escarpment of drab and grayish rock, lined here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there with banks and crevices of snow. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a dozen miles away but at first no interven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing atmosphere diminished in the slightest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutely detailed brilliancy with which these things</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared at us. They stood out clear and dazzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a background of starry blackness that seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to our earthly eyes rather a gloriously spangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">velvet curtain than the spaciousness of the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eastward cliff was at first merely a starless</seg><seg type="columnLine">selvedge to the starry dome. No rosy flush, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping pallor, announced the commencing day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the Corona, the Zodiacal light, a huge cone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped, luminous haze, pointing up towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendour of the morning star, warned us of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">imminent nearness of the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whatever light was about us was reflected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the westward cliffs. It showed a huge undulating</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain, cold and gray, a gray that deepened eastward</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the absolute raven darkness of the cliff shadow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Innumerable rounded gray summits, ghostly hum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocks, billows of snowy substance, stretching crest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond crest into the remote obscurity, gave us our</seg><seg type="columnLine">first inkling of the distance of the crater walL</seg><seg type="columnLine">These hummocks looked like snow. At the time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought they were snow. But they were not--they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were mounds and masses of frozen air!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it was at first, and then, sudden, swift, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing, came the lunar day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sunlight had crept down the cliff, it touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drifted masses at its base and incontinently</seg><seg type="columnLine">came striding with seven-leagued boots towards us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The distant cliff seemed to shift and quiver, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the touch of the dawn a reek of gray vapour poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward from the crater floor, whirls and puffs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting wraiths of gray, thicker and broader and</seg><seg type="columnLine">denser, until at last the whole westward plain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming like a wet handkerchief held before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, and the westward cliffs were no more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">refracted glare beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is air," said Cavor. "It must be air--or it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not rise like this--at the mere touch of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunbeam. And at this pace. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He peered upwards. "Look!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the sky. Already. On the blackness--a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of blue. See! The stars seem larger. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">tht little ones and all those dim nebulosities we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">in empty space--they are hidden!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly, steadily, the day approached us. Gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">summit after gray summit was overtaken by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blaze, and turned to a smoking white intensity. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last there was nothing to the west of us but a bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">of surging fog, the tumultuous advance and ascent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cloudy haze. The distant cliff had receded</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther and farther, had loomed and changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the whirl, and foundered and vanished at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last in its confusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nearer came that steaming advance, nearer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer, coming as fast as the shadow of a cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the south-west wind. About us rose a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipatory haze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cavor gripped my arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look! The sunrise! The sun!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned me about and pointed to the brow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eastward cliff, looming above the haze about us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarce lighter than the darkness of the sky. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now its line was marked by strange reddish shapes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongues of vermilion flame that writhed and danced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fancied it must be spirals of vapour that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the light and made this crest of fiery tongues</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the sky, but indeed it was the solar prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inences I saw, a crown of fire about the sun that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is forever hidden from earthly eyes by our atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pheric veil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then--the sun!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steadily, inevitably came a brilliant line, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thin edge of intolerable effulgence that took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular shape, became a bow, became a blazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sceptre, and hurled a shaft of heat at us as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a spear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed verily to stab my eyes! I cried aloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned about blinded, groping for my blanket</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the bale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with that incandescence came a sound, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first sound that had reached us from without since</seg><seg type="columnLine">we left the earth, a hissing and rustling, the stormy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">790</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trailing of the aerial garment of the advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. And with the coining of the sound and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light the sphere lurched, and blinded and dazzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">we staggered helplessly against each other. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurched again, and the hissing grew louder. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut my eyes perforce, I was making clumsy efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cover my head with my blanket, and this second</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurch sent me helplessly off my feet. I fell against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bale, and opening my eyes had a momentary</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of the air just outside our glass. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">running--it was boiling--like snow into which a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-hot rod is thrust. What had been solid air</seg><seg type="columnLine">had suddenly at the touch of the sun become a</seg><seg type="columnLine">paste, a mud, a slushy liquefaction, that hissed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubbled into gas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a still more violent whirl of the sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we had clutched one another. In another</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment we were spun about again. Round we</seg><seg type="columnLine">went and over, and then I was on all fours. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunar dawn had hold of us. It meant to show us</seg><seg type="columnLine">little men what the moon could do with us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I caught a second glimpse of things without,</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffs of vapour, half-liquid slush, excavated, sliding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling, sliding. We dropped into darkness. I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with Cavor's knees in my chest. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to fly away from me, and for a moment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay with all the breath out of my body staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward. A toppling crag of the melting stiflT~iiHu</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashed over us, buried us, and now it thinned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiled off us. I saw the bubbles dancing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass above. I heard Cavor exclaiming feebly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then some huge landship in the thawing air had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught us, and spluttering expostulation, we began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to roll down a slope, rolling faster and faster, leap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing crevasses and rebounding from banks, faster and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster, westward into the white-hot boiling tumult</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lunar day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clutching at one another we spun about, pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way and that, our bale of packages leaping at</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, pounding at us. We collided, we gripped, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were torn asunder--our heads met, and the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe burst into fiery darts and stars! On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth we should have smashed one another a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, but on the moon, luckily for us, our weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only one-sixth of what it is terrestrially, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we fell very mercifully. I recall a sensation of utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickness, a feeling as if my brain were upside down</seg><seg type="columnLine">within my skull, and then-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something was at work upon my face, some thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelers worried my ears. Then I discovered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliance of the landscape around was mitigated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by blue spectacles. Cavor bent over me, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw his face upside down, his eyes also protected</seg><seg type="columnLine">by tinted goggles. His breath came irregularly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lip was bleeding from a bruise. "Better?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, wiping the blood with the back of his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything seemed swaying for a space, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was simply my giddiness. I perceived that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed some of the shutters in the outer sphere to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save me from the direct blaze of the sun. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that everything about us was very brilliant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Lord!" I gasped. "But this-!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I craned my neck to see. I perceived there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blinding glare outside, an utter change from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomy darkness of our first impressions. "Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">I been insensible long?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know--the chronometer is broken. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">little time. . . . My dear chap! I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I lay for a space taking this in. I saw his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">still bore evidences of emotion. For a while I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. I passed an inquisitive hand over my</seg><seg type="columnLine">contusions, and surveyed his face for similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">damages. The back of my right hand had suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">most, and was skinless and raw. My forehead was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruised and had bled. He handed me a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure with some of the restorative--I forget the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of it--he had brought with us. After a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt a little better. I began to stretch my limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully. Soon I could talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It wouldn't have done," I said, as though there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been no interval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! it wouldn't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought, his hands hanging over his knees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He peered through the glass and then stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. "Good Lord!" he said. "No!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has happened?" I asked after a pause.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have we jumped to the tropics?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was as I expected. This air has evaporated--</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it is air. At any rate, it has evaporated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the moon is showing.

Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there at the edge of the snowdrifts were trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ient little pools and eddies of water, the only things</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirring in that expanse of barrenness. The sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light inundated the upper two blinds of our sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned our climate to high summer, but our feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still in shadow, and the sphere was lying upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a drift of snow.	^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And scattered here and there upon the slope, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphasised by little white threads of unthawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow upon their shady sides, were shapes like</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticks, dry twisted sticks of the same rusty hue</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the rock upon which they lay. That caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's thoughts sharply. Sticks! On a lifeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">world?

"Eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  How can I describe the thing I saw? It is so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">petty a thing to state, and yet it seemed so wonder-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ful, so pregnant with emotion. I have said that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">amidst the stick-like litter were these rounded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bodies, these little oval bodies that might have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passed as very small pebbles. And now first one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and then another had stirred, had rolled over and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cracked, and down the crack of each of them show-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ed a minute line of yellowish green, thrusting out-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ward to meet the hot encouragement of the newly-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">risen sun. For a moment that was all, and then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there stirred and burst a third!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "It is a seed," said Cavor. And then I heard him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whisper very softly, "Life!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Life!" And immediately it poured upon us that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our vast journey had not been made in vain, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we had come to no arid waste of minerals, but to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a world that lived and moved! We watched in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. tensely. I remember I kept rubbing the glass be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fore me with my sleeve, jealous of the faintest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suspicion of mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The picture was clear and vivid only in the mid-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dle of the field. All about that centre the dead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fibres and seeds were magnified and distorted by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the curvature of the glass. But we could see</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enough! One after another all down the sunlit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slope these miraculous little brown bodies burst and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gaped apart, like seed-pods, like the husks of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fruits; opened eager mouths that drank in the heat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and light pouring in a cascade from the newly-risen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Every moment more of these seed-coats ruptured,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and even as they did so the swelling pioneers over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flowed their rent-distended seed-cases, and passed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the second stage of growth. With a steady</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">assurance, a swift deliberation, these amazing seeds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thrust a rootlet downward to the ground and a queer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little bundle-like bud into the air. In a little while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the whole slope was dotted with minute plantlets</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">standing at attention in the blaze of the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They did not stand for long. The bundle-like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">buds swelled and strained and opened with a jerk,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thrusting out a coronet of little sharp tips, spread-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing a whorl of tiny, spiky, brownish leaves, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthened rapidly, lengthened visibly even as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched. The 'movement was slower than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal's, swifter than any plant's I have ever seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. How can I suggest it to you--the way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth went on? The leaf tips grew so that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved onward even while we looked at them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown seed-case shrivelled and was absorbed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an equal rapidity. Have you ever on a cold day</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken a thermometer into your warm hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the little thread of mercury creep up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube? These moon plants grew like that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes, as it seemed, the buds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more forward of these plants had lengthened into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stem and were even putting forth a second whorl</seg><seg type="columnLine">of leaves, and all the slope that had seemed so</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently a lifeless stretch of litter was now dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the stunted olive-green herbage of bristling</seg><seg type="columnLine">spikes that swayed with the vigour of their grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned about, and behold! along the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of a rock to the eastward a similar fringe in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scarcely less forward condition swayed and bent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark against the blinding glare of the sun. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond this fringe was the silhouette of a plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, branching clumsily like a cactus, and swelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">visibly, swelling like a bladder that fills with air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then to the westward also I discovered that an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other such distended form was rising over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrub. But here the light fell upon its sleek sides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I could see that its colour was a vivid orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">hue. It rose as one watched it; if one looked away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it for a minute and then back, its outline had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed; it thrust out blunt congested branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">until in a little time it rose a coralline shape of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many feet in height. Compared with such a growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrestrial puff-ball, which will sometimes swell</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot in diameter in a single night, would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless laggard. But than the puff-ball grows</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a gravitational pull six times that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon. Beyond, out of gullies and flats that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been hidden from us, but not from the quickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, over reefs and banks of shining rock, a bristling</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard of spiky and fleshy vegetation was straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view, hurrying tumultuously to take advantage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the brief day in which it must flower and fruit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seed again and die. It was like a miracle, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth. So, one must imagine, the trees and plants</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose at the Creation and covered the desolation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new-made earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Imagine it! Imagine that dawn! The resur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection of the frozen air, the stirring and quicken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the soil, and then this silent uprising of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetation, this unearthly ascent of fleshiness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spikes. Conceive it all lit by a blaze that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the intensest sunlight of earth seem watery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and weak. And still around this stirring jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherever there was shadow, lingered banks of bluish</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow.

Rentland turned the coupe skill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully out into the swept path of the street, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly down Fifth Avenue to Fourteenth Street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stopped three streets to the east before a house</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle of the block. The house was as nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row and cramped and as cheaply constructed as its</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors on both sides. It had lace curtains con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spicuous in every window, and with impressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">statuettes, vases, and gaudy bits of bric-a-brac in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front rooms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He told me again that Will must still be off</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk; and Will never takes a drink," she spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them for the first time, as they entered the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'He' is Welter," Rentland explained to Trant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" 'Will' is Morse, the missing man.

It imports almost everything--</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobacco, sugar, coffee, olives, and preserved fruits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oils, and all sorts of table delicacies, from all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world, even from Borneo, Mr. Trant, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madagascar and New Zealand. It has big ware-</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses at the docks with millions of dollars' worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of goods stored in them. My stepfather has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the company for years, and has charge of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that goes on at the docks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Including the weighing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; everything on which there is a duty when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is taken off the boats has to be weighed, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do this there are big scales, and for each one a scale</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. When a scale is being used there are two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the scale house. One of these is the Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment weigher, who sets the scale to a balance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes down the weight in a book. The other man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is an employee of the company, writes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight also in a book of his own; and he is called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the company's checker. But though there are half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen scales, almost everything, when it is pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, is unloaded in front of Scale No. 3, for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the best berth for ships."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And Landers?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Landers was the company's checker on scale No.</seg><seg type="columnLine">3. Well, about five weeks ago I began to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Landers was troubled about something. Twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">a queer, quiet little man with a scar on his cheek</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to see him, and each time they went up to Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Landers' room and talked a long while. Ed's room</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over the sitting room, and after the man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone I could hear him walking back and forth--</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking and walking until it seemed as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never stop. I told father about this man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who troubled Mr. Landers, and he asked him about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but Mr. Landers flew into a rage and said it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of importance. Then one night--it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wednesday--everybody stayed late at the docks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to finish unloading the steamer Covallo. About two</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock father got home, but Mr. Landers had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been ready to come with him. He did not come all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night, and the next day he did not come home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Mr. Trant, they are very careful at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warehouses about who goes in and out, because so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many valuable things are stored there. On one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warehouses open on the docks, and at each end</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are fenced off so that you cannot go along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">docks and get away from them that way; and on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side they open on the street through great</seg><seg type="columnLine">driveway doors, and at every door, as long as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is open, there stands a watchman, who sees every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body that goes in and out. Only one door was open</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Wednesday night, and the watchman there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seen Mr. Landers go out. And the second night</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, and he did not come home. But the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, Friday morning," the girl caught her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath hysterically, "Mr. Landers' body was found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the engine room back of scale house No. 3, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face crushed in horribly!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was the engine room occupied?" said Trant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. "It must have been occupied in the day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and probably on the night when Landers dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, as they were unloading the Cavdlo, But</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN HIGHER UP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">795</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the night after which the body was found--was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it occupied that night ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know, Mr. Trant. I think it could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been, for after the verdict of the coroner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">jury, which was that Mr. Landers had been killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some part of the machinery, it was said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accident must have happened either the eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning before, just bfore the engineer shut off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines, or the first thing that morning, just after</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had started them; for otherwise somebody in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine room would have seen it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But where had Landers been all day Thursday,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Rowan, from two o'clock on the second night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, when your father last saw him, until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">accident in the engine room?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was supposed he had been drunk. When his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was found, his clothes were covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fibers from the coffee-sacking, and the jury sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed he had been sleeping off his liquor in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee warehouse during Thursday. But I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known Ed Landers for almost three years, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that time I never knew him to take even one</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then it was a very unlikely supposition. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not believe in that accident, Miss Rowan ?" Trant</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, brusquely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl grew white as paper. "Oh, Mr. Trant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't know! I did believe in it. But since Will</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Mi\ Morse--has disappeared in exactly the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, under exactly the same circumstances, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone acts about it exactly the same way-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say the circumstances of Morse's disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance were the same?" Trant pressed quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she was able to proceed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After Mr. Landers had been found dead," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl, pulling herself together again, "Mr. Morse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been checker in one of the other scale</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses, was made checker on scale No. 3. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised at that, for it was a sort of promotion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">father did not like Will; he had been greatly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased at our engagement. Will's promotion made</seg><seg type="columnLine">us very happy, for it seemed as though father must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be changing his opinion. But after Will had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">checker on scale No. 3 only a few days, the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer, quiet little man with the scar on his cheek</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had begun coming to see Mr. Landers before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was killed began coming to see Will, too! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">after he began coming, Will was troubled, terribly</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled, I could see; but he would not tell me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason. And he expected, after that man began</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming, that something would happen to him. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know, from the way he acted and spoke about Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Landers, that he thought he had not been accident-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally killed. One evening, when I could see he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been more troubled than ever before, he said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if anything happened to him I was to go at once to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boarding house and take charge of everything in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his room, and not to let anyone into the room to</seg><seg type="columnLine">search it until I had removed everything in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bureau drawers; everything no matter how</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless anything seemed. Then, the very next</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, five days ago, just as while Mr. Landers was</seg><seg type="columnLine">checker, everybody stayed overtime at the docks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish unloading a vessel, the Elizabethan Age. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning Will's landlady called me on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone to tell me that he.had not come home. Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">days ago, Mr. Trant! And since then no one has</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen or heard from him; and the watchman did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">see him come out of the warehouse that night just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he did not see Ed Landers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did you find in Morse's bureau?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I found nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing?" Trant repeated. "That is impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, Miss Rowan! Think again! Remember he</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned you that what you found might seem trivial</seg><seg type="columnLine">and useless."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl, a little defiantly, studied for an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trant's clear-cut features. Suddenly she arose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran from the room, but returned quickly with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange little implement in her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was merely a bit of wire, straight for perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">three inches, and then bent in a half circle of five</seg><seg type="columnLine">or six inches, the bent portion of the wire being</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound carefully with stout twine, thus:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The mysterious string-wrapped piece of bent wire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Except for his clothes and some blank writing</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper and envelopes that was absolutely the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the bureau.

"Will had told me not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say anything; and I told you father did not like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Will. He had made up his mind that I was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry Ed Landers. In most ways father is kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and generous. He's kept the coupe we came here in</seg><seg type="columnLine">for mother and me for two years; and you see,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she gestured a little proudly about the bedecked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly furnished rooms, "you see how he gets every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for us. Mr. Landers was most generous, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took me to the theaters two or three times every</seg><seg type="columnLine">week--always the best seats, too. I didn't want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go, but father made me. I preferred Will, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wasn't so generous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Trant's eyes returned, with more intelligent scru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny, to the mysterious implement in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What salary do checkers receive, Rentland?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, in a low tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One hundred and twenty-five dollars a month."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And her father, the dock superintendent--how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much?" Trant's expressive glance now jumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">about from one gaudy, extravagant trifle in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room to another, caught a glimpse again of the elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric coupe standing in the street, then returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny bit of wire in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three thousand a year," Rentland replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me, Miss Rowan," said Trant, "this imple-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment--have you by any chance mentioned it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">President Welter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, no, Mr. Trant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are sure of that?

The landlady not only allowed them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait in her little parlor, but waited with them un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til at the end of an hour she pointed with an eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture to a short man in a big ulster who turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply up the front steps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's him--see!" she exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That the man with the scarl" cried Rentland.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well!

"What</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you doing in this case? Trant, this i3 Inspec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor Dickey, of the Customs Office," he introduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm in the case on my own hook, if I know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">case you're talking about," piped Dickey.

"What were</seg><seg type="columnLine">you calling to see Landers for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know about that?" The little man looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up sharply. "Well, six weeks ago Landers came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me and told me he had something to sell; a secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">system for beating the customs. But before we got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to terms, he began losing his nerve a little; he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">it back, however, and was going to tell me when, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once, he disappeared, and two days later he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead! That made it hotter for me; so I went after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morse. But Morse denied he knew anything. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morse disappeared, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you got nothing at all out of them?" Rent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land interposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing I could use. Landers, one time when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was getting up his nerve, showed me a piece of bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire--with string around it--in his room, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan telling me something when Rowan called him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he shut up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A bent wire!" Trant cried, eagerly. "lake this?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took from his pocket the implement given him</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Edith Rowan. "Morse had this in his room, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only thing in a locked drawer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The same thing!"

We need only go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the docks and watch them while they weigh, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how they use it, and arrest them and then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have them at last, eh, old man?" he cried in triumph.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We have them at last!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean," Trant cut in upon the customs man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that you can convict and jail perhaps the checker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a foreman, or maybe even a dock superintendent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--as usual.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a taste, I make a smell, or I make a noise to</seg><seg type="columnLine">excite feeling in the subject; and I read by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plethysmograph that the volume of blood in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand decreases under the emotions and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN HIGHER UP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">797</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse quickens; and by the pneumograph I read that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breathing is easier or quicker, depending on</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the emotions are pleasant or unpleasant. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have performed this year more than two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those experiments."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good! I have a problem in which you can be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very greatest use to me; and the plethysmo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph and the pneumograph will serve my purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as any other instruments in the laboratory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For no matter how hardened a man may be, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter how impossible it may have become to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tect his feelings in his face or bearing, he cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent the volume of blood in his hand from de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing, and his breathing from becoming dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent, under the influence of emotions of fear or</seg><seg type="columnLine">guilt. By the way, professor, is Mr. Welter familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">with these experiments of yours?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What, he!" cried the stout German. "For why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should I tell him about them? He knows nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He has bought my time to instruct classes; he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">not bought, py chiminey! everything--even the soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gott gave me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But he would be interested in them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To be sure, he would be interested in them! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring in his automobile three or four other</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat money-makers, and he would show off before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He would make his trained bear--that is me</seg><seg type="columnLine">--dan'ie!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!" cried Trant again, excitedly. "Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmalz, would you be willing to give a little exhi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bition of the plethysmograph and pneumograph, thi3</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening, if possible, and arrange for President Wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter to attend it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The astute German cast on him a quick glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of interrogation. "Why not?" he said. "It makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to me what purpose you will be carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">out; no, py chiminey! not if it costs me my posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of trained bear; because I have confidence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my psychology that it will not make any innocent</seg><seg type="columnLine">man suffer!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you will have two or three scientists present</seg><seg type="columnLine">to watch the experiments?

Trant leaped to his feet.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanity will arrange it if I assure the greatest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">publicity-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The more publicity the better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wait! It shall be fixed before you leave here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The professor led the way into his private study,</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephoned to the president of the American Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modities Company, and made the appointment with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes before eight o'clock that evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trant again mounted rapidly the stone steps to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor's laboratory. The professor and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, who were bending over a table in the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of the room, turned at his entrance. President</seg><seg type="columnLine">Welter had not yet arrived. The young psycholo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gist acknowledged with pleasure the introduction to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two scientists with Schmalz. Both of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to him by name, and he had been following</seg><seg type="columnLine">with interest a series of experiments, whieh the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elder, Dr. Annerly, had been reporting in a psycho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical journal. Then he turned at once to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus on the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was still examining the instruments when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise of a motor car stopping at the door warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him of the arrival of President Welter's party.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the laboratory door opened and the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. They also were three in number; stout</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, rather obtrusively dressed, in jovial spirits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with strong faces flushed now with the wine they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken at dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, professor, what fireworks are you going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show us to-night?" asked Welter, patronizingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Schmalz," he explained to his companions, "is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief ringmaster of this circus."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bearded face of the German grew purple un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der Welter's jokingly overbearing manner; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the instruments and began to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The pneumograph, which the professor first</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up, consists of a very thin flexible brass plate</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended by a cord around the neck of the person</seg><seg type="columnLine">under examination, and fastened tightly against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chest by a cord circling the body. On the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of this plate are two small, bent levers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected at one end to the cord around the body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subject, and at the other end to the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a small hollow drum fastened to the plate be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the two. As the chest rises and falls in</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing, the levers press more and less upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the drum; and this varying pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the air inside the drum is transmitted from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum through an air-tight tube to a little pencil</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it lowers and raises. The pencil, as it rises</seg><seg type="columnLine">and falls, touching always a sheet of smoked paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling over a cylinder on the recording device,</seg><seg type="columnLine">traces a line whose rising strokes represent accu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rately the drawing of air into the chest and whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling represents its expulsion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was clear to Trant that the professor's rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation, though plain enough to the psycholo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gists already familiar with the device, was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly understood by the big men. It had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained to them that changes in the breathing so</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight as to be imperceptible to the eye would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorded unmistakably by the moving pencil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Schmalz turned to the second instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. This was a plethysmograph, designed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure the increase or decrease of the size of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger of a person under examination as the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply to that finger becomes greater or less. It con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sists primarily of a small cylinder so constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it can be fitted over the finger and made air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight. Increase or decrease of the size of the finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">then increases or decreases the air pressure inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinder. These changes in the air pressure are</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitted through an airtight tube to a delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">piston which moves a pencil and makes a line upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the record sheet just under that made by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pneumograph. The upward or downward trend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this line shows the increase or decrease of the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply, while the smaller vibrations up and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">record the pulse beat in the finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is still a third'pencil touching tha record</seg><seg type="columnLine">798</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet above the other two and wired electrically to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a key like that of a telegraph instrument fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the table. When this key is in its normal position</seg><seg type="columnLine">this pencil makes simply a straight line upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet; but instantly when the key is pressed down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line breaks downward also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This third instrument is used merely to record</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sheet, by the change in the line, the point at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the object that arouses sensation or emotion</seg><seg type="columnLine">is displayed to the person undergoing examination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The instant's silence which followed Schmalz's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid explanation was broken by one of Welter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions with the query:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what's the use of all this stuff, any way?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ach!" said Schmalz, bluntly, "it is interesting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious! I will show you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will one of you gentlemen," said Trant, quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"permit us to make use of him in the demonstra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Try it, Jim," Welter laughed, noisily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not I," said the other. "This is your circus."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, indeed it's mine. And I'm not afraid of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmalz, do your worst!" He dropped, laughing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the chair the professor set for him, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmalz's direction unbuttoned his vest. The pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor hung the pneumograph around his neck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened it tightly about the big chest. He laid Wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter's forearm in a rest suspended from the ceiling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and attached the cylinder to the second finger of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plump hand. In the meantime Trant had quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">set the pencils to bear upon the record sheet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had started the cylinder on which the sheet traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">under them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, I have prepared for you." Schmalz</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted a napkin from a tray holding several little</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishes. He took from one of these a bit of caviar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and'laid it upon Welter's tongue. At the same in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant Trant pushed down the key. The pencils</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed a slight commotion, and the spectators</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at this record sheet!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ach!" exclaimed Schmalz, "you do not like</seg><seg type="columnLine">caviar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"How do you know that?" demanded Welter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The instruments show that at the unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste you breathe less freely--not so deep. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger, as under strong sensation or emotions, grows</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller, and your pulse beats more rapidly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the Lord! Welter, what do you think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?" cried one of his companions; "Your finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets smaller when you taste caviar!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a joke to them. Boisterously laughing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they tried Welter with other food upon the tray;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they lighted for him one of the black cigars of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he was most fond, and watched the trembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">pencils write the record of his pleasure at the taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smell. Through it all Trant waited, alert,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchful, biding the time to carry out his plan. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">came when, having exhausted the articles at hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they paused to find some other means to carry on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amusement. The young psychologist leaned for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is no great ordeal after all, is it, Mr. Welter?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "Modern psychology does not put its sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects to torture like"--he halted, meaningly -- "a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner in the Elizabethan Age!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Annerly, bending over the record sheet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered a startled exclamation. Trant, glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">keenly at him, straightened triumphantly. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young psychologist did not pause. He took quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his pocket a photograph, showing merely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap of empty coffee sacks piled carelessly to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of some two feet along the inner wall of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed, and laid it in front of the subject. Welter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face did not alter; but again the pencils shuddered</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the moving paper, and the watchers stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with astonishment. Rapidly removing the photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph, Trant substituted for it the bent wire given</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by Miss Rowan. Then for the last time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung to the instrument, and as his eyes caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wildly vibrating pencils, they flared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> President Welter rose abruptly, but not too hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly. "That's about enough of this tomfoolery,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, with perfect self-possession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His jaw had imperceptibly squared to the watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful determination of the prize fighter driven into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. His cheek still held the ruddy glow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">health; but the wine flush had disappeared from it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was perfectly sober.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Trant tore the strip of paper from the instrument,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and numbered the last three reactions 1, 2, 3. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the way the records looked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">/YVVVvvmmYv\/y\</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^Record of the reaction when Trant said: "A_</seg><seg type="columnLine">'' prisoner in the Elizabethan Age I " ^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fRc$ord vtade nihen Welter saw the photograph of</seg><seg type="columnLine">' a heap of cojjee sacks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Amazing!" said Dr. Annerly. "Mr. Welter, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am curious to know what associations you have with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that photograph and bent wire, the sight of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused in you such strong emotion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By immense self-control, the president of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">" THE MAN HIGHER UP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">799</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">American Commodities Company met his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly. "None," he answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Impossible! No psychologist, knowing how this</seg><seg type="columnLine">record was taken, could look at it without feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely certain that the photograph and spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused in you such excessive emotion that I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to give it, without further words, the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 'intense fright!' But if we have inadvertently</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised a secret, we have no desire to pry into it</seg><seg type="columnLine">further. Is it not so, Mr. Trant?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the name President Welter whirled suddenly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Trant! Is your name Trant?" he demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, I've heard of you." His eyes hardened. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man like you goes just so far, and then--somebody</seg><seg type="columnLine">stops him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As they stopped Landers?" Trant inquired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come, we've seen enough, I guess," said Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent Welter, and, including for one instant in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">now frankly menacing gaze both Trant and Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor Schmalz, turned to the door, closely followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companions. And a moment later the quick ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosions of his automobile were heard. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound, Trant seized suddenly a large envelope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped into it the photograph and wire he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just used, sealed, signed, and dated it, signed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dated also the record from the instruments, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly handed all to Dr. Annerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doctor, I trust this to you," he cried, excitedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It will be best to have them attested by all three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you.

Above all, do not let the record itself out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your hands until I come for it. It is important</seg><seg type="columnLine">--extremely important! As for me, I have not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment to lose!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seized his hat and dashed from the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving them in an astonished group.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young psychologist sped down the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps of the laboratory three at a time, ran at top</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed to the nearest street corner, turned it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped into a waiting taxicab. "The American Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modities Company's dock in Brooklyn," he shouted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and never mind the speed limits!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rentland and the chauffeur, awaiting him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, galvanized at his coming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hot work?" the custom's agent asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It may be very hot; but we have the start of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him," Trant replied as the car shot ahead. "Welter</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself is coming to the docks to-night, I think, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the look of him! He left just before me, but must</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop his friends first. He suspects, now, that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">know; but he cannot be aware that we know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are unloading to-night. He probably counts on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our waiting to catch them at the cheating to-mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row morning. So he's going over to-night himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I size him up right, to order it stopped and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">move all traces before we can prove anything. Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickey waiting?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you give the word he is to take us in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch them at it. If Welter himself comes, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, it will not change the plan?" Rentland asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not at all," said Trant, "for I have him already.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He will deny everything, of course, but it's too late</seg><seg type="columnLine">now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big ear, with unchecked speed, swung down</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broadway, slowed after a twenty-minutes/-run to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cross the Brooklyn Bridge, and, turning to the left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged once more at high speed into the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rower and less well-kept thoroughfares of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brooklyn water front. Two minutes later it over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a little electric coupe, bobbing excitedly down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sloping street. As they passed it, Trant caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the illuminated number hanging at its rear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouted suddenly to the chauffeur, who brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">his car to a stop a hundred feet beyond. The psy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chologist, leaping down, ran into the road before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Rowan," he cried to its single occupant, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came to a stop. "Why are you coming over here</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this time to-night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it's you, Mr. Trant!" She opened the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing relief in the recognition. "Oh, I'm so</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried. I'm on my way to see father; for a tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gram just came to him from Boston; mother opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and told me to take it to him at once, as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">most important. She wouldn't tell me what it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, but it excited her a great deal. Oh, I'm so</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid it must be about Will and that was why she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't tell me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From Boston?" Trant pressed quickly. Having</seg><seg type="columnLine">her confidence, the girl nervously read the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gram aloud by the light of the coup6's side lamps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it read:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Police have taken your friend out of our hands;</seg><seg type="columnLine">look out for trouble.

Rentland, behind them, motioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bloated, menacing figure had suddenly swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear of the group of dock laborers--a roustabout,</seg><seg type="columnLine">goaded to desperation, with a fist raised against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">puny superior. But before the blow had fallen an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fist, huge and black, struck the man over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rowan's shoulder with a hammer. He fell, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dock superintendent passed on without a back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward glance, the giant negro who had struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow following in his footsteps like a dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The black," Rentland explained, "is Rowan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodyguard.

The single</seg><seg type="columnLine">window in the rear of No. 3 scale house had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitewashed to prevent anyone from looking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that side; but in spots the whitewash had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen off in flakes. Trant put his eye to one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these clear spots in the glass and looked in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scale table, supported on heavy posts, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended across almost the whole front of the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind a low, wide window, which permitted those</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated at the table to see all that occurred on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">docks. Toward the right end of the table sat the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government weigher; toward the left end, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated from him by almost the whole length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the table, sat the company checker. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the only persons in the scale house. Trant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after his first rapid survey of the scene, fixed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye upon the man who had taken the place which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Landers had held for three years, and Morse for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few days afterwards--the company checker. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck-load of tobacco bales was wheeled on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scales in front of the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch his left knee," Trant whispered quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly into Dickey's ear at the pane beside him, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance was being made upon the beam before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. As he spoke, the Government weigher ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justed the balance and they saw the left leg of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">company checker pressed hard against the post</seg><seg type="columnLine">which protected the scale rod at his end. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the scale house then read aloud the weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each entered it in the book on the table in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him. A second truckful was wheeled on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scale; and again, just as the Government weigher</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed his balances, the company checker, so incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spicuously as to make the act undiscoverable by</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fh.n.t Tirpr'jsp TTin'f*3. rr,Ti&lt;''l+Pd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the operation.

The man resisted; they struggled. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">the customs men protected him, Trant, wrenching</seg><seg type="columnLine">something from the post beside the checker's left</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee, rose with a cry of triumph. Then the psycho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logist, warned by a cry from Rentland, leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly to one side to avoid a blow from the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro. His quickness saved him; still the blow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing along his cheek, hurled him from his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He rose immediately, blood flowing from a super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial cut upon his forehead where it had struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scale-house wall. He saw Rentland covering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro with a revolver, and the two other customs</seg><seg type="columnLine">men arresting, at pistol point, the malignant little</seg><seg type="columnLine">dock superintendent, the checker, and the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had crowded into the scale house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see!" Trant exhibited to the customs offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cers a bit of bent wire, wound with string, precisely</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that the girl had given him that morning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had used in his test of Welter the hour before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It was almost exactly as we knew it must be I This</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring was stuck through a hole in the protecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">post so that it prevented the balance beam from ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing properly when bales were put on the platform.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A little pressure just at that point takes many</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds from each bale weighed.

A few days later I was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddled and poled up the Canazas River with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last outposts of civilization many miles behind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unknown jungles and the forbidden country of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild Kunas ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was with the greatest difficulty that I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to secure men to accompany me, for the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked with the utmost dread upon the Kuna coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try and only two, out 6f the scores I had asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were willing to tempt fate and risk their lives in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expedition into the unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For two days now we had been within the forbid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den district--the area guarded and held by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kunas and into which no outsider is permitted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter--and yet we had seen or heard no. signs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians. But I was too old a hand and too familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'ith the ways of South American Indians to delude</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself with the idea that we had not been seen or</seg><seg type="columnLine">our presence known. I well knew that, in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">likelihood, we had been watched and our every</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement known since the moment we entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">territory. No doubt, sharp black eyes were constant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly peering at us from the jungle, while bows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowguns were ever ready to discharge their mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siles of death at any instant. As long as we were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">molested or interfered with, however, I gave little</seg><seg type="columnLine">heed to this. Moreover, I believed, from my brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquaintance with the Kunas of two years previ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, that they seldom killed a white man until</seg><seg type="columnLine">after he had been warned out of their country and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to return to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At night we camped beside the river, making our</seg><seg type="columnLine">beds upon the warm dry sand and each day we</seg><seg type="columnLine">poled the cayuca up the rapids and deeper into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest. At last we reached the spot where, accord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to my calculations, we must strike through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle overland to reach the mountain seen by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hazen. Hiding our dugout in the thick brush be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the river we packed the few necessities to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried with us and started off through the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Hazen were not mistaken in his calculations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should reach the vicinity of the mountain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days' march, even though the going was hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we were compelled to hew a way with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">machetes for miles at a stretch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it's one thing to find a mountain top when</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying over the sea of jungle and quite another to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find that mountain when hidden deep in the forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and surrounded on every side by enormous trees. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that we might easily pass within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards of the spot and never suspect it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we might wander for days, searching for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain without finding it. It was largely a mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of luck after all. But Hazen had described the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding country so minutely, that I had high</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes of success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the end of the first day in the bush we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached rough and hilly country, which promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, and it was with the expectation of reaching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the mountain the following day that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">made camp that night. Still we had seen no Indians,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">no signs of their trails or camps, which did much</seg><seg type="columnLine">to calm the fears of my men and which I accounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for on the theory that the Kunas avoided this part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the country through superstitious fears of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost city and its people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At daybreak we broke camp and had tramped for</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps three hours when, without warning, Jose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was last in line, uttered a terrified cry. Turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing quickly I was just in time to see him throw up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands and fall in a heap with a long arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivering in his back. The Kunas were upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scarcely had the realization come to me when</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arrow thudded sharply into a tree by my side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlos, with a wild yell of deadly fear, threw down</seg><seg type="columnLine">his load and dashed madly away. Not an Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen. To stand there, a target for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">missiles, was suicidal, and turning, I fled at my ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most speed after Carlos. How we managed to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">through that tangled jungle is still a mystery to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, but we made good time, nevertheless. Fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove us and dodging between the giant trees, leap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fallen trunks, tripping over roots and scrambl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over rocks, wre sped on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, from behind, we could hear the sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pursuing Indians; their low gutteral cries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sounds of breaking twigs and branches; con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly they w'ere drawing nearer. I knew that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes they would be upon us--that at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant a poisoned blowgun dart or a barbed arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">might bury itself in my body; but still we strove</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, just as I felt that the end must be at hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">--just as I had decided to turn and sell my life dear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly--the forest thinned. Before us sunlight appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the next moment we dashed from the jungle in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a space free from underbrush but covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous trees draped with gnarled and twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">lianas. The land here rose sharply and, glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead between the trees, I saw the indistinct out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of a lofty mountain against the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toiling up the slope, breathing heavily, utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhausted, I kept on. Then, as a loud shout sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed from the rear, I turned to see five hideously</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted Kunas break from the jungle. But they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not follow. To my utter amazement they halted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a quick glance about, and, with a chorus of</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened yells, turned and dashed back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter of the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I had scant time to give heed to this. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kunas' cries were still ringing in my ears when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream from Carlos drew my attention. Thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him attacked by savages I rushed towards him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing my revolver as I ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With bulging, rolling eyes, blanched face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly, terror stricken features he was struggling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting madly, with a writhing, coiling gray ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject which I took for a gigantic snake. Already his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body and legs were bound and helpless in the coils.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With his machete he was raining blows upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivering awful thing which slowly, menacingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavered back and forth before him, striving to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw another coil about his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, as I drew near, my senses reeled, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that I was in some awful nightmare. The ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject, so surely, relentlessly, silently encircling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushing him was no serpent but a huge liana</seg><seg type="columnLine">drooping from the lofty branches of a great tree!</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH THE CRATER'S RIM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">809</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed absolutely incredible, impossible, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">believeable.

With a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell of terror I leaped aside.

At the blow the vine drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply back while from the gash a thick, yellow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish, stinking juice oozed forth. Turning, I started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rush from the accursed spot but as I passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first tree another liana writhed forward in my path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Utterly bereft of my senses, slashing madly as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran, yelling like a madman, I dodged from tree to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree, seeking the open spaces, evading by a hair's</seg><seg type="columnLine">breadth the fearful, menacing, aerpent-like vines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until half-crazy, torn, panting and utterly spent I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed forth into a clear grassy space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before me, rising like a sheer wall against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky was a huge precipitous cliff of red rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I knew why the Kunas had not followed us</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the jungle.

And then I saw what had before escaped me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The things were not lianas as I had thought. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were parts of the trees themselves--huge, lithe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flexible tentacles springing from a thick, fleshy</seg><seg type="columnLine">livid-hued crown of branches armed with stupend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous thorns and which slowly opened and closed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry jaws above the huge trunks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was monstrous, uncanny, supernatural. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards and more of open ground had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched between me and the forest when I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung myself down, but now a scant fifty paces re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained. In a few brief momenta the fearsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">things would be upon me. But I was petrified, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of moving hand or foot, too terrified and</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelmed even to cry out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nearer and nearer the ghastly things came. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the pounding of my heart. A cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat broke out on my body. I shivered as with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ague. Then a long, warty, tentacle darted towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and as the loathsome stinking thing touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hand the spell was broken. With a wild scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned and dashed blindly towards the precipice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking only to delay, only to avoid for a time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain awful death to which I was doomed, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff barred all escape and I could go no farther.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Amazing Discoveries</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A DOZEN leaps and I reached the wall of rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond which all retreat was cut off. Close</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hand was an out jutting buttress, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking that back of this I might hide and thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">prolong my life, I raced for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panting, unseeing, I reached the projection,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducked behind it, and to my amazement and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speakable delight, found myself in a narrow canyon</seg><seg type="columnLine">or defile, like a huge cleft in the face of the preci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was safety for a time. The terrible man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating trees could not enter, and striving only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put a greater distance between myself and the veg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etable demons I never slackened my pace as I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sped up the canyon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Narrower and narrower it became. Far above</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head the rocky walls leaned inward, shutting out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light until soon it was so dim and shadowy that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through sheer necessity, I was forced to stop run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning and to pick my way carefully over the masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rock that strewed the canyon's floor. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a narrow ribbon of sky was visible between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">towering walls of the pass. Then this was blotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and I found myself in the inky blackness of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel--an ancient watercourse--leading into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very bowels of the mountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was no use in hesitating. Anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">was preferable to the cannibal trees, and groping</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way I pressed on. Winding and twisting, turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sharply, the passageway led, ever ascending</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeply and taxing my exhausted muscles and over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought system to the utmost. Then, far ahead, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the faint sound of dripping, falling water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with joy at thought of burying my aching head in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cold liquid, and of easing my parched, dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, I hurried, stumbling, through the tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, I saw a glimmer of light in the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in it the sparkle of the water. Before me was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the tunnel and sunlight and with a final</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurt of speed I rushed towards it. Then, just as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained the opening, and so suddenly and unexpect</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly that he seemed to materialize from thin air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man rose before me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unable to check my speed, too thunderstruck at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apparition to halt, I dashed full into him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">together we rolled head over heels upon the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have said he was a man. But even in that brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">second that I glimpsed him, before I bowled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, I realized that he was unlike any man I or</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone else had ever seen. Barely three feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">height, squat, with enormous head and shoulders, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood shakily upon the tiniest of bandy legs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half supported his weight by his enormously long</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscular arms. Had it not been that he was partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">810</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">clothed and that his face wag hairless, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought him an ape. And now, as I picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself up and stared at him, my jaws gaped in ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter amazement. The fellow was running from me at</seg><seg type="columnLine">top speed upon his hands, his feet waving and sway-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the air!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So utterly dumbfounded was I at the sight that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there silently gazing after the strange being</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he vanished behind a clump of bushes. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it dawned upon me that no doubt there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">others near, and, that as he had shown no sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostility, they were likely peaceable, I hurried after</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A narrow trail led through the brush and running</seg><seg type="columnLine">along this I burst from the shrubbery and came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an abrupt halt, utterly astounded at the sight which</seg><seg type="columnLine">met my eyes. I was standing at the verge of a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise beyond which stretched an almost circular,</seg><seg type="columnLine">level plain several miles in diameter. Massed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">this in long rows, compact groups and huge squares,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hundreds of low, flat-roofed, stone buildings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while upon a smooth green plot at a little distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood a massive truncated pyramid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unwittingly I had reached my goal. Eefore me</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the lost city of Darien. Hazen had been right!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was not this thought nor the strange city</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its buildings that held my fascinated gaze, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people. Everywhere they swarmed. Upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets, the housetops, even on the open land of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain, they crowded and each and every one an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">act counterpart of the one with whom I had collided</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the mouth of the tunnel. And, like him too, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">were walking or running upon their hands with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet in air!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this I saw in the space of a few seconds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, to add to my astonishment, I saw that many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the impossible beings actually were carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">burdens in their upraised feet! Some bore baskets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">others jars or pots, others bundles, while one group</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was approaching in my direction, held bows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arrows in their toes, and held them most men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acingly at that!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was evident that I had been seen. The excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the beings, their gestures and the manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which they peered towards me from between</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arms, left no doubt of it, while the threaten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing defensive attitude of the bowmen proved that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were ready to attack or defend at a moment's</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No doubt, to them, my appearance was as re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable, as inexplicable and as amazing as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to me. The greater portion were evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with terror and scurried into their houses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet many still stood their ground, while a few were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so overcome with curiosity and surprise that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">dx-opped feet to earth and rested right side up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to stare at me more intently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I realized that it behooved me to do something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To stand there motionless and speechless, gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the strange folk while they stared back, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplish nothing. But what to do, what move to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make? That was a serious question. If I attempt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to approach them a shower of arrows might well</seg><seg type="columnLine">end my career and my investigations of the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">then and there. It was equally useless to retrace</seg><seg type="columnLine">my steps, even had I been so minded, for only cer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tain death lay back of me. By some means I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">win the confidence or friendship of these outland-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish beings if only temporarily. A thousand ideas</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed through my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If only Hazen would appear the creatures of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city might think I had dropped from the sky and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">look upon me as a supernatural being. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless to expect such a coincidence or to look for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. I had told him to fly over on the tenth day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this was only the seventh. If only I had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained my revolver the discharge of the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">might frighten them into thinking me a god. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">my firearms lay somewhere in the demon forest. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard no sounds of voices, no shouting, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if the beings were dumb. Maybe, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, if I should speak--should yell---I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">impress them. But, on the other hand, the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my voice might break the spell and cause them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attack me. A single mistake, the slightest false</seg><seg type="columnLine">move, might seal my doom. I was in a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">quandary. All my former experiences with savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown tribes passed through my mind, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove to think of some incident, some little event,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had saved the day in the past and might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">put to good use now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as I thus pondered I unconsciously reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my pocket for my pipe, filled it with tobacco and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing it between my lips, struck a match and</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed forth a cloud of smoke. Instantly, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird creatures, a low, wailing, sibilant sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose. The archers dropped their bows and arrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, with one accord, the people threw themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">grovelling on the ground. Unintentionally I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved the problem. To these beings I was a fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing, awful god!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Realizing this, knowing that when dealing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive races full of superstitions one must in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly follow up an advantage, I hesitated no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer. Puffing lustily at my pipe I strode forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and approached the nearest prostrate group. Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionless they buried their faces in the dust, bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed to earth, not daring to look up or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">steal a surreptitious glance at the terrible, smoke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">belching being who towered over them. Never had</seg><seg type="columnLine">I seen such a demonstration of abject fear, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter debasement. It really was pitiful to see them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to view their trembling, panting bodies quivering</seg><seg type="columnLine">with nameless terror; terror so great they dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">not flee, even though they knew by my footsteps</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was among them, and feared that at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment an awful doom might descend upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But their very fright defeated my purpose. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">won safety and even adoration perhaps, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be no amity, no intercourse, no means _of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingling with them, of securing food, of learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything if they were to remain cowering on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. By some means I must win a measure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their confidence, I must prove that I was a friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneficent deity and yet I must still be able to im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press them with my powers and control them</seg><seg type="columnLine">through fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a delicate matter to accomplish, but it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be done. Almost at my feet lay one of the arch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers--a leader or chieftain I thought from the feath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er ornaments he wore--and stooping, I lifted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently. At my touch he fairly palpitated with ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH THE CRATER'S RIM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">811</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ror, but no frightened scream, no sound save an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn snake-like hiss, escaped his lips, and he of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered no resistance as I lifted him to a kneeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hitherto I had hid no opportunity to obtain a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good view of these peopla, but now I saw this fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low close at hand I was amazed at his repulsive</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugliness. I have seen some rather ugly races, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of them combined and multiplied a hundredfold</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be beauties compared to these dwarfed, top-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sy-turvy, denizens of the lost city. Almost black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">low browed, with tiny, shifty eyes like those of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reptile, with enormous, thick lipped mouths, sharp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fang-like teeth and matted hair, the bowman</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed far more like an ape than like a human be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. And then I noticed a most curious thing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no ears! Where they should have been were</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely round, bare spots covered with light colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin membrane like the ears of a frog. For an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant I thought it a malformation or an injury. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I glanced at the others I saw that all were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same. Not one possessed a human ear! All this I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took in as I lifted the fellow up. Then as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremblingly raised his head and eyed me I spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, trying to make ray tones gentle and reassuring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there was no response, no sign of intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">or understanding in his dull, frightened eyes. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing to do but to fall back on sign language</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rapidly I gestured, striving to convey to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I would do no injury or harm, that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly and that I wished the people to rise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly a look of comprehension dawned upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly face and then, to prove my friendship, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fished in my pocket, found a. tiny mirror and placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in his hand. At the expression of utter astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that overspread his ugly features as he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the glass I roared with laughter. But the mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror won the day. Uttering sharp, strange, hissing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds, the fellow conveyed the news to his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions and slowly, hesitatingly and with lingering</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear still on their faces, the people rose and gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me with strangely mingled awe and curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mainly they were men, but scattered among them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were many who evidently were women, although all</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so uniformly repulsive in features that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult to distinguish the sexes. All too, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad much alike in single garments of bark-cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling gunnysacks with holes cut at the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners for legs and arms and an opening for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But while there was no variation in the form</seg><seg type="columnLine">or material of the clothing yet some wore orna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and others did not. Leg and arm bands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">woven fibre were common. Many of the men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decorations of bright hued feathers attached to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms or legs or fastened about their waists and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many were elaborately tattooed. That such primi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive dwarfed, ugly, degenerate creatures could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">built the city of stone houses, could have laid out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broad paved streets and could have developed so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of civilization, seemed incredible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I had little time to devote to such thoughts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fellow I had presented with the mirror was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissing at me like a serpent and by signs was try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to indicate that I was to follow him. So, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd trailing behind us, we started up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road towards the centre of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            Before the King</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TIULY no stranger jJrocession had ever been</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen by human eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Before me, the chief archer led the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking upon his great calloused hands and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bow grasped firmly in one prehensile foot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his precious mirror in the other. On either side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the rear were scores of the weird beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying along on their hands, keeping up an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessant hissing sound like escaping steam; black</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs and feet waving and gesticulating in air and, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first glance, appearing like a crowd of headless</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarfs. How I wished that Fenton might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">there to see!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently my actions had been closely watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the safe retreats of the houses and word pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed that I was not to be feared, for as we reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first buildings, the edges of the roofs and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny window slits were lined with curious, ugly faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering at us. It was then that I noticed that none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the buildings had doors, the walls rising blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the roofs save for the narrow windows, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladders, here and there in place, proved that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants, like the Pueblo Indians, entered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left their dwellings through the roofs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now and then as we passed along, some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more venturesome beings would join the procession,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambling nimbly down the ladders, sometimes up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side down on their hands, often using both hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feet, but always using hands only as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they reached the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How or why they had developed this extraor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary mode of progression puzzled me greatly, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there seemed no scientifically good reason for it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Among tribes who habitually use boats, weak legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enormously developed shoulders, chests and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms are common, and I could well understand how</seg><seg type="columnLine">a race, depending entirely upon water for trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portation, might, through generations of inbreed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and isolation, lose the use of legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But here was a people who apparently had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyances of any kind, who must of necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel about to cultivate their crops, who must</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry heavy burdens in order to construct their</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings and to whom legs would seem a most im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant matter, and yet with legs and feet so</seg><seg type="columnLine">atrophied and arms so tremendously developed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they walked on their hands and used their feet as</seg><seg type="columnLine">auxiliaries. It was a puzzle I longed to solve and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I would have investigated thoroughly had fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted me to dwell longer in the strange city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I am getting ahead of my story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently we reached a large central square sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by closely set buildings. Approaching one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these, my guide signalled that I was to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as he swiftly ascended the ladder to the roof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rather hesitatingly, for I doubted if the frail affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">would support my weight, I climbed gingerly up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found myself upon the broad, flat roof.

At the bottom of the ladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was in a large, obscure room, lit only by the slits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of windows high in the walls, and for a moment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see nothing of my surroundings, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all sides issued the low hissing sounds that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">now knew were the language of these remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. Then, as my eyes became accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dim light, I saw that a score of beings were</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted about the sides of the room, while, directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me, on a raised dais or platform, was seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the largest and ugliest individual I had seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That he was a ruler, a king or high priest, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident. In place of the sack-like garment of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">people he was clad in a long robe of golden green</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers. Upon his head was a feather crown of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same hue. About his wrists and ankles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden bands studded with huge uncut emeralds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a string of the same stones hung upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The throne, if such it could be called, was draped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a green and gold rug and everywhere, upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of the chamber, were paintings of strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">misshapen, uncouth creatures and human beings all</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same green and yellow tints. Something in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surroundings, in the drawings and the costume</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the king, reminded me of the Aztecs or Mayas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and while quite distinct from either I felt sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, in some long past time, these dwellers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost city had been influenced by or had been in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact with, these ancient civilizations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I stood before the dais my guide prostrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself before the green robed monarch and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising, carried on what appeared to be an animated</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of my arrival and the subsequent happen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he spoke, silence fell upon those present and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the king listened attentively, glancing now and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me and regarding me with an expression of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bined fear, respect and enmity. I could readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand what his feelings were. No doubt he</seg><seg type="columnLine">•was a person of far greater intelligence than his</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjects, and while more or less afraid of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange being as myself, and superstitious enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think me supernatural, yet in me he saw a pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible usurper of his own power and prominence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, if he had dared, he would have been only too</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to have put me out of the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of the archer's narrative the fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed his mirror to the king who uttered a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamatory hiss as he saw his own ugly counten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance reflected in it. Forgetting court etiquette and</seg><seg type="columnLine">conventions in their curiosity, the others gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about and as the mirror passed from hand to hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">their amazement knew no bounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of these men I now saw were clad in green</seg><seg type="columnLine">or green and white and were evidently of high rank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">priests or courtiers I took it, but otherwise were</seg><seg type="columnLine">as undersized and repulsive as the common people</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the streets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly I was aroused from my contemplation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room and its occupants by my guide who</seg><seg type="columnLine">came close and by signs ordered me to perform the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle of smoking. Very ceremoniously and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately I drew out my pipe, filled it and struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">a match. At the bright flare of the flame king and</seg><seg type="columnLine">courtiers uttered a wailing hiss of fear and threw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves upon the floor. But they were of dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent stuff from their people, or else the guide had</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared them for the event, for the king soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his head, and glancing dubiously at me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding I had not vanished in fire and smoke, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he no doubt expected, he resumed his sitting pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture and in sharp tones ordered his fellows to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">likewise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But despite this it was very evident that he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friends were in dread of the smoke from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and nose while the tobacco fumes caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to sputter and cough and choke. This at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than even the king could stand, and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs he made it clear that he wished me to end</seg><seg type="columnLine">the demonstration of my fire eating ability. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rose, and, to my unbounded surprise, stood erect</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stepped forward like an ordinary mortal upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. Here was an extraordinary thing. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the king of a distinct race or stock or was the use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nether limbs for talking confined to the royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">family or to individuals?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a fascinating scientific problem to soive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no time to give it any consideration, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the king was now addressing me in his snake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like dialect and was trying hard to make his mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing clear by signs. For a moment I was at a loss,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but presently I grasped his meaning. He was asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">whence I had come, and from the frequency with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he pointed upward I judged he thought I.</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dropped from the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a brilliant idea occurred to me as I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered Hazen's story and his suggestion regard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his return by plane. Pointing upward I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best imitation of a motor's exhaust that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage. There was no doubt that the monarch</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped my meaning. He grinned, nodded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept his arm in a wide semicircle around his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently to represent the course of the plane when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hazen had flown over the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seemingly satisfied and, I judged, deeply impress-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed as well, he resumed his seat, gave a few orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his fellows and summoning my guide spoke a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few words to him. Thereupon the archer signalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to follow and led the way across the room. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I noticed that the king had not returned the mirror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ascending the ladder to the roof the fellow hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried across to a second building, scrambled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">another ladder and we entered a large room. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">one corner swung a large fiber hammock; in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">centre was spread a cloth decorated in green and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold, and as we entered two women appeared, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying handsome earthenware dishes of food</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose savory odors whetted my already ravenous</seg><seg type="columnLine">appetite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marvelous as it was to see these impossible beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying food in their uplifted feet and walking on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hands, yet I had now become somewhat ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed to the people and I was so famished that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hardly gave the upside down serving maids a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second glance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The food was excellent--consisting of vegetables,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of fricasseed game and luscious fruits--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as I ate my guide squatted near and regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with the fixed, half adoring, half frightened look</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one sees on the face of a strange puppy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I judged that he had been appointed my own per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH THE CRATER'S RIM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">813</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal guard or valet--it mattered little which--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was not sorry, for he seemed a fairly decent speci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of his race and we already had become pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">well accustomed to each other's signs and gestures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wishing to still further establish myself in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence, and feeling rather sorry for him because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the loss of his treasured mirror, I searched my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets for some other trinket. My possessions</seg><seg type="columnLine">however were limited. They consisted of a stub of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a leadpencil, a note book, a few coins, my handker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief, my watch, my pocketknife, a few loose pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridges, my pipe and tobacco and a box of</seg><seg type="columnLine">matches. As I drew all these out a sudden fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped me. I had barely a dozen matches remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and my supply of tobacco was perilously low.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What would happen when I could no longer pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce fire and smoke when called upon to do so?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I controlled my fears and comforted myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the thought that possibly, after having felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effects of tobacco smoke, the king would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon demand another miracle at my hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, before either matches or tobacco was exhaust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, something might well happen to solve any prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lems that might arise. Nevertheless I heartily wish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed that I had arranged with Hazen to bring supplies</seg><seg type="columnLine">in case they were needed and which he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily dropped as he flew over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would, I now realized, have proved an extreme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly impressive thing for the people to have seen me</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure my magic from the giant roaring bird in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky. But I had never of course dreamed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such adventures as I had met and could not possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">have foreseen the need of such things. Just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same I cursed myself for a stupid fool for not hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing provided for any contingency and especially for</seg><seg type="columnLine">not having arranged a series of signals with Hazen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, I was familiar with wigwagging and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided that, if necessity arose, It would be quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">feasible for me to signal to him by means of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief tied on a stick. Also, I felt a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier in my mind from knowing that near the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a splendid landing place for the plane and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hazen, if signalled, would unquestionably attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a descent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Truly it was not every explorer in a predicament</seg><seg type="columnLine">like mine who could count on being able to summon</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid from the clouds if worst came to worst or who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that a friend in an airplane would keep track</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his whereabouts. Indeed, I almost chuckled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought of being in this long lost city among</seg><seg type="columnLine">these incredible folk and yet within two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of the Canal and civilization and with another</seg><seg type="columnLine">American due to hover above--and even communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate with me--within the next three days. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all so dreamlike, so utterly preposterous that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely could force myself to believe it and, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">dined well and feeling desperately tired, I flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself into the hammock and almost instantly drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped off to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was still daylight when I awoke and the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">was empty. Ascending the ladder to the roof with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out meeting anyone, I climbed down the other lad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der to the street. Many people were about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">while a few* especially the women and children,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw themselves on their faces or scampered into</seg><seg type="columnLine">their houses at my approach, yet the majority</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">merely prostrated themselves for a moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then stood, supporting themselves in their ape-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and stared curiously at me. I had gone but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short distance when my valet came hurrying to- my</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. But he made no objections to my going where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wished and I was glad to see that my movements</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not to be hampered as I was anxious thorough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly to explore the city and its neighborhood. Curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn the purpose of the pyramidal structure I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had noticed I proceeded in that direction and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon in a part of the town given over to stalls, shops</seg><seg type="columnLine">and markets. There were also several workshops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as pottery makers', a woodworking shop and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a weaver's shop and I spent , some time watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the artizans at their work. Somehow, from seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people walk upon their hands, I had expected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see them perform their tasks with their feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came as something of a surprise to see these fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows using their hands like ordinary mortals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond this portion of the city the houses were</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered, the outlying buildings were more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">patched and out of repair and were very evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the' abode of the poorer classes, although the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitants I saw, and who retreated the instant they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw me, were exactly like all the others as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see, both in dress and feature. Passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">these huts, I crossed the smooth green field, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I now saw was a perfect landing place for the plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tethered to stakes and grazing on the grass were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of animals which, as I first noticed them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had taken for goats and cattle. But now I dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that they were all deer and tapirs. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great surprise to see these animals domesticated</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, after all, it was not remarkable, for I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have known, had I stopped to give the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, that goats, sheep and cattle were unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the aboriginal Americans and that this city and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its people, who had never been visited and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never communicated with other races, would of</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity be without these well known animals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moreover, I knew that the Mayas were supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have used tapirs as beasts of burden, and while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was standing there watching the creatures a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached riding astride a big tapir and driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second one loaded with bags of charcoal and gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den produce. Here then was a partial solution of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manner by which these weak, dwarfed people</seg><seg type="columnLine">built their stone houses. For with the powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant-like tapirs--and I noticed all were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant Baird's tapir which reaches a weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven or eight hundred pounds--they could easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">haul the blocks of stone from a quarry and by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tackle and inclined planes, could readily hoist</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stones to the tops of the walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had now reached the base of the pyramid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it a massive structure of the same flinty</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone as the other buildings. Running from base to</seg><seg type="columnLine">summit was a spiral path or stairway and instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew that it was a sacrificial pyramid exactly like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those used by the Aztecs and on which unfortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings were killed and sacrificed. This discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">still further confirmed my suspicions that these peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple were either of Aztec or Maya blood or had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">influenced by those races. Filled with curiosity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the altar on the summit I started up the sloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs. I was at first doubtful if my companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">814</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would permit this, for the structure was sacred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and doubtless only priests of the highest order were</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted upon it. Evidently, however, my guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that such a supernatural being or god as</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself had every right to invade the most sacred</seg><seg type="columnLine">places, and he offered no objection, but prostrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself at the base of the pyramid as I ascended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the summit I found, as I had expected, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrificial stone, a huge block elaborately carved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hieroglyphs and with channels to permit the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drain off, while, close at hand, was a massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">carved stone collar or yoke exactly like those which</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been found in Porto Rico and have so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled scientists. From the blood stains upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">this I felt sure it was used to hold down the victim's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and neck, while strong metal staples, set into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the p stone, indicated that the man destined for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrifice was spread-eagled and his ankles and wrists</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound fast to the rings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a most interesting spot from a scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">standpoint, but decidedly gruesome, while the stench</seg><seg type="columnLine">of putrefied blood and fragments of human flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to the stones was nauseating and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to retrace my steps and descend to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the top of the pyramid I had obtained a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the plain and city and I had noted that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">former was surrounded on all sides with steep cliffs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I realized that the plain was not a flat topped</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain as I had thought but the crater of an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct volcano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw no path, pass or opening by which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater-valley could be entered, but I knew there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the one by which I had arrived. As the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here on the mountain top, was still well above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon I decided to visit the entrance to the tunnel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I was anxious to know why the people should</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave this avenue open when, on every other side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were completely cut off from the outer world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Possibly, I thought, they knew of those horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">man-eating trees and trusted to them to guard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city from intruders. Or again, they might keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance guarded, for the fellow I had knocked over</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I dashed in had been at the tunnel mouth and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I knew he might have been an armed guard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely so thunderstruck at my precipitate ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance that he forgot his duties and his weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With such thoughts running through my mind I</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolled across the plain, past well-tilled gardens</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fields, in several of which I saw men ploughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with well made plows drawn by tapirs. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmers stopped their work and prostrated them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves as I passed, and it was evident that word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my celestial origin and supernatural character had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone forth to every inhabitant of the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following the path, I reached the little rise from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had first viewed the city and soon came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot where I had entered. Imagine my utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise when I saw no sign whatever of the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I was positive that I had not missed my way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I recognized the clumps of bushes and the forms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks, but there was no dark hole, no aperture</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cliff. Then, as I drew near to the precipice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I made an astounding discovery. Closely fitted into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rock and so like it that it had escaped my at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention, was an enormous stone door. How it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">operated, whether it was hinged or slid or whether</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it was pivoted, I could not determine. But that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered and concealed the entrance to the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was convinced. Why the people had left the tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel open as though to clear the way for me, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">they should have fitted a door to it, why they should</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever use the tunnel which could bring them only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the death-dealing forest, were problems which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not solve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any rate there was nothing to be gained by</seg><seg type="columnLine">staying there and I started back towards the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thinking to return by another route, I took a path</seg><seg type="columnLine">that led towards the opposite mountain side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently from ahead, I distinctly heard the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal striking stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oddly enough my mind had been so filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">other matters that I had hardly wondered how these</seg><seg type="columnLine">people cut or worked the hard stone. But now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my attention was attracted by the sound my curios-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity was aroused and I hurried forward. What metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wondered, did these people use? For metal I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it must be from the ringing, clinking noise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was I about to see hardened bronze tools in actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">use or had these marvelous folk discovered the use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of iron or steel? So astounding had been all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiences, so paradoxical and incredible every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I had seen, that I was prepared for almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything. I, or rather we, soon came to the verge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a deep pit wherein, laboring at great masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white stone, were scores of workmen. Standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">like skeletons among the blocks were derricks;</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitched to sledge-like drags loaded with stone were</seg><seg type="columnLine">teams of tapirs and on the farther side was a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">out jutting ledge from which the stone was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarried. Hurrying down the steep trail I reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the pit to find every man flat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Signalling to my companion that I wished to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fellows go on with their work, I approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest slab of rock. It was the same fine grained</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitish rock of which the city was built, and, lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it where they had been dropped by the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutters, were several small hammers, chisels and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">adze-like tool. That they were not bronze or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">alloy of copper I knew at the first glance. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">color was that of tempered steel and they seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridiculously small for the purpose of working this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard stone. If these people used steel then I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed made a discovery, and intent on this matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">I picked up one of the tools to examine it. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner had I lifted it that I uttered an involuntary</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation of surprise. The hammer, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly larger than an ordinary tack hammer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighed fully ten pounds! It was heavier than if</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of solid gold. There was only one known</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal that could be so heavy and that was platinum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But platinum it could not be, for that metal is</seg><seg type="columnLine">softer than gold and would be of no more use for</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting rock than so much lead. The tools, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were undoubtedly hard--the polished surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer-head and the chisels, and the unscarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen edges of the latter, showed this, and, anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to test their hardness, I held a chisel against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock and struck it sharply with a hammer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more I cried out in wonder, for the chisel</seg><seg type="columnLine">had bitten fully half an inch into the stone! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cut it as easily as if the rock were cheese!</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH THE .CRATER'S RIM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">815</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What marvel was this? What magic lay in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools? And then the secret dawned upon me and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment's examination of the stone confirmed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicions. It was not that the tools were so very</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard or keen but that the rock was soft--so soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could readily cut it with my pocket knife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wax-like earthy rock which no doubt became hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon exposure to the air exactly like the coral rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bermuda, which may be quarried with saws and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even planed, but becomes as hard as limestone after</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposure to the elements. Still, the tools were far</seg><seg type="columnLine">harder than any metal except tempered steel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some time I puzzled over the matter as I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the workmen, now over their fright and adoration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">skilfully cutting and squaring the blocks of stone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was one more conundrum I could not solve, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not until long afterwards, when a careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">analysis of the metal was made, that I knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth. The metal was an alloy of platinum and</seg><seg type="columnLine">iridium--the later one of the hardest of all known</seg><seg type="columnLine">metals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we left the quarry and made our way toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city I noticed an immense aqueduct stretching</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the land from the apparently solid mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">side just above the quarry. I had given little</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought to how the people secured water here in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater. But it was now apparent that it was brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some source by the stone conduit. Keenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious to know whence it came, for I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine how a river, lake or spring could exist on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crater rim, I wished to investigate, but darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming on, I was tired and I deferred further</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploration until another day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although I suppose I should have been grateful</seg><seg type="columnLine">for being able to communicate with the people at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, yet I keenly felt the lack of a common medium</seg><seg type="columnLine">of conversation, for the sign language was limited</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I could not secure the information I so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired about many matters that puzzled me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing further of interest transpired that night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was supplied with food, I slept soundly and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not awaken until roused by the women with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast. Very soon afterwards I was summoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the throne room by Zip, as I called my companion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and once more I had to strike a match and smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pipe for the king's benefit. This time a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">personage of high rank was beside him, a villainous</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking hunchbacked dwarf with red, vicious eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cruel mouth but who, like the king, walked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. From his elaborately decorated white robes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the mitre-like crown of quetzal feathers on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray head, I concluded he was a high priest, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the designs upon his costume and the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crown, I saw a decided resemblanoe to the Aztec</seg><seg type="columnLine">priests as shown in the picturegraph of that race.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, the quetzal or resplendant trogon was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew, the sacred bird of the Aztecs and Mayas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and while I was aware that it was common in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern portions of Panama, I had never heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its occurrence in Darien, a fact which still further</seg><seg type="columnLine">confirmed my belief that these people were of Aztec</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock. But if this were the ease it was a puzzle as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to why they should be so undersized, malformed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">physically degenerate, for both the Aztecs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mayas were powerful, well-formed races. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only solution I could think of was the supposition</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that isolation and intermarriage through centuries</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought about such results.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to return to my audience with the king. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not all pleased at thus having to use my</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious matches and tobacco and I foresaw some</seg><seg type="columnLine">very unpieasant developments in store for me if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">performance was to be of daily occurrence. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifest that I must devise some new and startling</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibition of my powers if I were to retain my</seg><seg type="columnLine">prestige and my freedom, for I well knew, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">past experiences with savage races, and from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">character of these potentates, that if I failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">perform miracles, and became, in their eyes, an or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary mortal, my career would come to an abrupt</seg><seg type="columnLine">end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To be sure, there was the reassuring fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hazen would or should appear within the next forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight hours, but it was decidedly problematical as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whether I could communicate with him or could</seg><seg type="columnLine">receive any aid from the air. However, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to be done but obey and puff away at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe. With the idea of cutting the exhibition short</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stepped closer to the throne and blew the smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the faces of the king and the priest. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">monarch was soon coughing and spluttering, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was game, while the priest, to my amazement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffed the smoke and seemed to enjoy it. Here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. Evidently he had a natural taste for tobac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">co and this fact caused me a deal of worry, for if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old rascal took it into his head to acquire the</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit and demanded I should let him try a puff at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pipe I would be in a pretty fix indeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, my fears on this score were groundless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently the king, who could stand it no longer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">signalled for me to depart, which I did most gladly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I still had it in mind to investigate the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply, and with Zip--reminding me of an aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">batic down--beside me, headed for the aqueduct.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This I found was of stones, dovetailed together in</seg><seg type="columnLine">water tight joints, and built like an open trough</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the speed of the water flowing through it proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supply well above the city's level. It was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy matter to follow the conduit, for a well-trodden</seg><seg type="columnLine">path was beside it, but it was a steep up-grade climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">for nearly a mile before I gained the spot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aqueduct tapped the mountain rim. Here the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water gushed from a hole in the solid rock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its volume I knew it must come from some</seg><seg type="columnLine">large reservoir. From where I stood I could look</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly down into the quarry and the thought flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed through my mind that if the people continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to quarry in the place for many more years they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would undermine and weaken the foundations of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aqueduct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was their lookout not mine, however, and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">intent on tracing the water to its source I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a trail that appeared to lead to the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">top. In places this was excessively steep and here</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zip exhibited a new habit of his people. Dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet he proceeded to climb the path on all fours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet first and his prehensile toes grasping every</seg><seg type="columnLine">projection and bit of rock to draw him along while</seg><seg type="columnLine">his immense, powerful hands supported his weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushed him onward, He looked more like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic spider than anything, and not in the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">human. Panting and blown I at last gained the sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIfiS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mit and looked down upon a lake of dismal black</seg><seg type="columnLine">water filling a circular crater about half a mile in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter. Close by was an aperture in the rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and half-filled with water, and it was evident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was connected with the outlet below by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a shaft. Whether this was a natural formation</seg><seg type="columnLine">or had been laboriously cut by hand I could not tell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I was prepared for almost anything by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and was not greatly surprised to find a clever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly constructed sluice gate arranged above the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to regulate the flow of water. I had seen similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater lakes in the extinct volcanoes of the West</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indies, but I was surprised that Hazen had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned it. But on second thought I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that when flying over it, the dark water surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by vegetation would hardly be visible and might</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily be mistaken for heavy shadow or an empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater, while the aviator's surprise at the city would</seg><seg type="columnLine">fix his attention upon it to the exclusion of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing upon the rock ridge several hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above the city I had almost the same view as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hazen had from his plane and I could understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, at an elevation of 5000 feet or more, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been unable to obtain any very accurate idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the buildings or people. I also realized, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinking of my heart, that it would be next to im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible for him to recognize me or to see any</seg><seg type="columnLine">signals I might make.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The most prominent spot in the entire valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the pyramid, for this was isolated upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green plain and the sun, striking through a gap</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the eastern rim of the crater, shone directly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the altar's summit, thus bringing it out in sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief. Indeed, it looked for all the world like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pylon on an aviation field. If I expected to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">my presence known to Hazen or to signal to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my best point of vantage would be the summit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pyramid and I determined to climb there and</seg><seg type="columnLine">await his arrival when he should be due, two days</seg><seg type="columnLine">later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Little did I dream at the time of the conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">under which I would await him upon that gruesome</seg><seg type="columnLine">altar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Sacrifice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BY the time we had descended the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had reached the city it was noon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to my quarters I was glad to find an</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent meal. Having finished eating I threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself into the hammock and despite my scarcity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of matches and tobacco, indulged in a smoke. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling drowsy, I took off my coat, placed it on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor beside my hammock and closed my eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I awoke refreshed and reached for my coat only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leap from the hammock with a cry of alarm. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat was gone! Quickly I searched the room, think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Zip might have placed the garment elsewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I slept, but the place was bare. Zip was no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where to be seen, and even the rug on which meals</seg><seg type="columnLine">were served had been removed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was a pretty state of affairs. My coat con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained my matches, pipe, tobacco, pocket knife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief. Without it I was lost, helpless, in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of maintaining my prestige of position.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Death or worse hovered over me. My life depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">on regaining my precious garment and its contents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who could have taken it? What could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">their object? And instantly the truth flashed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mini It was that rascally high priest. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen me take pipe, tobacco and matches from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat pocket. He had watched me narrowly, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">had kept his eyes upon me through some hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">peep-hole or opening, and had seen me remove my</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat, and while I slept had seized it. Or perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had ordered Zip to secure it for him. It made</seg><seg type="columnLine">little difference which, for if it were in his posses-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion he would have me in his power. He could order</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to smoke and when I failed he could perform</seg><seg type="columnLine">the miracle himself and denounce me as an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poster. My only hope was to regain my possessions</seg><seg type="columnLine">by fair means or foul, and knowing that every sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond I delayed increased my peril, I rushed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder and across the roofs to the throne room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From beneath me, as I started to descend, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sounds of the hissing language in excited tones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as my head came below the level of the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart sank. The dark air of the room was heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with tobacco smoke!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next instant my feet were jerked from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath me, I was seized, tumbled on the floor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I could strike or rise I was bound hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot. Dazed, startled and helpless I glanced about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surrounding me were a dozen of the repulsive</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarfs. Gathered about the sides of the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">were crowds of people, and seated upon the throne,</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffing great clouds of smoke from my pipe, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wicked leer upon his ugly face, and thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoying himself, was the priest, while beside him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the king coughed and sneezed and looked very miser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this I took in at a glance. Then I was seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dragged roughly before the throne. I fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized my doom was sealed. I was no longer a</seg><seg type="columnLine">supernatural being to be feared and adored--my</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatment proved that--but merely a prisoner, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary mortal. Oddly enough, however, I was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer frightened. My first fears had given place</seg><seg type="columnLine">to anger, and I raged and fumed and prayed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grinning fiend before me might be stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all the torturing sickness, which usually fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows the beginner's first smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But apparently he was immune to the effects, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as I was dragged before the throne he rose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointing at me, addressed the crowd before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That he was denouncing me as an imposter and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time tremendously increasing his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance was evident by his tones, his gestures</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the expression on his black face. Moreover, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had another card to play. Pointing upward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving his arm and making quite creditable imita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of an airplane's exhaust, he spoke vehemently</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then pointed to a man who crouched on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dais.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first I was at a loss to grasp his meaning, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, as the trembling creature beside the throne</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in frightened tones and gesticulated vividly, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized he was the chap I had bumped into upon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival. He had spilled the beans and had informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH THE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the old scarecrow of a priest that I had arrived via</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel and not from the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt sure now that my doom was sealed. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing I could do or say. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one chance in a million that I might be escorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the valley and turned loose in the tunnel; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gave me no comfort, for I knew that hideous</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain death awaited me on that slope covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devilish man-eating-trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chances, however, were, all in favor of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">being tortured and butchered. Strangely enough my</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest regret, the matter which troubled me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most and made me curse my carelessness in remov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my coat while I slept, was not that I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be killed--I had faced death too often for that--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that I would be unable to report the wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful discoveries I had made or give my knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city and its people to the world. Indeed, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts were so concentrated on this that I gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">little attention to the priest, until he stepped for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and, with a nasty grimace, struck me savage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly across the face. Maddened at the blow I lunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward like a butting ram. My head struck square-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly in the pit of his stomach, and with a gasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell he doubled up and fell sprawling on the dais</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the pipe flew from his lips and scattered its</seg><seg type="columnLine">contents far and near. Before I could roll to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, my'guards seized and pulled me across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Despite my plight and the fate in store</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me I laughed loudly and heartily as I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest with hands pressed to stomach, eyes rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly and a sickly greenish pallor on his face. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow plus the tobacco had done its work. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">evened up the score a bit at any rate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next moment I was hauled through a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway hidden by 'draperies, and, bumping like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bag of meal over the rough stones, was pitched in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an inky black cell,- Bruised, scratched and1</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding I lay there unable to move or see while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the occasional sounds of shuffling footsteps, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather handsteps, told me a guard was close at hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For hour after hour I lay motionless, expecting each</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute that I would be dragged out to torture or</seg><seg type="columnLine">death and wondering dully what form it would take,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until at last--numb, exhausted and worn out, I lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was brought to my senses by being seized and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked to a sitting posture, and found the cell il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminated by a spluttering torch, while two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men supported my shoulders and a third held a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gourd of water to my lips. My throat was parched</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the liquid was most welcome, and a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, a fourth man appeared with food. It was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that the priest had no intention of letting me</seg><seg type="columnLine">die of thirst or starvation, and I wondered why he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be so solicitous of my comfort if I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed to an early death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as I had eaten, the guards withdrew, tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the torch, and I was once more left in stygian</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness with my thoughts. I wondered whether it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were day or night, but I had no means of judging.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been the middle of the afternoon when I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed my coat, and, reasoning that the food served</seg><seg type="columnLine">was probably the evening meal, I decided that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now about sundown. In that case I should probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">be put out of the way the next morning. That</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CRATER'S RIM	817</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a full twenty-four hours before Hazen</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due and I wondered what he would think when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw no sign of me in the valley--whether he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would surmise that I had not reached the city and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been killed by the Kunas, and what he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">report to my friends in Colon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Colon, friends and Hazen seemed very far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away as I thought of them there in that black hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting death at the hands of the strange black</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarfs and, as far as any aid they could give me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was concerned I might as well have been in Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My thoughts were interrupted by my guards reap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearing with the torch. Lifting me to my feet they</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosened the bonds about my legs and urged me</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a small doorway, where I was compelled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend low to pass, and along a winding, narrow, low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceilinged stone tunnel. That I was on my way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my execution I was sure, and vague thoughts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">selling my life dearly and of overpowering my</seg><seg type="columnLine">puny guards crossed my mind. But I dismissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">such ideas as useless, for even were I to succeed I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no better off. There were thousands of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny men in the city, it was impossible to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the valley unseen, and I had not the least idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the underground passage led. To attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape meant certain death, and there still remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint chance, a dim hope that I might yet be</seg><seg type="columnLine">spared and merely deported. So, ducking my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with stooping shoulders, I picked ray way along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel by the fitful glare of the flaming torch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For what seemed miles the way led on and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to think that the entrance was outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley and that I was being led to freedom, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glimmer of light showed ahead, the floor sloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward, and, an instant later, I emerged in the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment my eyes were blinded by the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the darkness of the passage and I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp where I was. I had thought it evening, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">my first glance told me it was early morning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew the night had passed and another day had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. Then, as I looked about at my surroundings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it dawned upon me where I was, a shudder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror, a chill of deadly fear swept over me. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the summit of the pyramid. The sacrificial altar</seg><seg type="columnLine">was within three paces. Beside it stood the fiendish</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest and his assistants, and gathered upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green plain were hordes of people with faces up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned towards me. I was about to be sacrificed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be bound fast to the bloodstained awful stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have my still-beating heart torn from my living</seg><seg type="columnLine">body!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anything were preferable to that and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden bound I strove to gain the altar's edge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurl myself to certain death. But to no avail. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dwarfs held me fast by the cord which fast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened my wrists and I was jerked back to fall heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the stones. Before I could struggle up, four</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the priest's assistants sprang forward and, grasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me by legs and shoulders, lifted me and tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me upon the stinking sacrificial stone. I was help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, and instantly my ankles were tied fast to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal staples, the bonds of my wrists were severed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arms were drawn apart and securely lashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">other staples, the stone collar was placed about my</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck forcing my head far back and I was ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">818</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for the glowering priest to wreak his awful venge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Stepping close to the altar he drew a glittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsidian knife--and even in my terrible predica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment I noted this, and realized that he was adhering</seg><seg type="columnLine">strictly to Aztec customs--and, raising his arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began a wailing, blood-curdling chant. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the thousands of throats below came the chant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing chorus, rising and falling like a great wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sound. How long I wondered, would this keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">on? How much longer must this agony, this tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of suspense be borne? Why did he not strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stone dagger into my chest and have it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">with?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, from some dormant cell in my brain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the answer. I was to be sacrificed to the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">god, and I remembered that, according to the Aztec</seg><seg type="columnLine">religion, the blow could not be struck until the ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sun cast its rays upon the victim's chest above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart. The priest was awaiting that moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was delaying until the sun, still behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater's rim, should throw its first rays upon me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long would it be? How many minutes must</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass before the fatal finger of light pointed to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart? With a mighty effort I turned my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly towards the east. Above the rugged moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain edge was a blaze of light. Even as I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with aching eyes a golden beam shot across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley and flashed blindingly into my face. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now only a matter of seconds. The priest raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife aloft. The chant from the multitude ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over city and valley fell an ominous, awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. Upon the sacrificial knife the sun gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliantly, transforming the glass-like stoae to</seg><seg type="columnLine">burnished gold. With his free hand the priest tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">open my shirt and bared my bosom. I felt that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end had come. I closed my eyes. And then, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very instant when the knife was about to sweep</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, faint and far away, like the humming of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant bee, I caught a sound. It was unmistakable</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike anything else in all the world--the exhaust</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an airplane's engines!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And my straining ears were not the only ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">that heard that note. Over the priest's faee swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look of deadly fear. The poised knife was slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered. He turned trembling towards the west</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from the waiting throng below rose a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh of terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A new hope sprang up in my breast. Was it</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hazen? He was not due until the next day and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be only some army plane that would pass far</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one side of the valley. No, the sound was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing, the plane was approaching. But even</seg><seg type="columnLine">were it Hazen would it help me any? Would he see</seg><seg type="columnLine">my plight and descend or would he fly too far above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city to note what was taking place? For a space</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life was saved. The fear of that giant, roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird would prevent the sacrifice. The priest feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">' he had made a mistake, that I urns a god, that, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky, vengeance would swoop upon him and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">people for the contemplated butchery. But if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane passed? Or would his dread of it be greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than his fear of defying the sun god by failing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sacrifice?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now the roar of the motor Bounded direetly over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and the next moment I glimpsed the plane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding across the blue morning sky. Then it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. The exhaust grew fainter and fainter. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope was lost. Whoever it was had flown on, all un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspecting the awful fate of a fellow man upon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlit pyramid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now the priest was again towering over me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once more he raised his knife. I could feel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm sun beating upon my throat and shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could feel it creeping slowly but surely down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. The knife quivered in the impatient hand of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the priest, I saw his muscles tense themselves for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blow, I caught the grim smile that flitted across</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face as he prepared to strike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An instant more and my palpitating heart would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be held aloft for all to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the blow never fell. With a deafening roar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that drowned the mighty shout of terror from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, the airplane swooped like an eagle from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky and clove the air within a hundred feet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">altar. With a gurgling cry the priest flung himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">face down, and his knife fell clattering with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of broken glass upon the stones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Was it Hazen? Would he see me? Would he</seg><seg type="columnLine">alight? Was I saved?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The answer was a thunderous, fear maddened cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">from below, a swishing whirr as of a gale of wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a dark shadow sweeping over me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then my overwrought senses, my frazzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves could stand no more and all went black be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore my eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dimly consciousness came back. I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds of rushing feet, the panting labored breaths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men, sharp, half uttered exclamations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunting noises. Then a shrill scream of mortal</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror and a deep drawn sigh of relief. Above my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering eyes a figure suddenly loomed. A weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncanny figure with strangely smooth and rounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and great goggling, glassy eyes. With a jerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone collar was lifted from my strained neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as full consciousness came back I gasped. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Hazen! By some miracle he was ahead of time!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From somewhere, muffled behind that grotesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask, came a hoarse: "My God, are you hurt?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before I could speak the bonds were slashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my ankles and wrists. A strong arm raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and pulled me from the slab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For God's sake, hurry!" cried Hazen, as half</seg><seg type="columnLine">supporting me he rushed toward the altar stairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've got 'em buffaloed for a minute, but the Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone knows how long it'll hold 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rapidly as my numbed limbs would permit I</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed down the sloping, spiral way. Half carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Hazen I raced across the few yards of grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the base of the pyramid and the plane, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I did so I caught a fleeting glimpse of a hud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled, shapeless, bloodly bundle of green and white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all that remained of the priest whom Hazen</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hurled from the altar top!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next moment I was in the plane and Hazen</seg><seg type="columnLine">was twirling the propeller. There was a roar as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motor started. Hazen leaped like an acrobat</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his seat and slowly the machine moved across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everywhere the people we«e prostrate, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine started forward one after another</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up. Ere we had traveled a score of yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH THE CRATER'S RIM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">819</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the creatures were rising and with frightful screams</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scattering from our pathway. It was impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to avoid them. With sickening shocks the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirring propeller struck one after another. Blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">spattered our faces and becrimsoned the windshield</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the wings. But uninjured the plane gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">headway; the uneven bumping over the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased; we were traveling smoothly, lifting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then with a strange wild roar the people rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us. Racing on their hands they came. Rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and missiles whizzed about us. An arrow whirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">by my head and struck quivering in a strut. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now we were rising rapidly. We were looking down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the maddened hosts, their arrows and sling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung stones were striking the under surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuselage and wings. We were safe at last. A mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment more and we would be above the crater rim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden exclamation from Hazen startled me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I glanced up. Straight ahead rose the precipitous</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain side above the quarry. To clear it we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must ascend far more rapidly than we were doing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must have splintered the blades!" jerked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hazen. "She's not making it. Can't swing her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rudder's jammed. Heave out everything you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">find. Hurry or we'll smash!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before us loomed the ragged, rocky wall. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rushing to our doom at lightning speed. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hazen's words I grasped whatever I could find and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed it over the side. A box of provisions, a roll</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tools, a leather jacket, a thermos bottle, canteens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an automatic pistol and a cartridge belt all went.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I glanced up. We were rising faster. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds more overboard, a few feet higher and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be clear. Was there anything else I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw out? Frantically I searched. I saw a can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like object resting on a frame. Spare gasoline I</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided, but fuel was of no value now. With an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort I dragged it out. I lifted it and hurled it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sudden jerk the plane sprung upward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a terrific muffled roar from below and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with barely a yard to spare we rose above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater rim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord, you must have dropped that old bomb!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried Hazen. "The concussion jarred the rudder</seg><seg type="columnLine">free."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I glanced over the side. Far beneath, a cloud of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smoke and dust was drifting slowly aside exposing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the aqueduct, broken, smashed and in ruins. FroM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the opening in the mountain side a mighty stream</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of water was roaring in a rushing, tearing torrent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The bomb had landed squarely in the quarry. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aqueduct had fallen, the shock had let loose the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gates of the lake and the whole vast crater re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">servoir was pouring in a mighty flood across the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In a wide arc Hazen swung the plane about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Poor devils!" he muttered as we soared above the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">doomed city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Already the green plain was shimmering with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the glint of water. We could see the frantic, fren-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">zied people running and scrambling up their lad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ders. Again we wheeled and circled far above them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and now only the roof tops of the houses were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">above the flood. Presently these too sank from sight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and above the sunlit waters only the sacrificial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stone remained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It's all over!" exclaimed Hazen, and heading</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">northward we sped beyond the encircling mountain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Beneath us now was forest, and with a shudder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I recognized it as that death-dealing, nightmare</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grove of cannibal trees. Fascinated I gazed down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and suddenly from the mountain side behind us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">burst a frothing yellow torrent. The pressure of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the flood had been too great. The overwhelming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waters had forced the stone door of the tunnel by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which I had entered that incredible valley. Before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my wondering eyes the devastating deluge swept</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down the slope. I saw the monstrous trees shiver</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and sway and crash before the irresistible force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They gave way and like matchsticks went tossing,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tumbling, bobbing down the hillside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Higher and higher we rose. The water-filled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crater was now but a silvery lake. The slope up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which I had fought and raced from the ravenous,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blood-sucking trees was bare, red earth scarred</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deep by the plunging stream that flowed over it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Far to the west gleamed the blue Pacific. Like a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vast map Darien was spread below us. Northward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we sped. Before us was civilization. Behind us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">death and destruction. The man-eating trees were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a thing of the past.

The first was the sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrast between his refined manners</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his shabby outfit, which made me</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspect he was not an ordinary prospec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor any more than I, although he surely seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel more comfortable in those clothes and in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a place. It entered my mind that his disguise had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same purpose as mine--and that we were both</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged in the same adventure. Such a possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">both amused and irritated me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I watched him swinging from one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle to the other, as his horse, just ahead of mine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously went down the dangerous slope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His second peculiarity was the sack bound to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. This sack was small but heavy, as I judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the effort he displayed, now and then, in ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranging it on his shoulders. What puzzled me was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that he carried this burden on his back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he could easily have tied it to the saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His third peculiarity, which had been first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike me, was his remarkably long upper lip.

The moon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and its glow.inundated the plain, transforming</seg><seg type="columnLine">it into an ocean of dead calmness. Wells pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the north. A tower as slim as the steeple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a Gothic Church rose against the sky to a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">height.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During my journalistic career, I have had to cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">many exciting stories, filled with pathos or danger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But never have I been so thrilled as when I stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">my horse, for a minute, to gaze at that shadowy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower. I felt sure that I was going to witness a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodigious achievement, which, for its arduousness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its gigantic possibilities and its sublimity, had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal in the history of the world. I exulted over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opportunity that was so soon to be mine--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet the man who, by the power of his genius, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to transform the earth almost like a God.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we came nearer, I 'distinguished other con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structions besides the tower. There were five or</seg><seg type="columnLine">six houses of different shapes and dimensions. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them was lighted. Toward that one Wells went.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I examined the tower as carefully as I could in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanty light of the moon. It was a skeleton tower</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steel bars, built on a massive concrete base that</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered a surface about four hundred feet square.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tapering, as the height increased, it ended almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a point, supporting a large sphere, which by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way it reflected the rays of the moon, appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of glass. Innumerable wire cables, parting</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tower at regular intervals and fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground, insured the stability of the construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, which I judged to be fully five hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some workl" I exclaimed in admiration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, when you think that they built thirty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these spikes in the valley.

He had the ordinary appearance of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle aged man, with a calm and cheerful face, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had never been troubled by any problem. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had not been five minutes in the room before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that I was in the presence of an extraordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wells made his introduction as planned, mention-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me as his partner. Then without delay he put</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hands of the Professor two of the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">gems of his collection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile I looked around the spacious room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">illuminated by two electric lights. The confusion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the multitude, and the variety of the objects scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered about made of that place a strange combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of library, draughting room, work-shop, mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seum, laboratory and storehouse. A wooden parti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion separated the room from the other part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building, accessible through a large doorway which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wide open. Desirous of finding out what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next room contained, I gradually reached the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and looked inside. The place was dark, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight, entering through the open window, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed me to see that the floor was covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes, all of one dimension three feet long by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet wide, placed six inches apart, and each con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected to the next by wires. The boxes were placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in parallel rows, with room enough for a person to</seg><seg type="columnLine">step between the rows. I figured that there must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be fully forty boxes in each row--in all more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thousand boxes. I could not see anything else</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that vast room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Examining the Rubies--Explanations of the Project</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MY conjectures did not lead me to any plausible</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation of the nature of what I was seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I turned to the two men, who were still talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the precious stones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor was holding one against the bulb</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the electric light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">824</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These are star rubies," he said with profound</seg><seg type="columnLine">conviction.

The look that Wells sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">me clearly indicated that I was guilty of a serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">imprudence. But the Professor turned his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those are the batteries, the electric batteries</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will furnish the current to the thirty towers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And instead of proceeding toward the door, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked back to the partition, turned a switch, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">illuminated the second room. I noticed then some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I had not seen before. That room, besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rows of boxes, contained a very large bench to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the wires of the batteries ran, and which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of electrometers and two very conspicuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">switches. I noticed also (and this detail had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most important bearing on the events that succeeded)</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the bench ran along the wall, directly under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Over there you shift the electric current?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right," answered the Professor. And he smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">again at my curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hundred questions crowded my mind at once;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Wells came to my rescue. Seeing that the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor was unusually communicative, he thought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time was at hand to try the effect of the story he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had concocted for my benefit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Professor," he began, endeavoring to make his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice sound indifferent. "I wish you would tell my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend something about your work. I explained it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all to him, but I must have done a poor job, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he couldn't make head or tail of my account. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can go into details, because he has some education.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went to college before the mining bug got him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Am I right, Pal?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I answered with a nod. I was so anxious about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor's reaction that I could not utter a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> .Wells noticed my confusion. To save the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion he added:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Project Is Explained by the Inventor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">«/^VF course, there is one thing he has understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">W --that you are the greatest genius of this and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any other generation, and that your invention is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the most astonishing thing-."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, now," interrupted the Professor, laughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the earnestness of Wells' enthusiasm. "Let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">not exaggerate. I have found nothing new; I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">only applied old and well known discoveries to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical and useful purpose." Then, addressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to me, "Young man, do you know much</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Roentgen rays?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Did I know! Before starting on my adventure, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone through all the books that could enlighten</seg><seg type="columnLine">me on the subject of Professor Matheson's inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. But I answered hesitatingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I remember they are produced by an elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical discharge passed through a tube from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air has been exhausted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly! Now, I have found a new application</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these rays. I have found a practical way of elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifying the air of a vast area with a single tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">which does not differ much from the one introduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Porter. There is nothing essentially new in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Professor, you are too modest," interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am telling you the truth, and I can prove it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come over here, and I will show you something."</seg><seg type="columnLine">We returned to the front room. The Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed our attention to two spherical glasses, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about six Inches in diameter and four feet apart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted on pedestals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These are the miniatures of the apparatus that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have placed in the towers--nothing but a Porter</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube, with one or two changes. As you can see, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cathode is the same: a segment of a hollow sphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The anti-cathode is also connected with the anode;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but instead of platinum or tantalum I use a compo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition of my invention which is not affected by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme heat of the discharge. The tube, instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being exhausted as usual, contains a gaseous sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, about which I keep silent. And the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">induction coil, with a mercery interrupter, produces</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discharge. The usual ionization of a gas is due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the splitting up of 'some' of the atoms of that gas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resulting in the detachment of electrons, constituents</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the atoms. Each electron carries a constant nega-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive charge, while the part of the atom that is left</seg><seg type="columnLine">behaves like a positive ion, with the units charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">positively, but with a mass that is large compared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that of the negative ions. Do you follow me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Tes," I answered, while Wells stared at me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out if I meant it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps my "yes" was not as convincing as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have been.

"But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can tell you now, in one word, what my application</seg><seg type="columnLine">is. One of these tubes ionizes the surrounding air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the positive nuclei are attracted by the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube which ionizes the air, not with a smaller but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a larger proportion of negative electrons. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is absolutely all."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LORD OF THE WINDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">825</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor stopped as if he had finished. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at him in suspense, and Wells kept staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Professor and at me with evident confusion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At length Wells spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what about the winds ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Here, place your hand here," said the inventor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding the hand of the miner at the level of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roentgen tubes, and midway between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor turned a switch on the table. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish glare appeared in both tubes, sparkling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing, while the crisp, short discharges sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in rapid succession.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to try their maximum efficiency.

I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never before seen a like expression of stupor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismay. He held his head with both hands--then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if struck by a sudden idea, he made for the open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I caught him by his coat, and pulled him back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is folly to go out," I yelled; but I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear my own voice, as the wind, increasing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence, had increased its roaring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor, turning quickly, struck me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful blow in the chest, then freeing his coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my grip, leaped toward the stone house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Inventor Perishes in the Wind of His Creation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT I had expected happened. The ill-fated</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had scarcely taken ten steps, when, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of protection of the shielding cabin, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized by the wind and thrown to the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There he struggled frantically, while the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled, knocked and tossed him. A little farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">on I saw him stop: perhaps he had succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting hold of some rock protruding from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. I saw him rising again, and then, (the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so bright that I could distinguish everything)'</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was lifted bodily from the ground, as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LORD OF THE WINDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">827</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a rag, and blown along with such vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence that his body struck the wall of the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">house with a terrific impact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I closed my eyes in horror. But presently I real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized the danger that I too was facing. The cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to be smashed; the boards were coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart. Evidently Wells shared my fears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What were we to do?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I quickly analyzed the situation. If the towers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in action, the electric power of the storage</seg><seg type="columnLine">batteries must have been turned on by something</seg><seg type="columnLine">or somebody. The breaking of the current would</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop that cyclone and save us from destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But how could we reach the stone house to open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the switches when a sally from the cabin meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure death?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if he had read that fearful question in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, Wells answered it in an unexpected way. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed a rope lying in a corner, and showed it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. To talk was useless; so he acted. First he</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted the rope by arm lengths. I counted at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time, and figured out that there were fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">75 yards of strong rope, more than the distance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin to the stone house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then with gestures, Wells asked me to tie one</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the rope around his body, under his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, as he could not do it himself, because of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">inseparable sack of precious gems. To the knots I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made, Wells added one more, then took the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the rope, passed it around one of the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">supporting posts of the hut, pulled until all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope had passed through, and handed it to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His plan was clear. Securely tied he would ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture outside, and I would let the rope slide easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he could reach the stone house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lay on the ground, face down, and moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a turtle, began his perilous journey. I seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself on the floor, my back to the door, my feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the boards of the wall, my hands holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Ray of Hope But No More</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS unexpected chance of salvation gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">such joy that I heard no more of the rushing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hurricane, nor the cracking of the cabin: all</seg><seg type="columnLine">my attention was concentrated on my task of let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting the rope slide out inch by inch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of a sudden there was a tremendous crash, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found myself lying on my back with the moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light shining in my face. The cabin had gone; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope had slipped out of my hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I recovered from my stupor, I wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">at two things--why I had not been hurt when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin went to pieces and why I was still in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same place, not the prey of the devastating wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I explained the first by a mere miracle--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second by looking in the direction of my feet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, blown up in great quantity by the wind, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered against the back of the cabin; and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the cabin was gone, this sand formed a dune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine feet long and two feet high, which shielded me</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the full force of the hurricane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I decided to take a still safer position. Crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my back, I placed myself lengthwise close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dune. Now I could see the tower and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone house; but of the half dozen huts I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a sign.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was by no means at ease; the shelter was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable, and not fully reassuring, but I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do nothing except wait for that inferno to come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'The batteries will become exhausted sooner or</seg><seg type="columnLine">later," I said to myself, "but when? In an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a day, or in a week?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With horror, I soon discovered the presence of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">more imminent danger. I should say two dangers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one as deadly as the other. I discovez-ed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of the little hill of sand was gradually be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming lower, and that the time was not far off</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it would become so low that the wind could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get its mighty grip on my body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I discovered also that the sand carried in large</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds by the tornado was accumulating in the hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low where I lay, and threatened to cover me. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, I was greatly frightened, yet my mind wa3</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, and, strange, as it may sound, I immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to calculate which of the two deaths would</seg><seg type="columnLine">get me first--to be buried alive in the sand, or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be caught by the wind and smashed against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of the stone house. I even tried to speculate</seg><seg type="columnLine">which of the two was less terrible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hurricane now held full sway. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the whole earth was trembling. The roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shrilling and shrieking lacerated my ears. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like the thundering of a hundred tempests over</seg><seg type="columnLine">an infuriated ocean, or the crashing of a cataract</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand times larger than Niagara.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now and then, I even seemed to distinguish some</seg><seg type="columnLine">special sounds in that unbelievable noise. Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was the discordant dissonance of a million</seg><seg type="columnLine">violins and 'cellos played in seven different keys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and accompanied by a gigantic organ with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes wide open. And then it sounded like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moaning of infinite herds caught in a forest fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the screams and groans of distress of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobs of the world threatened by unavoidable de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Wind Bridled and Wreaking Destruction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT above all this, I heard the enraged voices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind--of the wind that, free since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of creation, free to roam over the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mensities of the seas, free to dominate over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild forests, free to speed over the boundless</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserts and over the mountain peaks, free to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go in the infinite vastness of the earth, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling now for the first time the touch of the bridle</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly imposed by the genius of man, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate convulsions was in vain rebelling against</seg><seg type="columnLine">that conquering power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My God! its revolt was horrible beyond words!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was passing above my head? I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be mistaken; those were bodies of men, of horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cattle, some tumbling to the ground and rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">up again in clouds of sand, then fast disappearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strange as it may seem, even in the agitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all my nerves, the magnitude and horror of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene brought some verses to my memory.

Dr. Spaulding leaped upon the machine, gibbering incoherently, and smashed the mechanism Into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand pieces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TELEPATHIC PICK-UP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">829</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HERE was a strange light in Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spaulding's eyes. His face was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobile, but the lines were set in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression of jubilance and triumph.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come on, Brant," he said quietly, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have something interesting to show you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that remark, he wheeled, and strode into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gloom of the hall. I followed, and our footsteps</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoed with hollowness in that spacious, blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had always felt a certain timidity when with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Spaulding. We had been friends for years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet strangers. His was a personality which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seemingly been fashioned for dominance over</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I had never been able, in our long acquaint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, to raise my head squarely, and hold the gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his eyes. My fount of conversation dried up</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the queer influence of him, and I was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served and stumbling in my speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I admired, with no malice, his genius--his ec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centric and versatile genius that had placed him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head of his profession, had made him an emin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent scientist, and had allowed him to conquer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleld of electricity. He had performed, during his</seg><seg type="columnLine">career, many marvelous feats of surgery, had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">important advances in both astronomy and chem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istry, and had given countless electrical inventions</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world. Of late years, he had devoted himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely to electrical research.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had seen him but once in the last year and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half. At that meeting he had hinted to me that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at work on a radio apparatus that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">startle the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't be called radio though, Brant," he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me with a dry, rasping chuckle. "It shall have</seg><seg type="columnLine">another name. When it is finished, I shall explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all first to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So when I received his phone call I concluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had completed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning with curiosity as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I followed him down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned into the liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing room. That chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no darker, no emptier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no more gloomy</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any other room in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his house, but I loathed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">even more than the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For always as I entered,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 was brought face to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a portrait of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor's brother, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy was forcibly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to me. It had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">many years ago, but time had not dulled it in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend's mind, nor my own. I could well remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber that night, and Tom Spaulding's flight, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump ahead of the law, because he was wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for embezzlement of fifty thousand dollars. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgrace of it had crushed the doctor, and because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was his beloved brother, the blow was even</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater. It had aged and changed him, and sent him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the life of a recluse. That it was responsible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his many invaluable discoveries was probable, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not any less regrettable, at least to me. As for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Spaulding, we had not heard of him since</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that night, but perhaps that was just as well, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">we learned later that he had sunk to the lowest</seg><seg type="columnLine">level of the underworld.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gave the picture as fleeting a glance as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, but the doctor stood for a long while gazing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it. He seemed lost in revery. At last he recov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered himself with a start, motioned me to a chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned to the huge mahogany table. He bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a large, box-like cabinet of dark wood, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet unlike the ordinary radio set. He tinkered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few minutes with the knobs and dials. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he faced me again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the invention," he said. "Remember, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last time I saw you I told you I was working on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">super-radio? This is it, a telepathy radio.

I won't bore you with any explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the inner workings of the machine. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough that I went to the radio and the seismo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph to produce it. I called you so that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">give you a demonstration, as I promised. You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first person to whom I have shown it.

That is what I am going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to do tonight. If he lives, his mind will speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">through this loud speaker. You understand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio. Well, this machine is similar. It must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuned into the thought-wave length of the man you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to reach.

"Oh, I answer techni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal questions for them occasionally.

The Chief entered the corridor, steered</seg><seg type="columnLine">us into an elevator and we were whisked aloft. "Six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teenth floor," grunted the Chief to the operator, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stepped out into the corridor on that story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following Chief Davidson, we came to a suite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of offices, the frosted glass on the door bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the legend, "Corey &amp; Co., General Offices." "Phew!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped Fenner. "Who was it? Not-?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Davidson paused with his hand on the knob. "Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was. Old John Corey and you can guess the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion this'll make,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He flung open the door, and we filed in. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">policeman on guard touched his cap in salute to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his superior. We were in an outer office. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">desks were arranged around the room, and at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them three girls huddled in a scared little group.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One was sobbing softly. I noticed a man with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back toward us, looking out the window into space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paying no attention to the occupants of this room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davidson strode across to a door marked "John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corey, Private." Opening it, he paused on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threshold. Fenner and 1 crowded at his back. Over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder I could see into the inner office. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, clad in a grey suit, was on the floor on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and knees. He looked up quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come ahead," he said to the Chief, "you can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoil any marks. There's nothing to spoil."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seated at a desk in the center of the room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man. His head rested on the flat top of the desk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms flung forward before him. Davidson</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded toward him. "Just as he was found," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, simply. It was my first sight of violent death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horror, or some other violent emotion, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart throb jerkily, I moved forward with Fen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, and looked down at the corpse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A glance at the bowed back told the tale. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat was soaked with blood, which had welled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gaping wound below the left shoulder blade. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">never tell you why I didn't faint. I wanted to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fenner turned to the man in grey. "What have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you learned, Frank?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frank, who was evidently a detective, shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head gloomily. "Nothing," he replied, "except what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see. He's been stabbed, that's evident, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whoever did it took the weapon away with him. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he got in here, and how he got out, God alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows. I've been over this floor on my hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees with a microscope. There's not a mark. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot print in the dust, except those made by Corey</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Nothing. Not a finger print on the walls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the desk, on the body, on the floor, on the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">knob--inside or out--not anywhere. It's beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Couldn't come in through the outer office, eh?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fenner's eyes were roving over the room. Frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head slowly in negation. "Three girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the head bookkeeper out there all evening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">working overtime. All swear not one of them has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in this room this evening. Corey came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the outer office--the only way he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">come In, for this office has only the one entrance--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed the door. About half past eight one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girls opened the door to come in. She saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">something had happened to Corey, and she didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross the threshold. All of them had sense enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay out. They telephoned for us. I was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first man in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No other doors?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nope. Only one way in. Through that office."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fenner was gazing at the wall on the street side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did you open that window?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. It was open. But it might as well have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been bricked up for all the good it's going to do us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corey opened it himself, no doubt. It's just sixteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories to the street, and you can bet no one climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to it. It's five stories to the roof. One chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one thousand that any one climbed down. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take nerves of steel to drop over the edge on</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE EDUCATED HARPOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">833</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a rope, and if some one did have the nerve, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't have gotten in by that window noiselessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough not to warn Corey. And just assuming</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he did, he'd surely leave a mark doing it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fenner nodded. "He certainly would," he ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiesced. "How about the people in the office out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there? Are they all above suspicion?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All above it," complained Frank, "and not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, but the very number of them lets them out</seg><seg type="columnLine">without question. It's not reasonable to suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">that three girls and a man, all trusted employees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would conspire to kill their employer without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive for doing so. One of them might try it, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe even two, but it's hardly likely that all four</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be against the man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right you are," admitted Fenner, "I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way myself, but we have to eliminate the pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility of an inside job first. Well, Chief, I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that I can do you any good in this matter. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is unusual enough to be interesting, and if you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind I'll drop in and have a look around in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help yourself," gloomed Davidson.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">very primitive apparatus, magnifying some fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameters, presented, it is true, only indistinct and</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperfect forms, but still sufficiently wonderful to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work up my imagination to a preternatural state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing me so interested in this rude instrument,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my cousin explained to me all that he knew about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the principles of the microscope, related to me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few of the wonders which had been accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">through its agency, and ended by promising to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">me one regularly constructed, immediately on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to the city. I counted the days, the hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minutes, that intervened between that promise</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his departure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime I was not idle. Every transparent sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance that bore the remotest resemblance to a lens</seg><seg type="columnLine">I eagerly seized upon, and employed in vain at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempts to realize that instrument, the theory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose construction I as yet only vaguely compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hended.

I even went so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to extract the crystalline humor from the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fishes and animals, and endeavored to press it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the microscopic service. I plead guilty to having</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen the glasses from my Aunt Agatha's spectacles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a dim idea of grinding them into lenses of won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drous magnifying pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perties,--in which at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt it is scarcely neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to say that I totally</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Real Microscope at Last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T last the promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument came.

As far as educa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional purposes went, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">better apparatus could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have been selected. Accompanying it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small treatise on the microscope,--its history,</seg><seg type="columnLine">uses, and discoveries. I comprehended then</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time the "Arabian Nights Enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainments." The dull veil of ordinary existence that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung'across the world seemed suddenly to roll away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to lay bare a land of enchantments. I felt to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards my companions as the seer might feel to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the ordinary masses of men. I held con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versations with nature in a tongue which they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand. I was in daily communication with</seg><seg type="columnLine">living wonders, such as they never imagined in their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wildest visions. I penetrated beyond the external</seg><seg type="columnLine">portal of things, and roamed through the sanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuaries. Where they beheld only a drop of rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly rolling down the window-glass, I saw a uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse of beings animated with all the passions com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon to physical life, and convulsing their minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere with struggles as fierce and protracted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of men. In the common spots of mould,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which my mother, good housekeeper that she was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely scooped away from her jam pots, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">abode for me, under the name of mildew, enchanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardens, filled with dells and avenues of the densest</seg><seg type="columnLine">foliage and most astonishing verdure, while from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fantastic boughs of these microscopic forests</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung strange fruits glittering with green, and sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver, and gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was no scientific thirst that at this time filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind.

Alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my microscope, I dimmed my sight, day after</seg><seg type="columnLine">day and night after night, poring over the marvels</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it unfolded to me. I was like one who, hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing discovered the ancient Eden still existing in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">its primitive glory, should resolve to enjoy it in soli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude, and never betray to mortal the secret of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">locality. The rod of my life was bent at this mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.

In every fresh specimen of cryptogamia</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I placed beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">my instrument I believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I discovered wonders</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which the world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as yet ignorant. I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member well the thrill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight and admiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shot through me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time that I dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel animalcule (Roti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fera vulgaris) expanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">and contracting its flex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible spokes, and seemingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotating through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Alas! as I grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">older, and obtained some works treating of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorite study, I found that I was only on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threshhold of a science to the investigation of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the greatest men of the age were devoting</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lives and intellects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I grew up, my parents, who saw but little</seg><seg type="columnLine">likelihood of anything practical resulting from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">examination of bits of moss and drops of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a brass tube and a piece of glass, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious that I should choose a profession.

This disposition of my future suited</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. A removal from my relatives would enable</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to dispose of my time as I pleased without fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of detection. As long as I paid my Academy fees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might shirk attending the lectures if I chose; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I never had the remotest intention of standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">an examination, there was no danger of my being</seg><seg type="columnLine">"plucked." Besides, a metropolis was the place for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. There I could obtain excellent instruments, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newest publications, intimacy with men of pursuits</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindred with my own,--in short, all things neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to insure a profitable devotion of my life to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my beloved science. I had an abundance of money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">few desires that were not bounded by my illumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nating mirror on one side and my object-glass on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other; what, therefore, was to prevent my be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming an illustrious investigator of the veiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds? It was with the most buoyant hope that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">left my New England home and established my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Longing of a Man of Science</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MY first step, of course, was to find suitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartments. These I obtained, after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of days' search, in Fourth Avenue;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very pretty second-floor unfurnished, containing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting-room, bed-room, and a smaller apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I intended to fit up as a laboratory. I fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished my lodgings simply, but rather elegantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then devoted all my energies to the adornment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the temple of my worship. I visited Pike, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">celebrated optician, and passed in review his</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid collection of microscopes,--Field's Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound, Hingham's, Spencer's, Nachet's Binocular</seg><seg type="columnLine">(that founded on the principles of the stereoscope),</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at length fixed upon that form known as Spen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cer's Trunnion Microscope, as combining the great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est number of improvements with an almost perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom from tremor. Along with this I pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chased every possible accessory,--draw-tubes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">micrometers, a camerarlucida, lever-stage, achro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic condensers, white cloud illuminators, prisms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">parabolic condensers, polarizing apparatus, forceps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aquatic boxes, fishing-tubes, with a host of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">articles, all of which would have been useful in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of an experienced microscopist, but, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterwards discovered, were not of the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">present value to me. It takes years of practice to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how to use a complicated microscope. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">optician looked suspiciously at me as I made these</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholesale purchases. He evidently was uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether to set me down as some scientific celebrity</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a madman. I think, he inclined to the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief. I suppose I was mad. Every great genius</seg><seg type="columnLine">is mad upon the subject in which he is greatest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The unsuccessful madman is disgraced and called a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunatic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">At Last Some Real Discoveries Aro Madie</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAD or not, I set myself to work with a zeal</seg><seg type="columnLine">which few scientific students have ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">equalled. I had everything to learn relative to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate study upon which I had embarked,--a study</seg><seg type="columnLine">involving the most earnest patience, the most rigid</seg><seg type="columnLine">analytic powers, the steadiest hand, the most un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiring eye, the most refined and subtile manipula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.	i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time half my apparatus lay inactively</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the shelves of my laboratory, which was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">most amply furnished with every possible con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trivance for facilitating my investigations. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact was that I did not know how to use some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my scientific implements,--never having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught microscopics,--and those whose use I un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood theoretically were of little avail, until by</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice I could attain the necessary delicacy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">handling. Still, such was the fury of my ambition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such the untiring perseverance of my experiments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, difficult of credit as it may be, in the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one year I became theoretically and practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">an accomplished microscopist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During this period of my labors, in which I sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted specimens of every substance that came</seg><seg type="columnLine">under my observation to the action of my lenses, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a discoverer,--in a small way, it is true,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I was very young, but still a discoverer. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was I who destroyed Ehrenberg's theory that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Volvox globator was an animal, and proved that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">"monads" with stomachs and eyes were merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">phases of the formation of a vegetable cell, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, when they reached their mature state, incap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able of the act of conjugation, or any true genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive act, without which no organism rising to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage of life higher than vegetable can be said to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete. It was I who resolved the singular prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem of rotation in the cells and hairs of plants into</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciliary attraction, in spite of the assertions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Wenham and others, that my explanation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result of an optical illusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But notwithstanding these discoveries, labori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously and painfully made as they were, I ftelt</seg><seg type="columnLine">horribly dissatisfied. At every step I found myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped by the imperfections of my instruments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like all active microscopists, I gave my imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">full play. Indeed, it is a common complaint against</seg><seg type="columnLine">many such, that they supply the defects of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments with the creations of their brains. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined depths beyond depths in nature which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limited power of my lenses prohibited me from</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploring. I lay awake at night constructing</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginary microscopes of immeasurable power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which I seemed to pierce through all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelopes of matter down to its original atom. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">I cursed those imperfect media which necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">through ignorance compelled me to use! How I</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to discover the secret of some perfect lens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose magnifying power should be limited only</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DIAMOND LENS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">837</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by the resolvability of the object, and which at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time should be free from spherical and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chromatic aberrations, in short from all the obstacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">over which the poor microscopist finds himself con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinually stumbling! I felt convinced that the sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple microscope, composed of a single lens of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast yet perfect power was possible of construction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To attempt to bring the compound microscope up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to such a pitch would have been commencing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrong end; this latter being simply a partially</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful endeavor to remedy those very defects</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the simple instrument, which, if conquered, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave nothing to be desired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Working On the Manufacture of Microscopes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was in this mood of mind that I became a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structive microscopist. After another year pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed in this new pursuit, experimenting on every</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginable substance,--glass, gems, flints, crystals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial crystals formed of the alloy of various</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitreous materials,--in short, having constructed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">many varieties of lenses as Argus had eyes, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found znyself precisely where I started, with noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gained save an extensive knowledge of glass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">making. I was almost dead with despair. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents were surprised at my apparent want of</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress in my medical studies, (I had not attended</seg><seg type="columnLine">one lecture since my arrival in the city,) and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expenses of my mad pursuit had been so great as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to embarrass me very seriously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was in this frame of mind one day, experiment-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in my laboratory on a small diamond,--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, from its great refracting power, having al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways occupied my attention more than any other,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a young Frenchman, who lived on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">above me, and who was in the habit of occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">visiting me, entered the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In Search of a Diamond Microscope Lens</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I THINK that Jules Simon was a Jew. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">many traits of the Hebrew character: a love of</seg><seg type="columnLine">iewelry, of dress, and of good living. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">iomething mysterious about him.

When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was first furnishing my rooms, he paid me a visit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which ended in my purchasing an antique silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp, which he assured me was a Cellini,--it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">handsome enough even for that,--and some other</seg><seg type="columnLine">knickknacks for my sitting-room. Why Simon</seg><seg type="columnLine">should pursue this petty trade I never could imagine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He apparently had plenty of money, and had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entree of the best houses in the city,--taking care,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, I suppose, to drive no bargains within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enchanted circle of the Upper Ten. I came at length</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the conclusion that this peddling was but a mask</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cover some greater object, and even went so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to believe my young acquaintance to be implicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the slave-trade. That, however, was none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my affair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On the present occasion, Simon entered my room</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a state of considerable excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ahl mon ami!" he cried, before I could even</seg><seg type="columnLine">.offer him the ordinary salutation, "it has occurred</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to me to be the witness of the most astonishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">things in the world.

I handed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sheets of paper that were on the table, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pencil. The latter she held loosely in her hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which presently began to move over the paper with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a singular and seemingly involuntary motion.

A pause of a minute or so now ensued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">during which Mrs. Vulpes remained perfectly silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the raps continued at regular intervals. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the short period I mention had elapsed, the hand of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the medium was again seized with its convulsive</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremor, and she wrote, under this strange influence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few words on the paper, which she handed to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were as follows:--*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am here.

Some such theory may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have passed through my head, it is true; but if so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had forgotten it.

The raps followed us as we went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the hall, sounding on the balusters, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooring, and even the lintels of the door. I hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed my satisfaction, and escaped hurriedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cool night air. I walked home with but</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thought possessing me,--how to obtain a dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mond of the immense size required. My entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">means multiplied a hundred times over would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been inadequate to its purchase.

The diamond which I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quire you could not possess; or, if you did possess</seg><seg type="columnLine">dt, you would not be living here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something in my tone must have completely reas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isured him; for his expression immediately changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a sort of constrained merriment, combined, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, with a certain suspicious attention to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements. He laughed, and said that I must bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him; that he was at certain moments subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a speoies of vertigo, which betrayed itself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">incoherent speeches, and that the attacks passed off</seg><seg type="columnLine">as rapidly as they came. He put his weapon aside</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">while making this explanation, and endeavored, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some success, to assume a more cheerful air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this did not impose on me in the least. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much accustomed to analytical labors to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">baffled by so flimsy a veil. I determined to probe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery to the bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Simon," I said gayly, "let us forget all this over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bottle of Burgundy. I have a case of Lausseure's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clos Vougeot down-stairs, fragrant with the odors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ruddy with the sunlight of the Cote d'Or. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us have up a couple of bottles. What say you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"With all my heart," answered Simon, smilingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I produced the wine and we seated ourselves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink. It was of a famous vintage, that of 1848, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year when war and wine throve together,--and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure but powerful juice seemed to impart renewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitality to the system. By the time we had half</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished the second bottle, Simon's head, which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew was a weak one, had begun to yield, while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained calm as ever, only that every draught</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to send a flush of vigor through my limbs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simon's utterance became more and more indistinct.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took to singing French chansons of a not very</seg><seg type="columnLine">moral tendency. I rose suddenly from the table just</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the conclusion of one of those incoherent</seg><seg type="columnLine">verses, and, fixing my eyes on him with a quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, said: "Simon, I have deceived you. I learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">your secret this evening. You may as well be frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me. Mrs. Vulpes, or rather one of her spirits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Wonderful Rose Diamond</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE started with horror. His intoxication seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the moment to fade away, and he made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement towards the weapon that he had a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time before laid down. I stopped him with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Monster" he cried, passionately, "I am ruined!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What shall I do? You shall never have it! I swear</seg><seg type="columnLine">by my mother!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't want it," I said; "rest secure, but be</seg><seg type="columnLine">frank with me. Tell me all about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drunkenness began to return. He protested</seg><seg type="columnLine">with maudlin earnestness that I was entirely mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken,--that I was intoxicated; then asked me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swear eternal secrecy, and promised to disclose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery to me. I pledged myself, of course, to all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With an uneasy look in his eyes, and hands unsteady</seg><seg type="columnLine">with drink and nervousness, he drew a small case</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his breast and opened it. Heavens! How the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mild lamp-light was shivered into a thousand pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic arrows, as it fell upon a vast rose-diamond</seg><seg type="columnLine">that glittered in the case! I was no judge of dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monds, but I saw at a glance that this was a gem of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare size and purity. I looked at Simon with won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, and--must I confess it?--with envy. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he have obtained this treasure? In reply to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my questions, I could just gather from his drunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">statements (of which, I fancy, half the incoherence</seg><seg type="columnLine">was affected) that he had been superintending a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang of slaves engaged in diamond-washing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brazil; that he had seen one of them secrete a</seg><seg type="columnLine">diamond, but, instead of informing his employers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had quietly watched the negro until he saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">bury his treasure; that he had dug it up and fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it, but that as yet he was afraid to attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispose of it publicly,--so valuable a gem being</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost certain to attract too much attention to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">840</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">owner's antecedents,~and he had not been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover any of those obscure channels by which</seg><seg type="columnLine">such matters are conveyed away safely. He added,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, in accordance with the oriental practice* he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had named his diamond with the fanciful title of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Eye of Morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Simon was relating this to me, I regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great diamond attentively. Never had I beheld</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything so beautiful. All the glories of light, ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined or described, seemed to pulsate in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystalline chambers. Its weight, as I learned from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simon, was exactly one hundred and forty carats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here was an amazing coincidence. The hand of</seg><seg type="columnLine">destiny seemed in it. On the very evening when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit of Leeuwenhoek communicatee to me the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of the microscope, the priceless means which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he directs me to employ start up within my easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach! I determined, with the most perfect delib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eration, to possess myself of Simon's diamond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He Murders the Dealer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I SAT opposite to him while he nodded over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass, and calmly revolved the whole affair. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not for an instant contemplate so foolish an act</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a common theft, which would of course be dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered, or at least necessitate flight and conceal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, all of which must interfere with my scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans. There was but one step to be taken,--to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simon. After all, what was the life of a little ped-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dling Jew, in comparison with the interests of</seg><seg type="columnLine">science? Human beings are taken every day from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the condemned prisons to be experimented on by</seg><seg type="columnLine">surgeons. This man, Simon, was by his own con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fession a criminal, a robber, and I believed on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul a murderer. He deserved death quite as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any felon condemned by the laws: why should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not I, like the government, contrive that his punish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment should contribute to the progress of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The means for accomplishing everything I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sired lay within my reach. There stood upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mantelpiece a bottle half full of French laudanum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simon was so occupied with his diamond, which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just restored to him, that it was an affair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">no difficulty to drug his glass. In a quarter of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoar he was in a profound sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I now opened his waistcoat, took the diamond</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the inner pocket in which he had placed it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and removed him to the bed, on which I laid him</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that his feet hung down over the edge. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed myself of the Malay creese, which I held</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my right hand, while with the other I discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">as accurately as I could by pulsation the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">locality of the heart. It was essential that all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspects of his death should lead to the surmise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-murder. I calculated the exact angle at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was probable that the weapon, if levelled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simon's own hand, would enter his breast; then with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one powerful blow I thrust it up to the hilt in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very spot which I desired to penetrate. A con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsive thrill ran through Simon's limbs. I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smothered sound issue from his throat, precisely</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the bursting of a large air-bubble, sent up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a diver, when it reaches the surface of the water;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned half round on his side, and, as if to assist</seg><seg type="columnLine">my plans more effectually, his right hand, moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some mere spasmodic impulse, clasped the han-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of the creese, which it remained holding with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary muscular tenacity. Beyond this</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no apparent struggle. The laudanum, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">presume, paralyzed the usual nervous action. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have died instantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was yet something to be done. To make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it certain that all suspicion of the act should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">diverted from any inhabitant of the house to Simon</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, it was necessary that the door should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in the morning locked on the inside. How to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do this, and afterwards escape myself? Not by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window; that was a physical impossibility. Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was determined that the windows also should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found bolted. The solution was simple enough. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended softly to my own room for a peculiar in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strument which I had used for holding small slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pery substances, such as minute spheres of glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">etc. This instrument was nothing more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long slender hand-vice, with a very powerful grip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a considerable leverage, which last was acci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dentally owing to the shape of the handle. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was simpler than, when the key was in the lock, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seize the end of its stem in this vice, through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">keyhole, from the outside, and so lock the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Previously, however, to doing this, I burned a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of papers on Simon's hearth. Suicides almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">always burn papers before they destroy themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I also emptied some more laudanum into Simon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasB,--having first removed from it all traces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine,--cleaned the other wine-glass, and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottles away with me. If traces of two persons</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking had been found in the room, the question</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally would have arisen, Who was the second?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, the wine-bottles might have been identified</seg><seg type="columnLine">as belonging to me. The laudanum I poured out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">account for its presence in his stomach, in case of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">post-mortem examination. The theory naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be, that he first intended to poison himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, after swallowing a little of the drug, was either</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgusted with its taste, or changed his mind from</seg><seg type="columnLine">other motives, and chose the dagger. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangements made, I walked out, leaving the gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning, locked the door with my vice, and went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Verdict of Suicide</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SIMON'S death was not discovered until nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">three in the afternoon. The servant, astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">at seeing the gas burning,--the light streaming on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark landing from under the door,--peeped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the keyhole and saw Simon on the bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She gave the alarm. The door was burst open, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neighborhood was in a fever of excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every one in the house was arrested, myself in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded. There was an inquest; but no clew to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">death beyond that of suicide could be obtained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Curiously enough, he had made several speeches to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friends the preceding week, that seemed to point</seg><seg type="columnLine">to self-destruction. One gentleman swore that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simon had said in his presence that "he was tired of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life." His landlord affirmed that Simon, when pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him his last month's rent, remarked that "he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not pay him rent much longer." All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other evidence corresponded,--the door locked in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, the position of the corpse, the burnt papers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I anticipated, no one knew of the possession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diamond by Simon, so that no motive was sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested for his murder.

I had constructed a vast galvanic bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery, composed of nearly two thousand pairs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates,--a higher power I dared not use, lest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diamond should be calcined. By means of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous engine I was enabled to send a powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">current of electricity continually through my great</seg><seg type="columnLine">diamond, which it seemed to me gained in lustre</seg><seg type="columnLine">every day. At the expiration of a month I com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced the grinding and polishing of the lens, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of intense toil and exquisite delicacy. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great density of the stone, and the care required to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be taken with the curvatures of the surfaces of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lens, rendered the labor the severest and most har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assing that I had yet undergone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the eventful moment came; the lens was</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed. I stood trembling on the threshold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">new worlds. I had the realization of Alexander's</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous wish before me. The lens lay on the table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to be placed upon its platform. My hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly shook a3 I enveloped a drop of water with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin coating of oil of turpentine, preparatory to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">examination,--a process necessary in order to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent the rapid evaporation of the water. I now</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed the drop on a thin slip of glass under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lens, and throwing upon it, by the combined aid of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prism and a mirror, a powerful stream of light, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached my eye to the minute hole drilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the axis of the lens. For an instant I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing save what seemed to be an illuminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaos, a vast luminous abyss. A pure white light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloudless and serene, and seemingly limitless as</seg><seg type="columnLine">space itself, was my first impression. Gently, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the greatest care, I depressed the lens a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair's-breadths. The wondrous illumination still</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, but as the lens approached the object a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene of indescribable beauty was unfolded to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I seemed to gaze upon a vast space, the limits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which extended far beyond my vision. An atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere of magical luminousness permeated the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire field of view. I was amazed to see no trace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">animalculous life. Not a living thing, apparently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabited that dazzling expanse. I comprehended in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly that, by the wondrous power of my lens, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had penetrated beyond the grosser particles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">aqueous matter, beyond the realms of infusoria and</seg><seg type="columnLine">protozoa, down to the original gaseous globule, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose luminous interior I was gazing, as into an al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most boundless dome filled with 3 supernatural ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The First Visions of Beauty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was, however, no brilliant void into which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked. On every side I beheld beautiful or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganic forms, of unknown texture, and colored with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most enchanting hues. These forms presented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appearance of what might be called, for want</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a more specific definition, foliated clouds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest rarity; that is, they undulated and broke in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to vegetable formation!*, and wprp tinpprt with splen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dors compared with which the gilding of our autumn</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodlands is as dross compared with gold.

The pendent branches waved along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluid glades until every vista seemed to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">through half-lucent ranks of many-colored drooping</seg><seg type="columnLine">silken pennons. What seemed to be either fruits or</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers, pied with a thousand hues, lustrous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever varying, bubbled from the crowns of this fairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">foliage. No hills, no lakes, no rivers, no forms ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate or inanimate, were to be seen, save those vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">auroral copses that floated serenely in the luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">stillness, with leaves and fruits and flowers gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with unknown fires, unrealizable by mere ima-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How strange, I thought, that this sphere should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be thus condemned to solitude!

I looked more attentively, and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was not mistaken. Words cannot depict the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety with which I awaited the nearer approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this mysterious object. Was it merely some in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">animate substance, held in suspense in the atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uated atmosphere of the globule? Or was it an ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal endowed with vitality and motion? It ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached, flitting behind the gauzy, colored veils of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud-foliage, for seconds dimly revealed, then van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishing. At last the violet pennon3 that trailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest to me vibrated; they were gently pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside, and the form floated out into the broad light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Glorious Animula</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tT was a female human shape.

My attention was so entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed by her, that I could not apply myself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the task of determining whether this singular plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">was or was not instinct with volition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">More About His Love, Animula</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WATCHED her, with the most profound at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention as she made her repast, The suppleness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her motions sent a thrill of delight through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame; my heart beat madly as she turned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful eyes in the direction of the spot in which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. What would I not have given to have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power to precipitate myself into that luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean, and float with her through those groves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple and gold! While I was thus breathlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">following her every movement, she suddenly started,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to listen for a moment, and then cleaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brilliant ether in which she was floating, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash^oftlight, pierced through the opaline forest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly a series of the most singular sensations</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked me. It seemed as if I had suddenly gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind. The luminous sphere was still before me, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">my daylight had vanished. What caused this sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den disappearance ? Had she a lover or a husband ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes, that was the solution! Some signal from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy fellow-being had vibrated through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenues of the forest, and she had obeyed the sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The agony of my sensations, as I arrived at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion, startled me.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. I had no escape from it. I loved an animalcule!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is true that, thanks to the marvellous power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my microscope, she appeared of human proportions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead of presenting the revolting aspect of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarser creatures, that live and struggle and die, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more easily resolvable portions of the water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop, she was fair and delicate and of surpassing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty. But of what account was all that? Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">time that my eye was withdrawn from the instru-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, it fell on a miserable drop of water, within</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, I must be content to know, dwelt all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make my life lovely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Could she but see me once!

She tossed her lus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trous golden hair over her shoulders with innocent</seg><seg type="columnLine">coquetry. She lay at full length in the transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">medium, in which she supported herself with ease,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gambolled with the enchanting grace that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nymph Salamacis might have exhibited when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought to conquer the modest Hermaphroditus. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried an experiment to satisfy myself if her powers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reflection were developed. I lessened the lamp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light considerably. By the dim light that remained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see an expression of pain flit across her face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She looked upward suddenly, and her brows coi£</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted. I flooded the stage of the microscope again</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a full stream of light, and her whole expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. She sprang forward like some substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">deprived of all weight. Her eyes sparkled and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips moved. Ah! if science had only the means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">conducting and reduplicating sounds, as it does the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays of light, what carols of happiness would then</seg><seg type="columnLine">have entranced my ears! what jubilant hymns to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adonis would have thrilled the illumined air!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I now comprehended how it was that the Count</seg><seg type="columnLine">de Gabalis peopled his mystic world with sylphs,--■</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful beings whose breath of life was lambent</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, and who sported forever in regions of purest</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether and purest light.

Heavens! was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this the great enchantress that had drawn monarchs</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her chariot-wheels ? Those heavy muscular limbs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those thick ankles, those cavernous eyes, that stereo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">typed smile, those crudely painted cheeks!

What gross, discordant</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements! The play of her limbs was all false and</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could bear it no longer; with an exclamation of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gust that drew every eye upon me, I rose from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat in the very middle of the Signorina's pas-de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascination, and abruptly quitted the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hastened home to feast my eyes once more on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lovely form of my sylph.

I believe at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment I would have gladly forfeited all claims</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my human birthright, if I could only have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarfed to the size of an animalcule, and permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to console her from whom fate had forever divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I racked my brain for the solution of this mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery.

The wondrous forests appeared also</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have lost half their beauty. Their hues were dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in some places faded away altogether. I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">Animula for hours with a breaking heart, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed absolutely to wither away under my very</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye. Suddenly I remembered that I had not looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the water-drop for several days. In fact, I hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see it; for it reminded me of the natural barrier</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Animula and myself. I hurriedly looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the stage of the microscope. The slide was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still there,--but, great heavens! the water-drop had</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished 1 The awful truth burst upon me; it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">evaporated, until it had become so minute as to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible to the naked eye; I had been gazing on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">last atom, the one that contained Animula,--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was dying!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Disappearance of Animulai</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I rushed again to the front of the lens, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">through.

The condensation of the nebula,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">845</seg><seg type="columnLine">846</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he declared, was likely to begin any minute, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the downpour would be so fierce that a person</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be drowned in the open field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came even sooner than he had anticipated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the results that we had already noted in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York. At first many thought that the ark itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be destroyed, so dreadful was the impact of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the falling water. The women and children, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the men, were seized with panic, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo had great difficulty in reassuring them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The flood will not reach us for several hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet," he said. "The level of the water must rise at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least a hundred feet more before we shall be afloat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inside here we are perfectly safe. The ark is ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceedingly strong and absolutely tight. You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to fear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he ordered an ingenious sound-absorbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen, which he had prepared, to be drawn over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great ceiling of the saloon, the effect of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to shut out the awful noise of the water roar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon the roof of the ark. A silence that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first startling by contrast to the preceding din</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevailed as soon as the screen was in place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amid a hush of expectancy, Cosmo now mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dais at one end of the room. Never before had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intellectual superiority of the man seemed so</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident. His huge "dome of thought," surmount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his slight body, dominated the assembly like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front of Jove. Chairs near him were occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Professor Jeremiah Moses, Professor Abel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Able, Professor Alexander Jones, and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">"speculative geniuses" whom he had named to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joseph Smith. These were Costak6 Theriad6, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rumania, a tall, dark, high-browed thinker, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was engaged in devising ways to extract and recover</seg><seg type="columnLine">intra-atomic energy; and Sir Wilfred Athelstone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose specialty was bio-chemistry, and who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to have produced amazing results in artificial</seg><seg type="columnLine">parthenogenesis and the production of new species.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as attention was concentrated upon him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo Vers&amp;l began to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My friends," he said, "the world around us is</seg><seg type="columnLine">now sinking beneath a flood that will not be ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested until America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Australia have disappeared.

After a considerable inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">val, during which no one spoke above his breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Abel Abl? arose and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The gratitude which we owe to this man"-- in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicating Cosmo Versal, "can best be expressed, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in words, but by acts.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">now wish to ask if he can foresee where upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">re-emerging planet a foothold is first likely to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained. Where lies our land of promise?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can answer that question," Cosmo replied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"only in general terms.

In its western part it lies from</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourteen to seventeen or eighteen thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the ordinary level of the sea.

Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first considerable area is likely to be uncovered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is upon the Pamirs, the 'Roof of the World,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we shall probably make our landing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May I ask," said Professor Abel Able, "in what</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner you expect the waters of the flood to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrawn, after the earth is completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," was the reply, "was one of the funda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental questions that I examined, but I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">care to enter into a discussion of it now.

The new cradle of mankind will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">located near the old one, and the roses of the Vale</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Cashmere will canopy it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo Vers&amp;l's words made a profound impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion upon his hearers, and awoke thoughts that</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried their minds off into strange reveries. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">more questions were asked, and gradually the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblage broke up into groups of interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">talkers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was near midnight. Cosmo, beckoning Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Abel Able, Professor Alexander Jones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Professor Jeremiah Moses to accompany him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his way out of the saloon, and, secretly open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one of the gangway doors, they presently stood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheltering themselves from the pouring rain, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a position which enabled them to look toward New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECOND DELUGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">847</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing, of course, was visible through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">downpour; but they were startled at hearing fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful cries issuing out of the darkness. The rural</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of the city, filled with gardens and villas, lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">round within a quarter of a mile of the ark, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound, accelerated by the water-charged at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere, struck upon their ears with terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctness. Sometimes, when a gust of wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew the rain in to their faces, the sound deepened</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a long, despairing wail, which seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne from afar off, mingled with the roar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">descending torrent--the death-cry of the vast me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropolis !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Merciful Heaven, I cannot endure this!" cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Moses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go to my cabin," Cosmo yelled in his ear, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the others with you. I will join you there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little while. I wish to measure the rate of rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They gladly left him, and fled into the interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ark. Cosmo procured an electric lamp; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment its light streamed out he perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the water had already submerged the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">cradle in which the ark rested, and was beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to creep up the metallic aides. He lowered a grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uated tape into it, provided with an automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">register. In a few minutes he had completed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">task, and then he went to rejoin his late compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions in his cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In about an hour," he said to them, "we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">be afloat. The water is rising at the rate of one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirtieth of an inch per second."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No more than that?" asked Professor Jones</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an accent of surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is quite enough," Cosmo replied. "One-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thi-rtieth of an inch per second means two inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a minute, and ten feet in an hour. In twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours from now the water will stand two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and forty feet above its present level, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then only the tallest structures in New York will</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift their tops above it, if indeed, they are not long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before overturned by undermining or the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the waves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it will be a Jong time before the hills and</seg><seg type="columnLine">highlands are submerged," suggested Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones. "Are you perfectly sure that the flood will</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo Vers&amp;l looked at his interlocutor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is truly a disappointment to me," he said at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, "to find that, even now, remnants of doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">cling to your minds. I tell you that the nebula is</seg><seg type="columnLine">condensing at its maximum rate. It is likely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue to do so for at least four months. In four</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, at the rate of two inches per minute, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level of the water will rise 28,800 feet. There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one peak in the world which is surely known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attain a slightly greater height than that--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mount Everest, in the Himalayas. Even in a sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle month the rise will amount to 7,200 feet. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is 611 feet higher than the loftiest mountain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Appalachians.

Farmhouses, barns, villas, trees, ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals, human beings--all were swept away together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only on broad elevated plateaus, where higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">points rose above the general level, were a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the inhabitants able to find a kind of refuge. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking these high places, and sheltering them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves as best they could among immovable rocks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they succeeded, at least, in delaying their fate. Not-</seg><seg type="columnLine">withstanding the fact that the atmosphere was filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with falling water, they could yet breathe, if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept the rain from striking directly in their faces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was owing to this circumstance, and to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary occurrences which we shall have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">relate, that the fate of the human race was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">precisely that which Cosmo Versal had predicted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We quitted the scene in New York when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of night had just fallen, and turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom of the watery atmosphere into impenetrable</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.

That place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk deep beneath the waters. All of the cruisers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">battleships, and other vessels that had been at</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchor or at moorings there had gone under. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">only, the boast of the American navy, the uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">querable Uncle Sam, which, in the last great war</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the world had known, had borne the starry flag</seg><seg type="columnLine">to victories whose names broke men's voices and</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled their eyes with tears of pride, had escaped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the incomparable seamanship of Capt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robert Decatur, who had been her commander for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But though the Uncle Sam managed to float upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rising flood, she was unable to get away be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the obstructions lodged about the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridges that spanned the East River. A curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">eddy that the raging currents formed over what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was once the widest part of that stream kept her</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolving round and round, never departing far</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any direction, and, with majestic strength, riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">down or brushing aside the floating timbers, wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses, and other wreckage that pounded against</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mighty steel sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just at the time when the waters had mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the eighteenth story of the beleaguered Municipal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Building, a sudden change occurred in these cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rents. They swept westward with resistless force,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Uncle Sam was carried directly over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned city. First she encountered the cables of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Manhattan Bridge, striking them near the west-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern tower, and, swinging round, wrenched the tower</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself from its foundations and hurled it beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she rushed on, riding with the turbid flood</seg><seg type="columnLine">high above the buried roofs, finding no other ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction in her way until she approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Municipal Building, which was stoutly resisting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">push of the waves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those who were near the windows and on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balconies, on the eastern side of the building, saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great battleship coming out of the gray gloom</seg><seg type="columnLine">like some diluvian monster, and before they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehend what it was, it crashed, prow on, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steel-ribbed walls, driving them in as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the armored sides of an enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So tremendous was the momentum of the strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mass that the huge vessel passed, like a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectile, through walls and floors and partitions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as she emerged in the central court the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast structure came thundering down upon her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and building together sank beneath the boil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing waves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But out of the awful tangle of steel girders, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped the air and the water as if some terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">spidery life yet clung to them, by one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracles of chance which defy all the laws of</seg><seg type="columnLine">probability and reason, a small boat of levium, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had belonged to the Uncle Sam, was cast forth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated away, half submerged but unsinkable; and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to its thwarts, struggling for breath, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sane with terror, were two men, the sole survivors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all those thousands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of them was a seaman who had taken ref-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uge, with a crowd of comrades, in the boat before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battleship rushed down upon the building. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his comrades had been hurled out and lost when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blow came, while his present companion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept in and lodged against the thwarts. And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">those two waifs drove off in the raging waves. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them were bleeding from many wounds, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had no fatal hurts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boat, though filled with water, was so light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it could not sink. Moreover, it was ballasted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and amid all its wild gyrations it kept right side</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. Even the ceaseless downpour from the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not drive it beneath the waves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while the currents that had been setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward changed their direction, and the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was driven toward the north. It swept on past</seg><seg type="columnLine">toppling sky-scrapera until it was over the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Madison Square once spread its lawns, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon by gigantic structures, most of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had now either crumbled and disappeared or were</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying to their fall. Here there was an eddy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat turned round and round amid floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">debris until two other draggled creatures, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been clinging to floating objects, succeeded by des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate efforts in pulling themselves into it. Others</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried but failed, and no one lent a helping hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those who were already in the boat neither opposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor aided the efforts of those who battled to enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. No words were heard in the fearful uproar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">only inarticulate cries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the current changed again, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, with its dazed occupants, was hurried off</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the Hudson. Night was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning once more to drop an obscuring curtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the scene, and under that curtain the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">throes of drowning New York were hidden. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun again faintly illuminated the western hem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isphere the whole Atlantic seaboard was buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the water rose higher, Cosmo Versal's Ark</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last left its cradle, and cumbrously floated off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving first eastward, then turning in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Brooklyn and Manhattan. Cosmo had his engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">in operation, but their full power was not developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as he had expected, and the great vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted at the will of the currents and the wind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter coming now from one side and now from</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, rising at times to hurricane strength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then dying away until only a spanking breeze swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ever-falling rain into swishing sheets. Occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionally the wind failed entirely, and for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes at a time the water fell in vertical streams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length the motive power of the Ark was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped, and it began to obey its helm. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter of a "captain's bridge," constructed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward end of the huge levium dome that covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel, Cosmo Versal, with Captain Arms, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">veteran navigator in whose skill he confided, peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the interminable waste of waters. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing in sight except floating objects that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">welled up from the drowned city and the surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">850</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing villages. Here and there the body of an animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">or of a human being was seen in the tossing waves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Cosmo Versal sadly shook his head as he point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed them out, but the stout mariner at his side</seg><seg type="columnLine">chewed his tobacco, and paid attention only to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties, shouting orders from time to time through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a speaking-tube, or touching an electric button.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo Vers&amp;l brought a rain-gauge and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again allowed it to fill itself. The story was</seg><seg type="columnLine">always the same--two inches per minute, ten feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">per hour, the water mounted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nebula had settled down to regular work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, if Cosmo's calculations were sound, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no intermission for four months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the power of the propellers had been de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped the Ark was steered south-eastward. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress was very slow. In the course of eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours it had not gone more than fifty miles. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">night came on, and the speed was reduced until there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only sufficient way to insure the command of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel's movements. Powerful search-lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">were employed as long as the stygian darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the return of the pallid light, at what</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been daybreak, Cosmo and his navigator</seg><seg type="columnLine">were again at their post. In fact, the former had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not slept at all, keeping watch through the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, with Captain Arms within easy call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the light became stronger, Cosmo said to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steer toward New York. I wish to see if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last of the tall buildings on the upper heights have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone under."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will be very dangerous to go that way,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">objected Captain Arms. "There are no landmarks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we may strike a snag."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not if we are careful," replied Cosmo. "All</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the highest ground is now buried very deep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is taking a fool's risk," growled Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arms, but nevertheless he obeyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was true that they had nothing to go by. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">air was too thick with water, and the light too</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble for them to be able to lay their course by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighting the distant hills of New Jersey which yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained above the level of the flood. Still, by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of seaman's instinct, Captain Arms made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, until he felt that he ought to venture no</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther. He had just turned to Cosmo Versal with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intention of voicing his protest, when the Ark</seg><seg type="columnLine">careened slightly, shivered from stem to stern, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then began a bumping movement that nearly threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men from their feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are aground!" cried the captain, and In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly turned a knob that set in motion automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery which cut off the engines from the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pellers, and at the same time slowed down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"A Billion for a Share"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TtE Ark had lodged on the loftiest part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palisades. It was only after long and careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">study of their position, rendered possible by</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional glimpses of the Orange Hills and high</seg><seg type="columnLine">points further up the course of the Hudson, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo Vers&amp;l and Captain Arms were able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach that conclusion. Where New York had stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing was visible but an expanse of turbid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But suppose the hard trap rocks had penetrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the Ark! It was a contingency too</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible to be thought of. Yet the facts must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascertained at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo, calling Joseph Smith, and commanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to go among the frightened passengers and as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure them, in his name, that there was no danger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried, with the captain and a few trusty men, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bowels of the vessel. They thoroughly sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom plates. No aperture and no indentation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, then, the bottom was double, and the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates might have been perforated. If this had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened the fact would reveal itself through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leakage of water into the intervening space. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascertain if that had occurred it was necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">unscrew the covers of some of the manholes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner skin of levium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an anxious moment when they cautiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed one of these covers. At the last turns of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screw the workman who handled it instinctively</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned his head aside, and made ready for a spring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than half expecting that the cover would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven from his hands, and a stream of water would</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the cover remained in place after it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely loosened, and until it had been lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. A sigh of relief broke from every breast. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">water was visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Climb in there, and explore the bottom," Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a space of eighteen inches between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two bottoms, which were connected and braced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the curved ribs of the hull. A man immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared in the opening and began the explora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Cosmo ordered the removal of other covers</seg><seg type="columnLine">at various points, and the exploration was extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the whole bottom. He himself passed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the manholes and aided in the work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last it was determined, beyond any doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even the outer skin was uninjured. Not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as a dent could be found in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the favor of Providence," said Cosmo Versal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his head emerged from a manhole, "the Ark</seg><seg type="columnLine">has touched upon a place where the rocks are cover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed with soil, and no harm has come to us. In a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">short time the rising water will lift us off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And, with my consent, you'll do no more navigat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over hills and mountains," grumbled Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arms. "The open sea for the sailor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The covers were carefully replaced, and the party,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in happier spirits, returned to the upper decks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the good news was quickly spread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fact was that while the inspection was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der way the Ark had floated off, and when Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the captain reached their bridge the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been left in charge reported that the vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">had swung halfway round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's headed for the old Atlantic," sung out</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Arms. "The sooner we're off the better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before the captain could signal the order</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECOND DELUGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">851</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to go ahead, Cosmo Vers£l laid his hand on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a moment; listen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the lashing oi the rain a voice pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated with a sound between a call and a scream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There could be no doubt that it was human. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain and Cosmo looked at one another in speech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less astonishment. The idea that any one outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ark could have survived, and could now be</seg><seg type="columnLine">afloat amid this turmoil of waters, had not occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their minds. They experienced a creeping of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nerves. In a few minutes the voice came again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">louder than before, and the words that it pronoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ced being now clearly audible, the two listeners</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not believe their ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cosmo Versal!" it yelled. "Cosm-o-o Ver-sa-al!</seg><seg type="columnLine">A billion for a share! A billion, I say, a bil-li-on</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a share I1*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they perceived, a little way off to the left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something which looked like the outline of a boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk to the gunwales, washed over by every wave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and standing in it, up to their knees in water, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">four men, one of whom was gesticulating violently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the others seemed dazed and incapable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntary movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the boat of levium that had been thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the wreckage when the battleship ran down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Municipal tower, and we must now follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread of its adventures up to the time of its en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter with the Ark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the boat was driven westward from the drown-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed site of Madison Square it gradually freed itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the objects floating around, most of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon sunk, and in an hour or two its inmates were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone--the sole survivors of a population of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alone they were in impenetrable darkness, for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we have said, night had by this time once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen. They floated on, half drowned, chilled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bone, not trying to speak, not really conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one another's presence. The rain beat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them, the waves washed over them, the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinkable boat sluggishly rose and fell with the heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the water, and occasionally they were nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung overboard by a sudden lurch--and yet they</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung with desperate tenacity to the thwarts, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if life were still dear, as if they thought that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might yet survive, though the world was drowned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus hours passed, and. at last a glimmer appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed in the streaming air, and a faint light stole over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of the water. If they saw one another, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was with unrecognizing eyes. They were devoured</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hunger, but they did not know it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly one of them--it was he who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so miraculously thrown into the boat when it shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the tangle of falling beams and walls--raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head and threw up his arms, a wild light gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a hoarse, screaming voice he yelled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cosmo Versal!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No other syllables that the tongue could shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have produced the effect of that name.

In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first place it was seen that no kind of airship could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be successfully provisioned for a flight of indefinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, and in the second place the probable strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the winds, or the crushing weight of the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scending water, in case, as Cosmo predicted, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nebula should condense upon the earth, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">either sweep an aero or a balloon to swift destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, or carry it down into the waves like a water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soaked butterfly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly, when a few Frenchmen began seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously to consider the question of providing a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of escape from the flood--always supposing, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sake of argument, that there would be a flood</seg><seg type="columnLine">--they got together, under the leadership of an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineer officer named Yves de Beauxchamps, and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussed the matter in all its aspects.

This stage in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress of the coming disaster was accentuated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe by the existence of the vast glaciers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alps.

At the beginning the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and continuous rain kept down the waves, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the sea was comparatively smooth, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a while a curious phenomenon began to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed; immense billows would suddenly appear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing upon the ark now from one direction and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now from another, canting it over at a dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle, and washing almost to the top of the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">ellipsoid of the dome. At such times it was difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">for anybody to maintain a footing, and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">great terror among the passengers.

But at last the explanation came</seg><seg type="columnLine">of itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both Cosmo and the captain happened to be on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge together when they saw ahead something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that looked like an enormous column as black as ink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing upright on the surface of the water. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance showed that it was in swift motion, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than that, was approaching in a direct line</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Ark. In less than two minutes It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The instant that it met the Ark a terrific roaring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deafened them, and the rounded front of the dome</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath their eyes disappeared under a deluge .of</seg><seg type="columnLine">descending water so dense that the vision oould</seg><seg type="columnLine">not penetrate it. In another half minute the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel seemed to have been driven to the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea.

Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrable darkness surrounded them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the buoyant vessel shook itself, rolled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">side to side, and rose with a staggering motion un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til it seemed to be poised on the summit of a watery</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain* Immediately the complete darkness pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, the awful downpour ceased, although the rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">still fell in torrents, and the Ark began to glide</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward with sickening velocity, as if it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding down a liquid slope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a considerable time before the two men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to the supports of the bridge, were able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to maintain their equilibrium sufficiently to render</seg><seg type="columnLine">it possible to utter a few connected words. As soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he could speak with reasonable comfort Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now I see what it is that causes the billows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it is a phenomenon that I should never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipated.

He found that while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk of the sun was completely hidden in the watery</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, yet it was possible to determine its location by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of the varying intensity of the light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where the sun was, a concentrated glow appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shading gradually off on all sides. With infinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">pains Cosmo, assisted by the experience of the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain, succeeded in determining the center of maxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mum illumination, and, assuming that to represent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the true place of the sun, they got something in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nature of observations for altitude and azimuth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Capt. Arms even drew on his chart "Sumner</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines'* to determine the position of the Ark, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he smiled at the thought of their absurd</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaccuracy. Still, it was the best they could do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was better than nothing at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They kept a log going also, although, as the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain pointed out, it was not of much use to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how fast they were traveling, since they could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the precise direction, within a whole point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compass, or perhaps several points.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Besides," he remarked, "what do we know of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the currents? This is not the old Atlantic. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could feel the Gulf Stream I'd know whereabouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was, but these currents come from all directions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a man might as well try to navigate in a tub</seg><seg type="columnLine">of boiling water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we can, at least, keep working eastward,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Cosmo. "My idea is first to make enough south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to get into the latitude of the Sahara Desert,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then run directly east, so as to cross Africa</seg><seg type="columnLine">where there are no mountains, and where we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">be certain of having plenty of water under our</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, having got somewhere in the neighborhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Suez, we can steer down into the region of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian ocean, and circle round south of the Hima-</seg><seg type="columnLine">layas. I want to keep an eye on those mountains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stay around the place where they disappear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because that will be the first part of the earth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerge from the flood and it is there that we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultimately make land."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we're averaging eight knots," said the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain, " and at that rate we ought to be In the longi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude of the African coast in about twenty days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How high will the water stand then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My gages show," replied Cosmo, "that the regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar fall amounts to exactly the same thing a9 at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning--two inches a minute. Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spouts increase the amount locally, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't think that they add materially to the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise of the flood. Two inches per minute means</seg><seg type="columnLine">4,800 feet in twenty days. That'll be sufficient to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make safe navigation for us all the way across</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern Africa. We'll have to be careful in get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting out into the Indian Ocean area, for there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains on both sides that might give us trouble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the higher ones will still be in sight, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will serve to indicate the location of the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranges already submerged, but not covered deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to afford safe going over them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," said Captain Arms, "you're the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modore, but if we don't hang our timbers on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountain of the Moon, or the Alps, or old Ararat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm a porpoise. Why can't you keep circling round</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a safe distance, in the middle of the Atlantic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until all these reefs get a good depth of water on</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because," Cosmo replied, "even if we keep right</seg><seg type="columnLine">on now it will probably take two months, allowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for delays in getting around dangerous places, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come within sight of the Himalayas, and in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">months the flood will have risen nearly 15,000 feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus hiding many of the landmarks. If we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold off here a couple of months before starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward nothing but the one highest peak on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe would be left in sight by the time we arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and that wouldn't be anything more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, so that with the uncertainty of our naviga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion we might not be able to find it at all. I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the spot where Tibet sinks, and then manage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep in its neighborhood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That ended the argument</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give me a safe port, with lights and bearings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'll undertake to hit it anywhere in the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemispheres, but blow me if I fancy steering for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the world by dead reckoning, or no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckoning at all," Capt Arms said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At night, of course, they had not even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight advantage that their observations of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable place of the sun gave them when it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the horizon. Then they had to go solely by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the indications of the compass. Still, they forged</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily ahead, and when they got into what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">deemed the proper latitude, they ran for the site</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the drowned Sahara.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After about a week the billowing motion caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the descent of the 'Hakes in the sky" ceased en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely, to their great delight, but the lawless nebula</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now preparing another surprise for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the ninth night after their departure from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lodgment on the Palisades Cosmo Versal was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping in his bunk close by the bridge, where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be called in an instant dreaming perhaps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glories of the new world that was to emerge out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the deluge, when he was abruptly awakened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voice of Capt.

The rain had entirely ceased. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the sea was almost as smooth as glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though rising and falling slowly, with a long, roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing motion. The Ark rode steadily, shivering, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ocean liner, under the impulse of its engines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sudden silence, succeeding the ceaseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of the downpour, which had never been out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ears from the start, of the voyage, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">supernatural.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When did this happen?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It began not more than five minutes ago.

As Cosmo had remarked, Plud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der had a good brain and great scientific acuteness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, although he did not believe in the nebular</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory of a flood, and was obstinately opposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that was not altogether regular and ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to recognized authority in science, yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not shut his eyes to the fact that something</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going wrong in the machinery of the heavens.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But It annoyed him to find that his own explanations</seg><seg type="columnLine">were always falsified by the event, while Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vers&amp;l seemed to have a superhuman fore-glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whatever happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His pride would not allow him to recede from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the position that he had taken, but he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">free himself from a certain anxiety about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. After he had refused Cosmo Vers&amp;I's In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitation, the course of events strengthened this</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety. He found that the official meteorologists</seg><seg type="columnLine">were totally unable to account for the marvelous</seg><seg type="columnLine">vagaries of the weather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, when the news came of tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">floods in the north, and of the overflowing of Hud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son Bay, he secretly determined to make some pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parations of his own. He still rejected the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a watery nebula, but he began to think it possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all the lowlands of the earth might be over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed by the sea, and by the melting of mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">snows and glaciers, together with deluging rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall. After what had passed, he could not think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">making any public confession of his change of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, but his sense of humanity compelled him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give confidential warning to his friends that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be well to be prepared to get on high ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a moment's notice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was on the point of issuing, but without his</seg><seg type="columnLine">signature, an official statement cautioning the pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic against unprecedented inundations, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first tidal wave arrived on the Atlantic coast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendered any utterance of that kind unnecessary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">People's eyes were opened, and now they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">look out for themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4$ludder's private preparations amounted to no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than the securing of a large express aero, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, if the necessity for suddenly leaving Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington should arise, he intended to take flight, to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether with President Samson, who was his per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal friend, and a number of other close friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their families. He did not think that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be necessary, in any event, to go farther than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains of Virginia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rising of the sea, mounting higher at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">return, at length convinced him that the time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to get away. Hundreds of air craft had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready departed westward, not only from Washing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, but from New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boston, and other seaboard cities, before Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pludder assembled his friends by telephone on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capitol grounds, where his aero was waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lower streets of the city were under water</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the overflow of the Potomac, which was back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed up by the influx of the Atlantic into Chesapeake</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bay, and the most distressing scenes were enacted</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, people fleeing in the utmost disorder toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher ground, carrying their children and some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of their household goods, and uttering doleful cries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many, thinking it the best way to escape, embarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in frail boats on the river, which was running up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream with, frightful velocity, and rising percep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tibly higher every second.

It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been impossible to make a landing in the midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the storm and the pouring water, which rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in torrents down the mountainside. Professor Plud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der was a brave man and full of resources when</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven into a corner. Being familiar with the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction and management of aeros, for he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">educated as an engineer, he now took charge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within twenty minutes after the sky had opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">its batteries--for the rain had almost the force of</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunging shot--a mighty wind arose, and the aero,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitching, tossing, and dipping like a mad thing, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven with frightful speed eastward. This wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush continued for more than an hour. By this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it was full night, and the pouring rain around</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was as impenetrable to the sight as a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had their electric lamps inside, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">search-lights, but it was impossible to tell where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were. Pludder turned the search-light down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, but he could not make out the features of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground beneath them. It is likely that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven at least as far as Chesapeake Bay, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have passed directly over Washington.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, however, the wind slewed round, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to blow with undiminished violence from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northeast. Plunging and swerving, and sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">860</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened with a complete somersault, the aero</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried away in its crazy flight, while its un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunate inmates clung to one another, and held on</seg><seg type="columnLine">by any object within reach, in the endeavor to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">from being dashed against the metallic walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crew of the aero were picked men, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience could have prepared them for the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they now had to do. Without the ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain of Professor PI udder to direct their efforts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without his personal exertions, their aerial</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship would have been wrecked within a quarter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour after the storm struck it. He seemed trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed into another person. Hatless and coatless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and streaming with water, he worked like a demon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was ready at each emergency with some device</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, under his direction, had the effect of magic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hundred times the aero plunged for the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but was saved and turned upward again just as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed on the point of striking. Up and down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and left, it ran and pitched and whirled, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cork in a whirlpool. Sometimes it actually skim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">med the ground, plowing its way through a torrent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rushing water, and yet it rose again and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved from destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This terrible contest lasted another hour after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the turning of the wind, and then the latter died</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Relieved from its pressure, the aero ran on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with comparative ease. Professor Pludder, suspect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that they might now be getting into a moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainous district, made every effort to keep the craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a high elevation, and this, notwithstanding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depressing force of the rain, they succeeded in do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. After the dying out of the wind they kept on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the aid of their propellers, in the same direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which it had been driving them, because, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances, one way was as good as another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The terrible discomfort of the President and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions in the cabin of the aero was greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieved by the cessation of the wind, but still they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in a most unfortunate state. The rain, driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the fierce blasts, had penetrated through every</seg><seg type="columnLine">crevice, and they were drenched to the skin. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">one tried to speak, for it would have been almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to make oneself heard amid the uproar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They simply looked at one another in dismay and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayed for safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Pludder, not now compelled to spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">every moment in the management of the craft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the cabin occasionally, pressed the hand of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the President, smiled encouragingly on the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">and children, and did all he could, in pantomime, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">restore some degree of confidence. Inside, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights were aglow, but outside it was as dark as</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitch, except where the broad finger of the search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, plunging into the mass of tumbling water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittered and flashed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The awful night seemed endless, but at last a pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumination appeared in the air, and they knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day had come. The spectacle of the sky de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luge was now so terrible that it struck cold even to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their already benumbed hearts. The atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have been turned into a mighty cataract</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundering down upon the whole face of the earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now that they could see as well as hear, the miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the preservation of the aero appeared incredible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the light slowly brightened, Professor Plud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">der, constantly on the outlook, caught a glimpse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dark, misty object ahead. It loomed up so sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, and was already so close, that before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently alter the course of the aero, it struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such violence as to crush the forward end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the craft and break one of the planes. Everybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pitched headforemost, those inside falling on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooring, while Pludder and the three men of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew were thrown out upon a mass of rocks. AD</seg><seg type="columnLine">were more or less seriously injured, but none was .</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed or totally disabled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pludder sprang to hjs feet, and, slipping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunging amid the downpour, managed to get back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wreck and aid the President and the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get upon their feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're lodged on a mountain!" he yelled. "Stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside, under the shelter of the roof!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three men who, together with the professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been precipitated out among the rocks, also</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled in, and there they stood, or sat, the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">disconsolate and despairing group of human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ever the eye of an overseeing Providence looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The President presented the most pitiable sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all. Like the rest, his garments were sopping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes were bloodshot, his face was ghastly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tall silk hat, which he had jammed down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brow, had been softened by the water and crush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed by repeated blows into the form of a closed ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordion- Of the women and children it is needless</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak; no description could convey an idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their condition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In these circumstances, the real strength of Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Abiel Pludder's mind was splendidly display-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. He did not lose his head, and he comprehended</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation, and what it was necessary to do, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash. He got out some provisions and distributed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to the company, in some cases actually forcing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to eat.' With his own hands he prepared cof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fee, with the apparatus always carried by express</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeros, and made them drink it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When all had thus been refreshed he approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">President Samson and shouted in his ear:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall have to stay here until the downpour</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceases. To guard against the effects of a tempeBt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if one should arise, we must secure the aero in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. For that I need the aid of every man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party. We have, fortunately, struck in a spot on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain where we are out of the way of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torrents of water that are pouring down through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ravines on either side. We can make our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodgment secure, but we must go to work imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stimulated by his example, the President and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others set to work, and with great difficulty, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had to guard their eyes and nostrils from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving rain, which, sometimes, in spite of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">precautions, nearly smothered them, they succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fastening the aero to the rocks by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic cables taken from its stores. When this</seg><seg type="columnLine">work was finished they returned under the shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cabin roof and lay down, exhausted. So worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">out were they that all of them quickly fell into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be needless to relate in detail the suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferings, mental and physical, that they underwent</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECOND DELUGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">861</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">daring the next ten days. While they were hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">there on the mountain the seaboard cities of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world were drowned, and Cosmo Vers&amp;l's Ark de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted on the remarkable voyage that has been des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cribed in a former chapter. They had plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">provisions, for the aero had been well stored, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly through precaution and partly because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of appetite they ate sparingly. The electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators of the aero had not been injured in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck of the craft, and they were able to supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves with sufficient heat and with light inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin at night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once they had a strange visitor--a half-drowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear, which had struggled up the mountain from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its den somewhere below--but that was the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">living creature beside themselves that they saw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After gazing wistfully at the aero from the top of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock the poor bear stumbled into one of the torrents</seg><seg type="columnLine">that poured furiously down on each side, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept from their sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately, the wind that they had anticipated</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not come, but frequently they saw or heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring downpours of solid watery columns like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those that had so much astonished Cosmo Vers&amp;l</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Captain Arms in the midst of the Atlantic, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">none came very near them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Pludder ventured out from time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, clambering a little way up and down the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jecting ridge of the mountain on which they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodged, and at length was able to assure his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions that they were on the northwestern face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mount Mitchell, the highest peak of the Appalach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian range. With the aid of his pocket aneroid, mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing allowance for the effect of the lifting of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole atmosphere by the flood, and summoning his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the locality--for he had explored, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">former years, all the mountains in this region--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at the conclusion that their place of refuge</seg><seg type="columnLine">was elevated about four thousand feet above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">former level of the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first their range of vision did not allow them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the condition of the valleys below them, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the water rose higher it gradually came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. It crept steadily up the slopes beneath, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already been stripped of their covering of trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vegetation by the force of the descending tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rents, until on the tenth day it had arrived almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">within reach. Since, as has just been said, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were four thousand feet above the former level of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea, it will be observed that the water must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have risen much more rapidly than the measure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of Cosmo Vera&amp;l indicated. Its average rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rise had been three instead of two inches per</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute, and the world was buried deeper than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo thought. The cause of his error will be ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The consternation of the little party when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus beheld the rapid drowning of the world below</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and saw no possibility of escape for them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves if the water continued to rise, as it evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do, cannot be depicted. Some of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven insane, and were with difficulty prevented</seg><seg type="columnLine">by those who retained their senses from throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves into the flood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pludder was the only one who maintained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">command over hia nerves, although he now at last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">believed in the nebula. He recognized that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no other possible explanation of the flood than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which Cosmo Vers&amp;l had offered long before it</seg><seg type="columnLine">began. In his secret heart he had no expectation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultimate escape, yet he was strong enough to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue to encourage his companions with hopes which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not himself entertain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When, after nightfall on the tenth day, the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to lap the lower parts of the aero, he was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point of persuading the party to clamber up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks in search of some shelter above, but as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out of the door &lt;1 * 'he cabin to reconnoiter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way, with the aid of. search-light which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had turned up along the rf&amp;ge, he was astonished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the rain rapidly diminishing in force; and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes later it ceased entirely, and the stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sudden cessation of the roar upon the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought everybody to his feet, and before Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor Pludder could communicate the good news all</seg><seg type="columnLine">were out under the sky, rejoicing and offering</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks for their delivery.

Did you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--" began Professor Pludder, taken aback by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the President's manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes," interrupted the President, "I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you would say. You didn't predict it because</seg><seg type="columnLine">you didn't see it coming. But why didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see it? What have we got observatories</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scientific societies for if they can't see or com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehend anything? Didn't Cosmo Vers&amp;l warn you?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Didn't he tell you where to look, and what to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">for? Didn't he show you his proofs?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We thought they were fallacious," stammered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Pludder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You thought they were fallacious--well, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fallacious? Does this spectacle of a nation</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned look 'fallacious' to you? Why didn't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">study the matter until you understood it? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you issue officially, and with my ignorant sanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion--may God forgive me for my blindness!--</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement after statement, assuring the people that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no danger--statements that were even</seg><seg type="columnLine">abusive towards him who alone should have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yet, as now appears, you knew nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. Millions upon millions have perished</seg><seg type="columnLine">through your obstinate opposition to the truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They might have saved themselves if they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been permitted to listen to the reiterated warnings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Cosmo Versal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, if I had only listened to him, and issued a</seg><seg type="columnLine">proclamation as he urged me to do! But I fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed your advice--you, in whose learning and pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended science I put blind faith! Abiel Pludder, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have upon my soul the weight that now</seg><seg type="columnLine">rests on yours for all the wealth that the lost world</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried down into its watery grave!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the President ceased speaking he turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sank upon a rock, pressing his hands upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat to suppress the sobs that broke forth despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">his efforts. His form shook like an aspen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The others crowded around excitedly, some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women in hysterics, and the men not knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to do or say. Professor Pludder, completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelmed by the suddenness and violence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack, went off by himself and sat down with hi3</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in his hands. After a while he arose and ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the President, who had not moved from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his place on the rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "George," he said--they had known each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">from boyhood--"I have made a terrible mistake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet I was not alone in it. The majority of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">colleagues were of my opinion, as were all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned societies of Europe. No such thing as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">watery nebula has ever been known to science. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inconceivable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some of your colleagues did not think so," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the President, looking up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they were not really convinced, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were aware that they were flying in the face of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">known laws."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am afraid," said the President dryly, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">science does not know all the laws of the universe</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I repeat," resumed Professor Pludder, "that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a fearful mistake. I have recognized the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late. I accept the awful burden of blame that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rests upon me, and I now wish to do everything in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my power to retrieve the consequences of my error."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The President arose and grasped the professor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forgive me, Abiel," he said, with emotion, "if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have spoken too much in the manner of a judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronouncing sentence. I was overwhelmed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the inconceivable calamity that has come</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us. I believe that you acted conscientiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECOND DELUGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">863</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and according to your best lights, and it is not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any mortal to judge you for an error thus commit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted. Let us think only of what we must do now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To that thought," responded Professor Pludder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning the pressure of the President's hand, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall devote all my energy. If I can save only this</seg><seg type="columnLine">little party I shall have done something in the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of atonement."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a deep humiliation for a man of Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor Pludder's proud and uncompromising nature to</seg><seg type="columnLine">confess that he had committed an error more fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful in its consequences than had ever been laid at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of a human being, but Cosmo Versal had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rightly judged him when he assured Joseph Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Pludder was morally sound, and, in a scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense, had the root of the matter in him. When his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental vision was clear, and unclouded by prejud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice, no one was more capable of high achievements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He quickly proved his capacity now, as he had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready proved it during the preceding adventures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the President's party. It was perfectly plain to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that their only chance was in getting to Colorado</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the earliest possible moment. The eastern part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the continent was hopelessly buried, and even on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high plains of the Middle West the fury of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">downpour might have spread universal disaster and</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed nearly all the vegetation; but, in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">event, it was there alone that the means of prolong-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing life could be sought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the problem squarely before his mind, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not long in finding a solution. His first step</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to make a thorough examination of the aero,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the hope that the damage that it had suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be reparable. He had all the tools that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be needed, as it was the custom for express aeros</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry a complete equipment for repairs; but un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunately one of the planes of the aero was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked beyond the possibility of repair. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon what delicate adjustments the safety of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern airship depended, and he did not dare un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dertake a voyage with a lame craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the idea occurred to him of trying to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">by water. The aero was a machine of the very lat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est type, and made of levium, consequently it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">float better than wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the opposition of ship-builders, incited and</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed by selfish interests, had not prevented the</seg><seg type="columnLine">employment of levium in marine construction, mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions of lives might now have been saved; but, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have before said, only a few experimental boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">of levium had been made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moreover, like all aeros intended for long trips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this one had what was called a "boat-bottom," in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to enable it to remain afloat with its burden</seg><seg type="columnLine">in case of an accidental fall into a large body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Pludder saw that this fact would enable him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn the wreck into a raft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would only be necessary to reshape the craft a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, and this was the easier because the aero was</seg><seg type="columnLine">put together in such a manner with screw-bolts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuts that it could be articulated or disarticulated as</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily as a watch. He had entire confidence in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineering skill, and in the ability of the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced men of the crew to aid him. He decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to employ the planes for outriders, which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve to increase the buoyancy and stability.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as he had completed his plan in his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">he explained his intentions to the President. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter and the other members of the party were at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first as much startled as surprised by the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">embarking on a voyage of eleven hundred miles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">so questionable a craft, but Professor Pludder as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured them that everything would go well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how about the propulsion?" asked Mr. Sam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. "You can't depend on the wind, and we've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sails."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have thought that all out," said Pludder. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall use the engine, and rearrange one of the aerial</seg><seg type="columnLine">screws so that it will serve for a propeller. I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect to get up any great speed, but if we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make only as much as two miles an hour we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive on the borders of the Colorado upland, five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet above sea, within about twenty-three</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. We may be able to do better than that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobody felt much confidence in this scheme ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept its inventor, but it appeared to be the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that could be done, and so they all fell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, each aiding as best he could, and after four</seg><seg type="columnLine">days of hard work the remarkable craft was ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for its adventurous voyage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Pludder had succeeded even better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he anticipated in transforming one of the aerial</seg><seg type="columnLine">screws into a propeller. Its original situation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">such that it naturally, as it were, fell into the prop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er place when the "hull" was partly submerged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, the blades being made of concentric rows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small plates, there was no difficulty in reducing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to a manageable size. The position of the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine did not need to be changed at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The "outriders," made up of the discarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes, promised to serve their purpose well, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin remained for a comfortable "deck-house." A</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudder had been contrived by an alteration of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one which had served for guiding the aero in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">flights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The water was close to their feet, and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no great difficulty in pushing the affair off the rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and getting it afloat. The women and children were</seg><seg type="columnLine">first put aboard, and then the men scrambled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, and Pludder set the motors going. The im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">provised propeller churned and spluttered, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did its work after a fashion, and, under a blue sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in dazzling sunshine, with a soft southerly breeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanning the strange sea that spread around them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they soon saw the bared rocks and deeply scored</seg><seg type="columnLine">flanks of Mount Mitchell receding behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were delighted to find that they were mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, at the very start, no less than three miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. Pludder clapped his hands and exclaimed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is capital! In but little over two weeks we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall be safe on the great plains. I have good hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">that many have survived there, and that we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a plenty of everything needed. With the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struments that were aboard the aero I can make</seg><seg type="columnLine">observations to determine our position, and I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">steer for the Pike's Peak region."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the party had become accustomed to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation, and had gained confidence in their craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">by observing how buoyantly it bore them, they be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came almost cheerful in their demeanor.

But I'd like to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know how you picked up the trail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fenner stepped over to the un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fortunate man. "I found it," he said,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">simply. "Why didn't you keep that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clothes line of yours indoors?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The man started, paled, then cried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in anguish, "My God, I never thought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of that.

Send him over, Chief,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and I'll tell you how the trick was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The man departed in charge of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two officers and Fenner tore the lid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">off the wooden box which the officers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had brought. He turned to me. "And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here, Bill," he said mockingly, "Is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">your educated harpoon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And he placed before my aston-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ished eyes an educated harpoon in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very truth. It was a small airplane,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wirelessly controlled, and its nose was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a long, bayonet-like knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Then the clothes line-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Was his aerial," cut in Joe, "and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the distance over which he wanted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to work he might just as well have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kept it inside. Just look this thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over carefully, old man. It's a shame</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that fellow stooped to murder. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has ideas worked out here that would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have retrieved his fallen fortunes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Notice that the airplane attachment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is really two complete planes. I've</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been wondering ever since I realized</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how the job was done; how under the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sun, after the knife was buried in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Corey's back, it was gotten out again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Now I see. When it came through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that window, the wings were right in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back of the knife and the propellers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in back of the wings with the rudder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the rear. Now notice the hinging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arrangement which folded the wings</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into a rudder and opened the rudder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out into a set of wings. The whole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">machine was reversed. Even an auxi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">liary propeller has been provided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And the lag of the knife in the wound</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">held the whole thing like a brake</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">just long enough for the propeller to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">get up speed before it gave and re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leased the machine. At that the fel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">low must have had an anxious minute</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">until he got the contrivance out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the window again. Only the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fact that it is a large room allowed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him to get the machine high enough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to clear that window sill on its way</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out. The selective control offers noth-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing new. The control points are con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stantly traversed by a revolving,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clock-work driven switch, and these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miniature vari-colored lights were the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tell-tales that told the distant pilot on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what contact point' the blade rested</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at any given minute. For instance,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when the light showed red, the rud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">der could be swung to the right; when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on green to the left. He followed its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">course through powerful night glasses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Take a look at .the coherer. You never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw the like before. I'll bet it's a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">peach. And this relay's weight or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rather, lack of it, would amaze you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But the masterpiece of the whole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing is the power plant. He must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have .worked for months on this model</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gasoline engine. I can imagine that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for its weight it produces an awful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">power, and it is absolutely silenced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There are at least a dozen new</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ideas involved here, and new applica-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions of hundreds of old ones. Under</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the spur of a great emotion--RE-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">VENGE--this man has produced a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing of terrible possibilities. You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have seen what happened to Corey."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Chief and I were gazing in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">awe at the little plane. I appreciated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the disposition of wing surface which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cut down the span sufficiently to al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">low it to pass through a window three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feet wide. And I realized the patient</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">paring away of a fraction of an ounce</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there that brought the total weight of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the machine low enough to allow of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the small supporting surface. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was not an unessential piece of ma-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terial to be found on the plane.
