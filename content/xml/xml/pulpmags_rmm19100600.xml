The tincture of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same blood that was in his own veins</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, to a slight extent, bestowed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him some of those traits, but he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in him they were less marked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His glance was diverted from time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.

He is well along toward eighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of age, but still active.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For fifty-three years he has been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of the Academy of Sciences; as</seg><seg type="columnLine">early as 1873 he was secretary of the so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciety, and now, for over thirty years, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been editor of its publications.

That it was neglected was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of constant sorrow during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater part of his life, and if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been a particularly ldng-lived man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would never have seen its final tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umph.

Something of the kind was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, a necessity on many of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller, crooked railroads in Europe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were narrow-gaged, winding as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">road full of sharp turns and of uneven</seg><seg type="columnLine">grade--very much, in fact, like our trol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley-1 ines. They required engines which</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make the sharp turns and coukl ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">just themselves to the sudden changes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">grade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mallet solved the problem by making</seg><seg type="columnLine">his engine with a high and a low-pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder, arranged on an entirely differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent system from the ordinary compound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The engines were necessarily light, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to overload the road-bed; and to get as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much force as possible in the drivers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a correspondingly large hauling pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er, he put all the weight on the drivers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The first engine which was made under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his directions was turned out by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creusot Works, in 18t5, for service on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bayonne and Biarritz Railway, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">road which was used only by tourists. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine was then constructed, the du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties of the engineer were rather compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated, and, largely on this account, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not made much use of on other roads</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the engineer's duties were modified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In those days Mallet, besides being</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary of the Academy of Sciences, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged in all sorts of engineering prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lems, and did not do much toward im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proving his engine until almost ten years</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, when the Decauville Engineering</seg><seg type="columnLine">Works, near Paris, called on him for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">design of an engine which could be used</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a portable railroad in military opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. So he took his former design in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and made several marked improve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, especially in the gear, reducing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer's duties practically to what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Pioneer of the Type.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This Mallet, made in the early eight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies, contained all the essentials of the.</seg><seg type="columnLine">biggest Mallets made to-day. Instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">having three or four drive-wheels pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled by each cylinder, it had only one ;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the design was the same. As in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latest improvements, the frame which car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried the rear drivers and the rear or high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure cylinder was rigidly attached to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boiler and made secure in the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">manner, and the forward drivers and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">low-pressure cylinders were on an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely separate frame, which was capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of turning independently of the rear dri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vers. George L. Fowler, a consulting</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer of New York, who saw the De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cauville portable engine in operation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">says it was in every way the same as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge mountain-climbers now in use on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the American railroads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It was the first Mallet I ever saw,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, in describing it, " and it was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">small you could almost jump over it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Except for the design, you could not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve it was any relation to the monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mallets they are turning out in this coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try nowadays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " The possibilities of the engine for</seg><seg type="columnLine">light work were apparent in an instant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I saw it in operation, it was haul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a heavy cannon over a roadway that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being laid but a few minutes ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. It was an uneven country, and, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the benefit of the test, they were building</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridges and laying track from material</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been torn up m the rear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotive as it passed. There were, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, only a few hundred yards of</seg><seg type="columnLine">track, but this was built so rapidly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little Mallet was able to keep going</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster than I could walk. It was ^ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely unsteady and uneven, as you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine, and the engine swayed back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth over all kinds of grades; but either</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forward or the rear wheels would al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways keep going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That capacity always to keep going is</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is making the Mallet what it is com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to mean to freight hauling on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American mountains. Besides having</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty per cent greater hauling power than</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ordinary engine of its own weight, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that the forward and the rear dri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vers are worked by separate cylinders on</seg><seg type="columnLine">separate trucks makes it capable of forg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its way steadily ahead, even if one</seg><seg type="columnLine">set of drivers loses its grip on the track.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Prophet Without Honor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Mallet built the portable engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had in mind its possibilities for heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ier work--such work, in fact, as it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been put to of recent years; but, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, he could not secure the attention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great railroad builders. It might do</seg><seg type="columnLine">well enough for portable railways and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">small, mountain-climbing roads, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">said; but when it came to real railroad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, they could see nothing in the Mallet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This attitude on the part of railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and the attempts Mallet made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break it down, give his career a particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly dramatic turn. And then, when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finally taken up by the railroads and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made use of, as might have been done</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago, the glory of it was almost lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. There was a time, when it first</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into prominence, when it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known by the names of two other men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was only because their names did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stick in the memory as well as Mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let's that he received the fame in the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Science has recognized the value of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">contribution to the world from the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning. He had no sooner placed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine in operation on the Bayonne and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Biarritz Railway than the Academy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sciences presented him ivith a gold medal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and placed him among the most impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant of its members. Then, when the De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cauville portable engine, which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed, proved a success, the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">Society for the Advancement of National</seg><seg type="columnLine">Industries conferred on him another gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">medal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Belated Honors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again, when the engine was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">into considerable use on the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroads of Europe, the same organiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, in 1895, gave him a second gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">medal for the same invention, apparent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly as a double honor to offset the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of credit. And even America has</seg><seg type="columnLine">given him scientific honors, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done in such an unostentatious way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one ever heard about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The honor in this case, however, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not given on account of the greatness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his achievement, but for a paper on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject of the Mallet engine. For this</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1908, presented him with the Elliott</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cresson medal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Little good these honors do him. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world at large, and particularly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad men, he is absolutely unknown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That even his name would be lost he</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared himself, and was put to the neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sity of writing to the leading engineer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing papers and correcting their mistake</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they fell into the habit of calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wonderful invention by the names of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, first, he had to get his engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized.

He sobered quite sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly. To be sure, he had Bullton pinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in such fashion that he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">110 danger whatever, for the switch was</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked at both ends ; but--the two trains!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His head cleared up curiously, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounded across the tracks to the station</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into the closet. He came out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">flags and bulging pockets, and ran up</seg><seg type="columnLine">track a little. He torpedoed the rails</seg><seg type="columnLine">very thoroughly, and planted red flags be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them. Pie raced back to the sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and halted a minute as he heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ravnor call.</seg><seg type="columnLine">GONE MAD WITH THE HEAT!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He answered.

The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnesses to the assault upon the ill-fated</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man were Erskine and McGrane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and these had made no report of the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, either to the elder Warrington or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More than this, would not Miss War-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rington at once give public expression to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her suspicion that her brother was killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Erskine and McGrane, who mistook</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for Montresor? A cold sweat broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">oiit on Erskine's forehead, and, tottering</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a drunkard, he returned to his seat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car.

The oily |</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">exudation which covers each hair is removed by the soap.
