In the two years during which Amazing Stories has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">published, thousands of readers have voiced the opinion that they would like to see it come out more fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently. Many readers wanted to see it a semi-monthly, and some even wanted it each week. These two</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestions, for production and publishing reasons, however, we have found to be an impractical solution to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the problem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Last summer we issued the Amazing Stories Annual, in which was featured "The Master Mind of Mars,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Edgar Rice Burroughs. This 50c Annual enjoyed an excellent reception, and brought forth many letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">from readers who enjoyed the book, asking us to publish such a book more frequently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The result is Amazing Stories Quarterly, the first issue of which you now have before you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The publication dates of Amazing Stories Quarterly will be as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          Winter issue.....January 20th</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">             Spring issue -----	April 20th</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         Summer issue.....July 20th</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fall issue......October 20th</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The publication of the Quarterly will not interfere with Amazing Stories Monthly Magazine, because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monthly is on the newsstands about the 5th of the month. It is believed that this staggering of the publica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion date will make the financial burden less heavy on Amazing Stories readers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The Quarterly performs one important duty; it enables us to publish many full length novels, which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you want, and which, if they were printed in the monthly, would take a good deal of time to publish. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been the rule of Amazing Stories Monthly to publish a full-size novel in three installments. That means,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it takes three months before it is completed. We have so many excellent full-length novels on hand which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to give our readers that we feel the Quarterly, supplementing the Monthly, will furnish an ideal arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Since the inception of Amazing Stories, a new literature, which we term "Scientifiction," has sprung up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are so many excellent short stories, as well as full-length novels, that are at our disposition now, that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very nature of things, it would take too long if all of them were to be published in the Monthly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It will furthermore be seen that the Quarterly contains exactly twice as much material as the Monthly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for that reason we come pretty close to the wish of so many of our readers--namely, to come out twice a</seg><seg type="columnLine">month. As far as material and stories are concerned, the Quarterly practically accomplishes this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Heeding the request of a large number of our readers, we have not included in this Quarterly, any stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">that appeared in the regular Monthly publication. All the stories in the Quarterly are brand new, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exception of "When the Sleeper Wakes," by H. G. Wells, and "The Gravity King," by Clelland J. Ball.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   We have had a great many requests to publish "When the Sleeper Wakes," and, since it is one of the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most books ever written by II. G. Wells, we are convinced that you will welcome its publication--especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the book is out of print, and is therefore very difficult to get at the present time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But the big story of the season is undoubtedly "The Moon of Doom," a new full-length novel published here</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time. This is a story that will arouse your interest and, we know, your approval. It is one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most exciting scientifiction stories we have printed in a year, and it ranks well with the best of such stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Now, after you have read the first issue of the Quarterly, we would very much like to have your reaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this publication. You will find a voting blank elsewhere in this magazine, which we would ask you to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">good enough to fill out.

It was known that the earth was speeding up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its axis. This alone was certain. As to the cause, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand and one theories had been projected from as</seg><seg type="columnLine">many sources. Observatories the world over were</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcasting reports so garbled that none could under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, and it wasn't the fault of the wireless, for static</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been eliminated many years ago. Astronomy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular was befogged. The world was speeding up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its axis. This epitomized the myriad suppositions so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as the man on the street could comprehend. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">would happen if the acceleration continued? "Chaos,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the answer. Here science had no doubt. Would it</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue? Science could not say. "We must first de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termine the causc of the phenomenon," was the some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what vacuous observation of Professor Josephus Sayre</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Yerkes Observatory, recognized as the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomer of the age and to whom the world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for an answer. And the renowned professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a berserker rage because of his impotence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the premises. Science itself was mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Other than the shortening of the days, little change</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been noted. The east still held the sun's wakening</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the west its repose, though there was a fraction less</seg><seg type="columnLine">of both daylight and darkness. The stars had lost none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their glory, and each maintained its niche. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the change was first</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed, astronomers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned their telescopes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon, which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting strangely for</seg><seg type="columnLine">years; but the satellite</seg><seg type="columnLine">still hung high in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens, apparently fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing on its usual orbit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though its motion, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of every other object</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the skies, seemed ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celerated as a result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth's new speed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was announced from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berlin Observatory, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, that Luna was shin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with unwonted bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liance. The bolometer</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that she was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flecting a little more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usual one-600,000th</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the sun's midday</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">light but it was agreed that this probably was due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that the atmosphere was at last practically free</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the first morning of the change, when it was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced that the sun had risen nearly three minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">late, an incredulous world was inclined to laugh--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">did laugh when it learned that the news came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burke Station in Colorado. For it was none other than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eccentric Professor Francis Burke, astronomer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hieroglyphist and orator, who had predicted that the tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great comet of 1999 would annihilate all life on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the globe. And the world laughed louder when it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered that the day was April First. "Capital!" it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed. "Professor Burke's Revenge!" "The Aristo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phanic Astronomer," jibed an editorial in the New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">Banner. "The Hoax of the Century!" screamed the Lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don Enquirer, while the sensational Chicago Dailytab</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued an extra heralding "Slip in Solar System!" in</seg><seg type="columnLine">red type. The sedate Washington Sentinel declared edi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torially that "the publicity-seeking perpetrator of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoax, who again bids fair to needlessly alarm the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be dealt with summarily in a manner fitting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormity of the intended jest, even though it is All</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fools' Day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the world, the work-a-day world, the joke-loving</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, had its little laugh and went about its affairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">as usual.

There had been no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wars for half a century. Though commercialism still</seg><seg type="columnLine">held sway and avarice was not extinct, men as a whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">were devoting more time to art and science, the burden</seg><seg type="columnLine">of industry having been lightened greatly by discoveries</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had existed only as far-fetched dreams a few dec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ades before. Though the greatest progress had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in inventions, the science of medicine--surgery</seg><seg type="columnLine">in particular--also had made enormous strides. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a true renaissance of learning, and knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the Golden Fleece. The work of harnessing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elements had been completed. There were few dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners left on the globe. Man was pushing ever onward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face toward the light. He was learning at last how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to face life, and there was no such thing as ''too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">love of living." Suicide was almost a thing of the past.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prisons were few and all but empty. There was work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all, but not too much of it. The dawn of the Golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Age was in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The greatest achievement of the century was the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lease and control of atomic energy, which was now doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world's work. The secret had been learned in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murden laboratories, in 1963. Except for lighting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">minor power purposes, electricity had been shelved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbo. Steam power was only a memory. Giant bird-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like atoplanes, made of duralumin, filled the air, carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on much of the world's travel and commerce. Ato-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobiles, both ponderous and small, constituted the traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem in the cities. Colossal atomotors turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels of industry. It was the age of the atom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The atoplanes were capable of indefinite flight, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftest of them could go two thousand miles an hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gargantuan atoliners made daily roundtrips from both</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe and America. Ships had practically vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">trom the seas, and railroads from the land. Atomobiles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding along hard-surfaced roads that radiated every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, transported passengers and some of the lighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight. Most of the passenger travel, however, was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, privately owned atoplanes which had a speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about five hundred miles an hour. Every city had its</seg><seg type="columnLine">atofield, and many of the older houses and nearly all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the office and industrial buildings had been covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with flat-topped structures affording landing stages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while all of the new buildings were being constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this plan. Elevators, opening on the roofs, provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent into the structures. Equipped with super-heli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">copters, the machines needed only their own displace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in which to land or rise. Atoheat supplied warmth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all buildings, while all but the smaller dwellings used</seg><seg type="columnLine">atolight for illumination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Atoplanes had carried man to every part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. Excursions in capsule-shaped atoliners to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poles were common. Explorers had made many remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able discoveries, chief among which was the finding of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperate valley between epic mountains and glaciers</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred miles from the North Pole which Amund-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sen, on his flight across the pole to Alaska in 1926, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely missed. This valley, earth's newest frontier, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become peopled by the adventurous from all climes. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was named Rogeriand for its discoverer, an American,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its chief city was Boreas. Fifty miles long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly as wide, the fertile rift now had a population of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly half a million. Many strange flora and fauna</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been found there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The principal metamorphosis caused by the develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the atoplane had to do with the redistribution</seg><seg type="columnLine">of population in nearly all countries. The population</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the large cities had decreased in keeping with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth of suburban life, while new communities had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprung up like mushrooms, especially on the sides of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains, the residents flying to and from the cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were still the centers of industry, education, sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, art and amusement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another, and probably the most important effect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the utilization of atomic energy was the definite out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawing of war. With universal energy at their disposal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nations realized that war would mean universal</seg><seg type="columnLine">suicide. Twenty years since, the principal governments</seg><seg type="columnLine">had adopted the Perpetual Peace Pact, for mutual pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection. All armies and navies had been abolished and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting machinery scrapped, only a few relics having</seg><seg type="columnLine">been saved for museums. With the fear of war elimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated, the world had turned its energy toward building</seg><seg type="columnLine">a real civilization, and Utopia seemed just around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. Nearly every country was a republic. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Britain had given up her king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The world's news was disseminated almost entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">by radio. With static eliminated, nearly every home had</seg><seg type="columnLine">both receiving and sending sets. Telephone and tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph had disappeared. Newspapers were published</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in the large cities, and their news contents were</seg><seg type="columnLine">confined mainly to major items which, in the old days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were called bulletins. Their "make-up" was given over</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely to editorials and articles written by leading edu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cators, scientists and fictionists, and to advertisements.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through a recent invention by which radiograms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">typed directly on the cylinders of the presses, almost im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediate dissemination of the news was effected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Astronomy was perhaps the most popular science. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flectors with 480-inch specula had been perfected, bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thousands of new stars to view. Every great obser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vatory was a Mecca for a star-gazing populace. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudiments of astronomy were taught even in the primary</seg><seg type="columnLine">schools and youth was exhibiting keen interest in it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the younger generation of three-quarters of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">century before had been the most rabid radio devotees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The powerful reflectors had brought much new plane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary knowledge. It was known that the markings on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars really were cleverly engineered canals, as sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested by Professor Percival Lowell many years before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that life on the arid globe had been extinct prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably 300,000 years. That Venus turned on its axis and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that conditions there were favorable to life in many</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms was also revealed. The theory that Saturn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty rings were composed of huge encircling meteor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ites, some nearly as large as planetoids, had also been</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved. A tenth moon had been found in attendance</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Giant Jupiter. Another discovery was that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midget Mercury turned both faces to the sun. The most</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant planets, Uranus and Neptune, were shown to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds of ice, whereas it had been believed they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres of fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the discovery that occasioned most interest was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made by Professor Sherard, whose invention, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescopic attachment that concentrated the magnitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the reflectors, permitting a much more minute study</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a small area, had disclosed strange writings on Mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hadley, one of the moon's largest mountains. Bizarre</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures, some a hundred feet high, and weird lettering</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no one had been able to decipher, were now visible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It %vas also thought that mathematical calculations had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been carved on the almost perpendicular cliff, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sherard concentrator was not powerful enough to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">this clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That the chiseling was the work of a vanished race,</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomy was certain. The most powerful telescopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON OF DOOM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the satellite within ten miles, as it were, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its surface was shown to be a fantastic stretch of moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, craters and plains with an absolute absence of air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and water. The origin of the craters was still a mystery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as was the nature of the strange "white rays" which</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiated from a few of the principal craters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The advance of medical science, in the year 2009, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to reach a fountain of youth, but had conquered</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly every disease. The span of human life had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthened many years and there were thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">centenarians. Men were at last learning how to delay</seg><seg type="columnLine">death by correct living. The Great White Plague was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a memory. Cancer had been the last terror to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanquished. Prodigious progress had been made in sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gery. No longer were the maimed and the blind seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the streets. New limbs were grafted on the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membei-ed; the eyes of the newly dead were made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">function in the sockets of the sightless, and nearly every</seg><seg type="columnLine">other lost or worn out part of the body, heart and brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">excepted, was similarly replaced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poverty, the mocker of civilization, had vanished. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">conflict of labor and capital was no more. Criminals</seg><seg type="columnLine">were treated for their sick minds and capital punishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been outlawed everywhere. Depravity was regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">as insanity. The law of cause and effect was universally</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mankind was growing up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Revenge of the Atom</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PROFESSOR SHERARD, in his theory as to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the Great Change, which was broadcast</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere and published in full in every paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blamed the release of atomic energy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Atoms, he explained, were the source of the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetism as well as its energy. The wholesale use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new power, through the blasting of the atom, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">disrupted the finely wrought balance between the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the moon. The residue of released energy, instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of returning to its natural state or assuming another</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, had gradually enveloped the planet with an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible but powerful magnetic jacket several miles thick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He cited the enormous increase in the number of meteor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ites that had entered the earth's atmosphere in recent</seg><seg type="columnLine">years as substantiation of his theory. This new mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netism, distinct from the earth's gravitational force,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had at last overcome the planet's tidal reaction on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, which had been driving the satellite farther into</seg><seg type="columnLine">space since the time it became liberated from the nascent</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, and was pulling it back, causing the earth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotate faster each mile the moon advanced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only hope, he said, was that the immediate cessa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of atomic energy production might halt the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gradually restore the balance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But I see little hope even if this is done," he declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismally. "The pull of the earth has already counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted the push of the tides and it is probable that nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can do will repair the break. It seems that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon must continue its earthward course until the finish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is barely possible, however, that the tides themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">may eventually drive it back, or that science will find</seg><seg type="columnLine">some way to neutralize or vitiate the atomic envelope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the latter case, the moon would halt and gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">recede again, due to the tidal reaction. But such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility seems very remote. The new magnetism is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ghost of the atom, as it were, and is earthbound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding the globe like a spectral sheet that cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">be unwound. Extensive research in my laboratory has</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to reveal a way by which its influence can be coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teracted. All we can do is to return to the use of elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity or some other non-magnetizing agent. The pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duction of atomic energy should be stopped summarily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the world over, and if that fails to undo the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Change, the earth must pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The moon is now advancing at a rate of about a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand miles a day. It is now about 235,000 miles away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If its present speed is maintained it will be, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred and thirty-five days before it reaches the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. But its speed will undoubtedly increase each</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile, just as a needle moves faster as it nears a magnet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is known that a needle fairly jumps to the magnet</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a certain point of attraction is reached, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is possible that the moon will do likewise when it at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains a certain proximity to the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Science now knows that the moon was once a part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth and that it was cast off, as from a break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flywheel, when the molten planet was rotating at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inconceivable speed. And then, after the earth broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the centrifugal strain and the moon became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">separate body, there was a time when the two spinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres almost grazed. At this time, the earth was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volving in about three hours and the moon shared its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotation. But the reaction of the tides--and they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been immense--caused the moon to recede farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">and farther and the earth to slow down correspondingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the days becoming longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the earth and the moon were virtually in</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact, the day was about three hours long. Up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time of the Great Change the moon's average distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about 240,000 miles and the day twenty-four hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. Taking the average distance as a working basis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this shows that for every 11,428 4-7 miles the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">receded, the day became an hour longer. It is logical</seg><seg type="columnLine">to presume that the situation will be reversed as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon advances--that one hour will be clipped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-four for every 11,428 4-7 miles until, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon has come twenty-one times this distance, it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">very nearly, if not actually, touch the earth, which will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be rotating in about three hours, the satellite moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. But there is a possibility, as previously ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained, that the moon will do more than merely graze</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth.

He had taken her and her mother to the seashore</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a Sunday afternoon outing. A severe storm came</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and during the darkness that preceded the gale's fury,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl, clad in her bathing suit, disappeared. Half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour later, while the storm wa3 at its ugliest pitch, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found her poised tip-toe atop a beetling crag at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean's edge, facing the terrible splendor of the light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning-lashed sky and the storm-tossed sea, her arms out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched as if to embrace the gale and become a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, a look of mingled defiance and happiness on her face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood there fully a minute, watching the spray dash</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over her lissom form and play with her soft brown hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, God, how wonderful!" the child exclaimed as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took her by the arm.

Against the time when the glacial weather</seg><seg type="columnLine">would envelope the cliffs in a shroud of ice, they soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned their tents and other temporary dwellings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dug deep into the mountainsides where they fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned large rooms and passageways, using atorays to</seg><seg type="columnLine">melt the solid rock.

As a precaution against the time when</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthquakes would threaten their dug-outs, forcing them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to flee to other peaks, they kept their atoplanes ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instant service, storing them in specially tunneled</seg><seg type="columnLine">"garages."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These arrangements, though entailing many hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, had staved off actual suffering for many weeks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the Great Change was not to be outdone.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night there seemed to be nothing but moon--and each</seg><seg type="columnLine">night the moon waxed larger, more malevolent. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird effect was the frequency of eclipses on both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth and moon, caused by the nearness of the two bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The satellite had lost all likeness to the golden disk</seg><seg type="columnLine">that once adorned the canopy. The change was as start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling as complete. Its "human face" had long since dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, and in its stead loomed a terrible topography</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gaunt mountains, yawing chasms and pock-marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">plains, all plainly discernible without the aid of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope. The craters of Copernicus, Clavius and Tycho</seg><seg type="columnLine">were especially conspicuous, and from the latter ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange white rays stretched uniformly in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction like streamers of marble expertly designed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The long swath of the Alpine Valley was another prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inent feature, while the Apennines and the Carpathian</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountains were so distinct that their jagged peaks could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen protruding in serrate outline from the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the satellite, which now appeared slightly convex.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As its orbit narrowed, the moon's librations had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come more pronounced and its north and south caps were</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined in turn more and more toward the earth. Time</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the satellite also had been disrupted, as it were, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">periods of day and night having decreased. It had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased its distance from the earth by approximately</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">160,000	miles since the beginning of its earthward jaunt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the corresponding shrinkage of its orbit had reduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">its "fortnights" of light and darkness to less than five</seg><seg type="columnLine">days each.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poets had always been at odds as to the color of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, some singing its silvery light and others its</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden luster. But now the orb was neither argentine</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor aureate. Its general color was that of burnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">brass as seen under a red light. Its radiance was dim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming rapidly, and it was strange to note that the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows of its mountains were becoming less .distinct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The change was even more remarkable as seen through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the observatory telescopes. Every feature was brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">within touching distance, it seemed, by the giant lenses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Astronomers now saw the wrinkled countenance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon almost as plainly as if they were on its very sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and its color, under the glasses, was dull gray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The proximity of the satellite had brought much new</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of its physical characteristics. Its mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">were shown to be more complex than had been thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and science now was certain that the Alpine Valley was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result of the contact of some wandering celestial</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. Its craters appeared to be the remains or bases</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gigantic bubbles raised by volcanic gasses when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe was molten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no sign of life on the sphere, but evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it once had been peopled was indisputable. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery that received most attention was that a Gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gantuan gargoyle figure was carved on the side of Mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hadley near the strange markings which Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burke had discovered. Its features were too indistinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">to provide a clear picture. As for the hieroglyphics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">science now was certain that they contained mathemat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical calculations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bolometers showed that the moon's temperature</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not nearly so low has had been reckoned, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">its surface was reflecting an appreciable amount of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's heat--about one 400,000th part. Whether this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact was occasioned by the globe's nearness to the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a matter of conjecture. During the moon's Stygian</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, however, the temperature fell to nearly one hun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and fifty degrees below zero, but this was not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold as science had estimated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professors Sherard and Burke, in their atoheated ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servatory, were spending nearly every available minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">studying the satellite, and Mildred Reamer was fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enrapt. The three pondered long over the hieroglyph-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ics on Mount Hadley seeking a deciphering clue which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ernest believed, lay in the mathematical arrangements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would like to know their significance, even at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">late day in the world's life," he told Mildred one night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I believe they are records left by a dying race.

It must be that its outlines are not as con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spicuous as those of the hieroglyphics. But I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">swear now that it has two great glittering eyes. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, though, that no other signs of lunar civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion can be detected. The Moonman must have lived in</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses of some sort and built temples to their deities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seems that such structures should still be in a fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of preservation, due to the absence of air."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, if such ruins exist, they must be on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the moon," Mildred said as she took her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the reflector. "And of course that's not prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, as the temperature on the other side must be in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceivably low. The other side of the moon! How I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should like to explore it! And something tells me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shall, some day. The moon has always called to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now, when it is so close that it seems I could reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and touch it, I am tempted to stretch out my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cry for it, as they tell me I did when I was a baby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seems to be drawing me toward it even as it is pull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the tides.

An undercurrent of emotion</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed Ernest and Mildred, it was true, but they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been more or less than human had they failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">react in some degree to the seriousness of the occasion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most momentous of their lives. They were preparing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dare the very heavens, to take the chance of chances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Born of the planet Earth, they were as truly a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as the hills and the seas, and their love for it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger thi'n they had realized. Somewhere in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner minds throbbed the thought that they were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitting a sacrilege in not resigning themselves to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">common fate.

"His own country always</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems fairest to him in the parting hour, and he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes conscious of a desire to remain, even though re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining means oppression.

Life here is but moonshine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway, and the moon can have no moonshine.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">discoverer of the Great Change was fast asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ernest's calculation as to the retarded speed of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane proved nearly correct. With the motors going</seg><seg type="columnLine">full speed, the speedometer showed almost eight hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mildred watched the vanishing, dwindling planet"as</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as there was a ray of light. At a distance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five hundred miles, Terra was seen in its natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">convexity, and loomed as a huge expanse of opal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sapphire. And half an hour later, in the red glory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunset, it was like a jewel in the ring of Cosmos, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">indescribably beautiful fusion of topaz and bloodstone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the purple night and the planet Earth was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swathed in darkness save for the faintly reflected light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the moon which revealed it as a disk of shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">green and tarnished gold whose colossal bulk, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly phosphorescent sea suspended in space, all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the picture below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Mildred was drinking in the beauty of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene, Ernest called to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Move forward and look at the stars," he said. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't see them well back there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking over his shoulder, through the glass shield,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl beheld a panorama of celestial splendor that</seg><seg type="columnLine">entranced her, held her spellbound in silent ecstacy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Directly before her lay the great face of the burnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, its pock-marked countenance more vivid than she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever seen it with unaided vision. And on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, and above and below, stretched a wilderness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazzling points of light against a Stygian background.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The stars!" she cried at last. "I had no idea they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be so brilliant. I thought the air which surrounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">us would dim them, as on Earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And so did I until a little while ago," Ernest said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can't you guess what their radiance signifies?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't believe I can," she replied after a minute's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pondering. "Please tell me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It means that we are only a short distance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether of space--that the air path is attenuated toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center, as if it were traveling through a tapering</seg><seg type="columnLine">funnel as big as the earth at one end and as the moon at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. The narrowest part will be much nearer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon than the earth, of course, because the moon is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller body. Whether this means that the air is</seg><seg type="columnLine">denser or thinner as the tapering proceeds remains to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen, but I believe it will be thicker and that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed will increase until we have passed the 'neck.' We</seg><seg type="columnLine">are now making eight hundred miles an hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what if we should jut out of the unseen path</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it contracts?" Mildred asked anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would be the end of our adventure. Our ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">might fall back into the air, but there would be little</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to right it, and it would fall back to Earth like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a plummet. I'm afraid that that will be the fate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many who come after us--those who will not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the brilliance of the stars portends danger ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is why I am pointing The Pioneer directly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When is Professor Burke to take the wheel?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As soon as he wakes.

Mildred cried as she espied the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet far out in space. "It looks like a small moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and the planets will appear much larger as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the walls of ether.

"How can one sleep in a time like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this? I was never so awake, so alive. I feel that I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be able to sleep until the moon is ours. I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay awake until the next darkness, at least."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There won't be so much darkness after a while,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ernest reminded. "The night that surrounds us now</seg><seg type="columnLine">is caused by the shadow of the earth, and we will soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">be so far out in space that the shadow will no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross our path except when the planet is directly between</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and the sun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And we will then see the shadow as a lunar eclipse!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mildred rejoiced. "Our voyage is so wonderful that I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost sorry it must end.

The moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only twenty-five thousand miles away. Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Burke had roused from his slumbers long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to act as pilot for eight hours, and had then</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed his nap. Mildred had retired to her cabin for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her first sleep 6ince leaving Earth. Ernest Sherard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain that they were nearing the point of greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger, was pointing The Pioneer directly at the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater of Reaumur, a central cavity on the satellite's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitted face. He was to call Mildred when they neared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrowest part of the unseen road, the boundaries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which would be only a few miles away, so that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">might see the stars and planets at their brightest, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glory of the sun's corona.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Burke had failed to show any mark of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling while viewing the stars from the cockpit, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he been lifted to the seventh heaven of ecstacy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would not have admitted it. He regarded a display</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the emotions--the militant urge excepted--as an adver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tisement of tempermental instability, just as he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered it a sign of mental weakness to fully agree with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone. He conceded, however, that the panorama was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of transcendent beauty, but contended that he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see anything wonderful about it. "We expected it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look like that, you know," he told Mildred. "We know</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause, and it would be wonderful only if the cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to produce the effect."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Ernest resumed command the plane was making</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand miles an hour.

It was then Ernest</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to Mildred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are nearing the crucial stage," he informed. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">air is nearly as dense as it used to be on Earth, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe it will be even denser at the narrowest point, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which event our ship will exceed any speed it has ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">attained."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How far are we from the moon?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hardly more than twenty-four thousand miles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twenty-four more hours should see our journey ended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I believe we will average about a thousand miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour the rest of the way. We will probably average</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five hundred when we are in the 'neck' of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, and more than a thousand for several more hours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then, when the air is again so rarefied that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed is materially diminished, we will probably have</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a point where the moon's attraction is greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the earth's. This will necessitate retarding our</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane--like applying the brakes of an automobile in</seg><seg type="columnLine">going down hill. We will then have to spiral down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, that means we must spiral for thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles, does it not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, eight or nine thousand, I should say. I calcu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late we will be that close to the moon when the gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional change occurs. Luna, we must remember, also</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been advancing to meet us, though her speed has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduced greatly since we left Earth. The two spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">then were separated by approximately fifty-eight thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand miles.

He's certain to find something wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was neither night nor day twenty-four thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles out in space. A ghostly twilight unlike any the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthians had ever seen filled the airpath--a twilight</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hinted of green. Mildred had first noticed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange dusk several thousand miles back and had called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ernest's attention to it, and he had told her that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would probably discover the cause the next time she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked through the rear observation window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One glance through the glass solved the mystery for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mildred. "Eureka!" she exclaimed, her voice exulting</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the speaking tube. "It's the earthlight, Ernest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our world is now a great ball of shimmering green. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance seems phosphorescent. All of the globe is vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible, but I think I see the shadow of night beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">encroach on one side of it--the eastern side, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to say, but I've lost all sense of direction up here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the earth were not covered with ice and water I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure I could see the continents in bas-relief. I wish you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see it, Ernest. It is more beautiful than I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed it could be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, that confirms the popular scientific theory as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the planetary color of Terra," Ernest responded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Personally, however, I believed its luminosity, viewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from afar, could have been blue as well as green. Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Burke always insisted Earth was a yellow planet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wonder what he'll say about it now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has already said it," Mildred laughed. "I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him earth-gazing when I came to wake him, and hia</seg><seg type="columnLine">only remark was that he had just made the astounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery that the earth, not the moon, was made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">green cheese."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and I still contend it's yellow, if viewed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sufficient distance," Burke's voice triumphed behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. "Disprove that if you can. And I also claim</seg><seg type="columnLine">that pretty moon of yours is likely to turn on its axis</seg><seg type="columnLine">before long, though I don't think Ernest has mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that phase of the situation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mildred continued to watch the globe until the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">fringe had climbed over its edge and blotted out a fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. It was then that she saw for the first time, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gibbous Earth. So rapidly was the planet revolving she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the movement of the shadow across its face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She told Ernest of this, and the young lunarian's guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that the world was revolving in slightly less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it's certain the waves have conquered everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the highest peaks," he added. "I wonder if there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spark of life left. The temperature must be almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as low as up here. Let us hope that every atoplane has</seg><seg type="columnLine">already left the planet. Some of them may be only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles behind us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How cold is it outside?" Mildred asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About ninety below zero. The propeller blades are</seg><seg type="columnLine">glazed with two inches of ice. It was a hundred below</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes ago, and the rise is proof that the air is</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting much denser. Our ship is now making the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">precedented speed of twenty-three hundred miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, and I guess this means we are near the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothingness. Come and look at the sun now, Mildred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bring the Professor with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next hour was, to them, the climax of eternity</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, the one hour into which was crowded all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty and splendor spun of creation's warp and woof</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . The pristine glory of the universe resplendent in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinitude of ether . . . Beauty inconceivable, ineffable</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . Beauty so exquisite that it sang of pain . . . Beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">that subdued, demanding silence . . .

"It's newly acquired atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">will dim the stars and hide the corona. We may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing their real glory for the last time, for the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">path is already widening. And by the way--we'd better</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepare for the gravitational change. We'll feel as</seg><seg type="columnLine">light as birds when we come under the moon's influence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours later they were beyond the narrow pale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gorgeous extravaganza of the heavens fading behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Their aerial argosy's speed had diminished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventeen hundred miles an hour. Before them, less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than twenty thousand miles, lay the mystic mountains of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was full daylight 011 Luna, but the brightness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily giving way to a monochrome of gray. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming paradox, Ernest explained, was due to the moon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">borrowed brilliance disappearing as its natural dullness</seg><seg type="columnLine">hove into view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mountains were only faintly discernible in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray blur, and the craters had vanished entirely. Er-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nest foresaw little danger on this score, however, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the airpath was now several hundred miles wide, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitting greater latitude in guiding the plane. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater of Reaumur and other moonmarks would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear, he knew, when near enough to be distinguished</seg><seg type="columnLine">without the aid of the lost light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they were studying the lunar dimness, another</seg><seg type="columnLine">transition occurred. A sable circle began to edge its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way over the great ashen ball, turning it into a globe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ebony. It was the shadow of Terra. They had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">many eclipses since the Great Change, but none so spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacular, so bizarre as this. They watched it until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon was entirely darkened, and then until the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness moved on into space, leaving Luna to her weird,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wan sombreness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Came the hour when the pull of the moon was stronger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that of the earth. The physical effects of the change</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not so marked as they had anticipated. They first</seg><seg type="columnLine">became aware that they were descending instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing when they were about nine thousand miles from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their destination and the earth was some forty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles above them. In a little while The Pioneer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was descending in vast, but ever-narrowing circles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, with only three thousand miles to go, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the mountain ranges in bold relief, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">craters appeared as shell-holes on some ancient battle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field of Earth. The moon was now the color of gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">weathered sandstone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down they went until the darkest parts of the satel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lite assumed the color of slate. The gliding process was</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming complicated because of the moon's weak tug,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ernest had to keep the motors in operation most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the time. Down, until they were below the level of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the higher peaks. Down, until the crevices and craters</seg><seg type="columnLine">yawned in their very faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amid a cloud of lunar dust, they landed on a level</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch about a mile from Reaumur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVI</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Pit of Reaumur</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEIR epochal journey ended, there remained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility that it had been made in vain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Pioneer's altimeter told them that the moon's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere was as dense as that which they had left on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, and the thermometer revealed that the tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture was twenty degrees above zero, but whether or not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long lunar nights would bring the cold of death was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a question that the darkness only could answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accomplishers of the most perilous feat mortals ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted, they felt the surge of fear now that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voyage was over--the fear of the unknown that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heritage of life itself. The stretch of moonland around</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, grotesque and uninviting, seemed to whisper mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teries dark as the Apennines that loomed on the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon. Reason told them there was nothing to fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but imagination hinted of forces subtle and sinister.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They found it difficult to believe they were actually on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon. The Great Change, the flight through space</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the very moon itself now seemed a fantastic dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a word was uttered for several minutes. Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Burke's piping voice was the first to pierce the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunar silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's get out of here," he suggested. "I feel as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had been living in one of those ancient New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment houses. I want to see what is inside that</seg><seg type="columnLine">small crater over there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And who shall be the first Earthian to set foot on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon?" Ernest queried. "If the Professor doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">care, I move that Mildred be given that honor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," Burke acquiesced.

Professor Burke asked sharply. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane would get us there in a jiffy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, but I think the walk will do us good.

"I think the Professor sadly mistrusts</seg><seg type="columnLine">his underpinning," he whispered to Mildred as they be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan their hike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the lunar soil was indeed a substance worthy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific study. It was like no soil they had known on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth. The color of salt and even more finely grained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed to be a mixture of disintegrated rock, pul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verized marble and silica. It glittered in the sunlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave under foot like dry snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Its latter quality, hinting of quicksand, tended to abet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect of the moon's puny gravitation, and Ernest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mildred soon learned that walking was a more com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicated matter than their first brief efforts had indicated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They found it necessary to hold hands most of the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their tedious journey consumed the better part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the reward was worth the effort. Upon nearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ramparts of Reaumur, which rose about four hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, they made the first surprising discovery of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunar exploration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mysterious white rays they had seen through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope were explained!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leading into the pit of Reaumur from every direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">like spokes into a hub, the rays were nothing less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep ditches, waterways dug by the Moonmen of long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. Their purpose was obvious; they had been made</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hoard the rainfall of a drying world by carrying it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the natural reservoirs of the craters through small</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings bored through the walls. The greater length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the channels was covered with the strange sand, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough was visible, at the base of Reaumur's ramparts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell their history. And when Ernest, using his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a shovel, removed some of the sand from the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one of the ditches at a point some distance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater, he learned why the trenches around the larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">pits had appeared white through the telescope. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower walls and bottoms were lined with a material that</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembled highly polished marble!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The openings in the sides of the crater were too small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ramparts too high, to permit exploration of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably every sizable crater tells the same story--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the story of a dying race," Ernest remarked as he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mildred turned to go. There was a touch of sadness in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice. "It must have taken the Moonmen many</seg><seg type="columnLine">years--centuries, perhaps--to convert the craters into</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisterns. The Martians, science believes, once engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a similar work--digging canals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why is it," Mildred asked, "that the channels of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the principal craters are white for miles while those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reaumur are almost hidden by sand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The only supposition is that the craters of Tycho,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Copernicus and Kepler, whose rays are most pronounced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are in regions comparatively free of this substance we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have called sand. This must be particularly true of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kepler, which is located on one of the dark plains which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the early astronomers called seas. I believe we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn much more when we visit the larger pits where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waterways through the walls may be large enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us to go through and view the interior. Reaumur is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the minor craters--not more than ten miles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Which region do you intend to explore first?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You should have guessed that--Mount Hadley, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. It is possible that we can decipher the hiero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glyphics and learn more than we could by years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploration."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beginning their trek back to the plane, they saw Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Burke, a pygmy in the distance, walking in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow circle and flapping his arms for balance, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a penguin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Professor will probably tell us that he has reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the astounding conclusion that snowshoes would facili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate our peripatetic progress," Ernest predicated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I'll agree with him," Mildred laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the Professor's greeting contained not a perambu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">latory word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have discovered that this sand is exactly the color</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dirty salt," he said, "and I don't believe it would grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">even cactus."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mount Hadley</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">660HALL we start now, or get some sleep first?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ernest asked i^ter telling Professor Burke of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan to visit Mount Hadley.

Put us on the farthest star</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we'd be earthbound still. Therefore, let us sleep."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ernest also yawned. "I guess I am about 'all in,' but</seg><seg type="columnLine">me mustn't lose much time in sleep just now. The lunar</seg><seg type="columnLine">night will begin in less than twenty hours, and I want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Mount Hadley first.

Mildred</seg><seg type="columnLine">queried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Without figuring it out, about thirty hours, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">say.

Modeled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">bold relief, it seemed a nightmare, something turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. Though its features were plainly delineated, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a suggestion of shapelessness throughout. It might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been an evil genie from Aladdin's mystic lamp, or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape from the nethermost pit. Its head--if head it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be called--was larger than its body. By far the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most conspicuous feature was its eyes--great protruding</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiant balls set high on a bulging brow and topped by</seg><seg type="columnLine">what seemed to be spreading antennae. The orbs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least fifteen feet in diameter, were faceted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkled like a thousand diamonds. Its nose was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubby porcine snout; its mouth an inordinate, many-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanged, flabby-lipped gash reaching almost from ear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear and twisted in a Gargoyle grin, half smile, half leer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its ears were huge fantastic appendages extending from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jowl below the level of the nose-tip. The lower part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the head, like the upper, was turgid, giving it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contour of the figure 8, of a plump peanut, rather. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Thing's body was bulbous and striped, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous onion. Two massive, triple-jointed arms, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembling in structure the anterior legs of an insect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">protruded from each shoulder, the lower pair being</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded across its pot belly while the other two, extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of the body, clutched a colossal block of stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was suspended menacingly over a huge bowl held</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lap, the two objects forming a sort of mortar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pestle arrangement. The bowl was gripped between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrosity's stump legs, which corresponded in number</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its arms and were likewise triple-jointed. But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracted the Earthians most, next to the fetish's blaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing eyes, were its hands and feet which, though scaly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were human in every other respect, even to the nails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Thing was naked, sexless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In striking contrast to the monster's uncouth pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portions and terrible aspect, but scarcely less bizarre,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the figures of its worshippers. The kneeling Moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, some of whose faces were turned from the god, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">half insect, half human. Their heads, prodigious and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost perfectly oval, were balanced on long and ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surdly small necks. Their eyes mere specks under</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetling brows and, like the idol's, were surmounted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">antennae. Their noses were short and flat, with enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous nostrils. Their ears, disproportionately large,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been huge copies of cockleshells, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">radially ribbed inside and notched on the rims. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouths were quite small and rather puckered, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncomely. All told, their faces, while amazingly grotes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">que, were not forbidding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bodies of the Moonmen also were egg-shaped, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">more tapering than their heads. The circumference of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their chests must have been thrice that of their wasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like waists, from which suspended short leather-like gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. Of arms and legs there were only two of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they, like the idol's, were triple-jointed, and exceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly long and slender ending, like the god's, in hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet of human shape. Though formed of cement like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idol, there was a suggestion of fragility, of pulpiness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost, about the figures.

On either side of the idol some distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, stood groups of erect Moonmen, some of them en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">*	This is the edible fruit of a passion flower of the Southern U.

The soldiers also wore helmets</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely like those of Terra's ancient knights, barring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the holes through which antennae protruded. Other fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures--presumably female--wore umbrella-shaped head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gear and carried baskets and urns. A few naked chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren were represented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The animals--if animals they were--were even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect-like than the Lunarians. Though varying in size</seg><seg type="columnLine">and structure, the bodies of all were oval and tail-less,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads mere knobs. Professor Burke said they</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like fat sausages with knots on one end. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beasts were quadrupeds, others hexapods. Among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the six-legged were some gigantic things formed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleas, except that their bodies were not laterally com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed. Some of them were hitched to clumsy two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled chariots and carts. There also were some</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloated creatures with udders and teats, some small</seg><seg type="columnLine">quadrupeds held in leash like dogs, and several other</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapes that could be likened to nothing the Earthians</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen on their globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hundreds of lunar objects also were represented.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were pictures of mountains, craters, caves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses that resembled adobe structures, and one of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">imposing, many-windowed building that must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a temple. A series of horizontal wavy lines was taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Earthians to represent water, and an arch, sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounting perpendicular wavy streaks, looked like a rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture drawn by a prehistoric artist of the mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. And there was the likeness of the mother world</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself--two circles in which the outlines of Earth's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinents had been carved. The hemispheres were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily distinguishable, however. The eastern con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinents were not quite in keeping with those known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earthians, the western hemisphere showed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">North America was joined to Asia by a narrow neck of</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, and between the Americas and Europe, nearer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter continent and embraced in the circle showing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western half of the globe, lay a vast body of land which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earthians had never seen, but which they knew to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be Atlantis. The outlines of nearly all the continents</seg><seg type="columnLine">were slightly different from those with which they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar. It was clear that great geologic changes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken place since the maps were drawn. For instance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Lunarians had the continent of Asia extending clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Borneo and including the Philippine Islands--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was "The Wallace Line"* between Asia and Aus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tralia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hieroglyphics stretched in every direction, line on</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. Some of them were carved above the idol and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">both sides of the erect Moonmen, and on the sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chariots and carts. Many of the characters were more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a hundred feet high; others, particularly those on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vehicles, relatively small.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The arithmetical arrangements near the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain were easily comprehensible. Their simplicity</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed striking proof that the Lunarians knew Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inhabited and had tried to make their meaning in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligible to the planetarians. First, there was a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight mark, a dash and then another mark, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a symbol for the figure 1. This system continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the figure 8, each total being accompanied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">its symbol, then advanced into octuplication, and later</seg><seg type="columnLine">into mathematical characters that the Earthians could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not decipher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The carvings naturally interested Ernest and Mildred</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than anything they had seen since reaching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satellite. Ernest now knew why he had been unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the great idol from Earth: its cement composition</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost as dark as its slaty background.

A tall, well-poised man of about thirty-five, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">white cap bore the insignia of captain, sat in the cockpit</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the pilot and studied the lunar landscape through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his binoculars.

What did Sherard have to say?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harveston gave a brief account of his conversations with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Sherard and the other Earthians, concluding</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the suggestion that The Crescent City also proceed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Tycho. "If you are on the Mare Nubium you are only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few hundred miles from Tycho," he supplemented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, we'll be there, unless the sand prevents our land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing," Ellington assured.

Leaving his sleeping child</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her bunk, he immediately began to explore his sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings, and his first discovery was that the walls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit were several thousand feet high, forming a stump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped eminence in the center of a vast, gently sloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">saucer of dark rock which, in turn, was surrounded by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker, lava-like substance against which the crater's</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous streamers, spreading in every direction, shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in glaring contrast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was scanning the almost perpendicular ramparts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tycho, wondering if they could be scaled, when the hum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a motor caused him to turn. The huge bulk of The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crescent City loomed in the distance. It landed behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, on a smooth space about a mile from the crater, near</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the great rays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Its passengers immediately began streaming out of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">several doors, many of them taking uncanny strides and</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling over one another, befuddled by their new light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. After several attempts, they were able to walk after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fashion. There were about thirty women in the g.roup,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some with babies in their arms, and these proceeded more</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously, being assisted from the plane by the men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Harveston, setting out to meet them, saw them gather</seg><seg type="columnLine">round a tall, white-capped man whom he took to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Ellington, whose gestures indicated that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressing them. He presently pointed toward Harveston</seg><seg type="columnLine">28</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and a minute later started in his direction heading a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cession that moved slowly and fantastically. Some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthians held hands to avoid mishaps, but the most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, except the women and some of the smaller children,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made their own tedious way. There was much overstep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping and consequent tumbles, some of which ended pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully on the hard surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is Professor Sherard?" was Captain Elling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's first question when formal introductions were over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pm wondering myself," Harveston replied.

It was agreed that they would request all</seg><seg type="columnLine">with whom they might communicate to join them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tycho, and that they would meet an hour later and report</seg><seg type="columnLine">results.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ernest and Mildred returned to The Pioneer to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Burke still poring over his hieroglyphics. Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Ellington, having apprised his passengers of his ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject, was followed to The Crescent City by most of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harveston found his little daughter still asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes the signals of the three planes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping the moon at every wave length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of the hour, Ernest reported having spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Hogrefe, the American whom Harveston had men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned, and with an Italian named Casella, who believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in the Lunar Alps. Harveston told of conversing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a fellow-countryman named Banks, with a Canadian</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Farrow, and with a Spaniard whose name he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not catch. Banks was somewhere on the plains, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canadian believed he was on the Mare Tranquillitatis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Ellington had made only one connection, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that with the German, Eckhoff, who said he had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains and landed near a crater. Each ship had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought from two to six passengers, mainly the families</seg><seg type="columnLine">and relatives of the owners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No trace has been found of the Frenchman, LaTaste,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom Harveston had signaled during the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I move that we now visit the nearest ray," Ernest</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I think we shall find it most interesting." He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">then told Ellington of his discoveries at the small crater</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Reaumur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mildred accompanying them, they soon reached the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found, as Ernest had anticipated, that it was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many skillfully executed channels designed to carry water</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the crater by gravity. The bottom of the course was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the same marble-like material Ernest and his compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions had observed at Reaumur, and the sides were plast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with the whitish cement they had seen there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ditch at this point was half a mile wide and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a hundred feet deep, but was narrower and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper toward the crater and less straight in the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, following the wide valleys of the slightly un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulating topography.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose we follow the channel to the base of the ram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">part," Ernest proposed. "I believe the tunnels through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall will be large enough for us to enter and explore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And how thick are the walls, do you suppose?" Mildred</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably a thousand feet or more. We will have to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">our pocket atolights."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They found that Tycho's tunnels were about fourteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in diameter and straight as a rifle bore, though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have been fashioned with crude tools.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tycho reminds me of a mouse trap--one of those with</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes all around," Mildred laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it may prove to be a trap, precipitating us into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit, unless we watch our step," Ernest cautioned as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they prepared to enter the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The base of the wall was even thicker than Ernest had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckoned. They had gone more than a thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they saw light at the other end of the bore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The interior of the ring-plain was bathed in sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they reached the tunnel's end, and they were awed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the scene that greeted them, stunned by the vastness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it all; it was so great in diameter that the eye could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not encompass it; the basin was shaped like a shallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">cup and as smooth in places as asphalt. Its central region,</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely visible to the unaided eye, appeared to be not more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a thousand feet below the level of the moon's surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Earthians first viewed the great bowl through their</seg><seg type="columnLine">binoculars, and then through a small telescope which Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Ellington had with him. The latter glass revealed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle of openings near the center.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are they, Sherard--more tunnels?" Harveston</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aqueducts," Ernest replied.

Imagine my surprise to find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular plain in the midst of the mountains. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly across it before I saw the something that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">me reconsider, all of the sudden.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I made another discovery. I was sweeping the plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my binoculars, to see what I could see, when my</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention was attracted by what seemed to be rows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings at the bases of the encircling mountains.

"It will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great journey, but something tells me one of us shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">never return." His voice became grave. "I have always</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoffed at prescience and the like, and now I'm beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to believe in it. I have persistent presentiment that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains are the end of the road for me. Fate, perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I've always held that fate and chance were one. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a strange dream during my_ last sleep. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was standing before the great He-She on Mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hadley, studying its hideous physiognomy, when its lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a malicious leer and uttered my name with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hellish cry of vengeance. The nightmare lingers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense!" Ernest enjoined, puzzled at his compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion's gloomy turn. "You have simply overtaxed your</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves struggling with those hieroglyphics. I don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is any danger ahead of us, but I insist that you stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind and take a long nap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must, Professor; please do," Mildred pleaded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ernest and I can see it through. I demand that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, my child," he soothed. "I must go. If fate decrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">my finish, why rebel? See, I've become a fatalist over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. If my foreboding is nonsense, as Ernest says, no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">harm will come of my going--we will have a good laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it when we return. I haven't been feeling quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself for some hours, and maybe the trip will revive me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, I want to explore the bottom of one of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">craters. I believe I shall find proof of the theory that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pits are the remains of gigantic bubbles raised by</seg><seg type="columnLine">volcanic gases when the moon was molten. The very</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallow cup of Bailly will offer an excellent opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">for study. Yes, I must go, Mildred. Only a coward is</seg><seg type="columnLine">frighted by dreams--or by death itself, for that matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Further expostulation only rousing him to anger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ernest and Mildred reluctantly consented to his going,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and decided to start at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But let's go out first and see if it is raining," Mildred</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stepped into a fine mist that trickled off the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of The Pioneer in apologetic globules.

More cheerfully: "The mountains are just</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other side, aren't they?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About seventy miles beyond, I should say," Ernest</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied, remarking the forced buoyancy of the query.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We could see them now, but for the mist."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moonscape became slaty and sloping as they neared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bailly proved to be even shallower than Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burke had anticipated. The ramparts of the great ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long bowl were not more than four thousand feet high</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were pierced at the base by water bores to drain</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surrounding lowlands. And when The Pioneer had</seg><seg type="columnLine">topped the ramparts and dropped to a lower level, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupants found that the interior of the pit was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spicuously different from that of Tycho. Instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnels ending at the inside rim, they continued, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the form of aqueducts, for several miles, resting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">arches built over a bed of lava-like rock so porous that</seg><seg type="columnLine">its fissures overlapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It looks like petrified sponge," Professor Burke sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted. "It is evident that the holes were made by</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaping gas, and I'm satisfied the craters were formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON OF DOOM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by huge bubbles. But if Bailly was used as a reservoir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why wasn't its bottom cemented like that of Tycho?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ernest could offer no explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see!" the Professor exclaimed upon turning his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses toward the center of the basin. "Only the deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est part is cemented--out there where the aqueducts end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there are no feeders coming in from the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The center of Bailly was found to be a depression some</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve miles in diameter, forming a great bowl which</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently had been enlarged and deepened by the Moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and into which the connecting aqueducts once</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured their precious burden. The basin was so smooth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly plastered that it seemed enameled, and at its bottom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming a semi-circle on the side nearest the Dorfels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a row of openings which they took to be the mouths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water mains leading to the mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" cried Professor Burke, pointing toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deepest part of the bowl. "Look!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Water--a tiny pool of it--was there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Pioneer was over the farther ramparts when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mildred espied the peaks of the Dorfels. The mist was</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanishing and the clouds beginning to rift.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Dorfels were downhill from Bailly, the declension</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting just beyond the crater's rim and becoming more</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronounced each mile. No pressure had been needed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry the water to the sub-montane dwellings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mountains rose sheer from the foot of the decline,</seg><seg type="columnLine">presenting an almost perpendicular cliff similar to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of Mount Hadley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ernest first sighted the Dorfel caves, and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">simultaneously Mildred called attention to the crumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins of several buildings some three miles in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The caves dotted the base of the cliff its entire length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distance of several miles. Most of the openings were</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniformly small and square, but near the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">row yawned a relatively large circular aperture. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was toward this opening that Ernest aimed the plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd like to detour and explore the ruins," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but we'll leave that for another day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Pioneer came to rest about a hundred yards from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big cave. Professor Burke hurried out and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first to reach the entrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just as I thought," he said when his companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined him. "The inscriptions say that this is the cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mighty He-She--the place of the sacrifice.

"We are now at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance of the lunar catacombs. It was here that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead of the cave city were brought. The inscrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions say that the 'hall' extends nearly a mile and leads</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a labyrinth of larger cavities which constituted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">catacombs. I wonder if the Moonmen were embalmers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The writings are not clear on that point. And if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, it is likely that their frail bodies returned to dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of centuries ago. Do you want to go in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">explore the tombs, Mildred ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl shuddered. "I'm too imaginative to go in</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, even if we had time. I'd be seeing wraiths every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, here we are," the Professor apprised at the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, which was some distance from the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necropolis. "This is the beginning of the Moonmen's</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitations. Shall we go in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ernest suggested that they go farther down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"street" to ascertain its probable length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A good idea. It's a pity the doors aren't num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered so we could learn what block we're on." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor seemed to have emerged from his doldrums.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The inscriptions deal principally with the names of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the occupants," the Professor imparted as they moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, pausing at each door. "The names are meaningless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't translate them into words we might pronounce."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Since it appears that the caves continue indefinitely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose we go no farther," Ernest proposed when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were nearly a mile from their starting point. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain there is room for all the Earthians likely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the moon. This cave looks as good as any, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the Professor is willing, we'll go in and look it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then hurry back to the plane."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They flashed their lights and entered the darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor leading and Ernest holding Mildred's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. The strong shafts of light danced feebly, eerily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the forbidding gloom ahead. The shadows moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">like animate things, like sullen and sinister entities, rue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, resentful, malignant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stepping slowly and cautiously, the explorers swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior with their atolights until the rebellious</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows were dispersed enough to reveal a circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber some eighty feet in diameter whose vaulted</seg><seg type="columnLine">top and smooth walls attested lunar artisanry. Hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of inscriptions and numerous drawings were cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the rock, and many large strata of the yellow ore</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This was a sort of parlor where they gathered during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warmer part of the day," Professor Burke observed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's look for the outlet--I mean the entrance to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">living quarters. I should say--say, what's this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His foot had struck something that emitted a metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. He focused his light on the object as his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions drew nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It's a table--no, it's a sort of seat. And look--it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of tempered gold!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a narrow bench similar in construction to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had known on Earth except that its legs were longer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was lying on its side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Professor bent over it for a closer examination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's gold, all right," he confirmed, "and I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's more of them lying round. We'll have to be care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mildred made the next discovery. "Look! There it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is! Turn your lights on the farther side of the wall!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The three rays disclosed a passage that led toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowels of the mountains--a square tunnel which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold the pent-up darkness of a thousand Hades--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a blackness which the powerful atolights pierced, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to diffuse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Must we really go in?" Mildred asked apprehensively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her imagination pictured the darkness as that of Erebus</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, and she fancied she could hear the lamentations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lost as they trod down the dusky aisle into eternal</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Don't be afraid, little girl," Professor Burke said</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently. "There's nothing to harm us. The darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot kill."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't think there is any danger," Ernest reassured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but if you wish, you can remain at the door until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor and I return. We won't be gone long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no," Mildred protested. "What if you should</seg><seg type="columnLine">get lost in there? I was a little nervous, but I'm quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right now. I insist on going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holding hands, they made their way to the passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and entered cautiously. Their atolights illuminated their</seg><seg type="columnLine">path only a few feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, the floor seems solid enough," the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked. It was scarcely more than a whisper, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoes, wakened from their eon of sleep, reverberated</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominously and boomed back the words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And so do the walls," Ernest observed after they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone a goodly distance. "The Lunarians were adept</seg><seg type="columnLine">burrowers, at least."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were fully a quarter of a mile from the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance when they came upon long rows of slabbed doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">which extended on either side of the hall as far as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see. The slabs were covered with inscriptions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, here are the Moonmen's apartments," the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor announced. "Shall we go in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But the doors appear to be sealed," Ernest remarked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't think so. I daresay the slabs are on hinges,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and open from the inside. The Moonmen had to shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the cold, you know. Let's push against this one."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're on hinges, all right," the Professor attested</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the door yielded to their united strength. "Look out!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stone gave way and fell inside with a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">thud that brought to life a thousand yowling echoes. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomb-like odor, almost malefic, smote them'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a3 I suspected," Burke drawled. "The Moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men didn't have sense enough to invent hinges."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed his atolight into the room. The black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was all but solid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we won't go in there for a while," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's go farther down the hall--maybe we'll find an</seg><seg type="columnLine">open door and the air will be less malodorous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Such an aperture soon came into view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I guess we'll be safe in this one," the Professor ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured. "There's quite a draft in the hall, if you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed, and this room should be well ventilated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time. Ready to go in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Still holding hands, they flashed their lights through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening and stepped inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A square chamber, not more than forty feet across,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was revealed as the light swept its walls. In one cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner they discerned an object that looked like a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">cot, and near it were two small benches. In the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each wall was a passage hewn through the rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the entrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A regular room, if it had windows," Ernest observed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What is that protruding from the wall over there?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A water pipe, I'll wager," the Professor said. "Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">go over and see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Correct again," he certified upon examining the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jection. "And look under it--there's the basin that</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the water as it trickled in from the crater." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to a cup-shaped excavation in the floor. "Rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude plumbing, but it served the purpose, no doubt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, let's explore the adjoining rooms."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They passed through the door to their left and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves in a room similar to the one behind them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All of the rooms seem to connect," Ernest com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON OF DOOM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mented, noting the doors that led to still other apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, 'connecting rooms but no bath,' as it were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless they bathed in their drinking water," the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor chuckled. "Well, what do you say about return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the plane? There seems to be an abundance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms, and our heat and light can make them fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable. And the ventilation won't be such a prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem, with each room opening into another. The Moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were not so dumb, after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait just a minute," Mildred said as they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to go. "There's one of those strange beds over</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the corner, and I think there are diamonds on</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I saw something flash as I turned my light there a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mildred, this was the death-bed of some poor Moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman who must have perished in the last days, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the living were unable to bury the dead," the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered as they leaned over the dusty slab of the cot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"See, there are two armlets and two anklets, set with</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious stones, lying in the dust they once adorned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you care to examine them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wouldn't touch them for worlds," the girl shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered. "Let's go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ernest, let's peep into the cave of He-She before</seg><seg type="columnLine">we leave," the Professor pleaded when they were again</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sunlight. "It won't take but a minute or two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pm sure we can spare the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ernest wanted to demur, but yielded to his compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion's entreating tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't take but a minute or two," Burke repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">as thev prepared to enter the cave. "Are you afraid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mildred?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Professor, I'm almost as eager as you to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the thing looks like."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stepped inside and found themselves facing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone wall only a few feet from the entrance. A square</seg><seg type="columnLine">door yawned in its center.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll see it through," Ernest answered the Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor's questioning look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They felt the tingle of eerie adventure as their next</seg><seg type="columnLine">step took them through the opening and they flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lights into the inner darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There it is!" Mildred cried. "I can see its blazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes! Turn your lights on them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He-She, in all its hypnotic hideousness, leered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its throne in the deeper shadows as the light fell full</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its fantastic face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then a thunderous thud sounded behind them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light from the entrance went out.

The girl was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to his arm. "Let's examine the door, Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor; maybe it's only a rock that has fallen and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can push it away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That damned demon did it, I tell you," Burke</seg><seg type="columnLine">vociferated as they turned their lights toward the erst-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">while opening. "Well, what do you know about that!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's the work of fiends!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was no stone that barred their exit.

"What concerns us now is what will cause it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise." He pounded the door with his fist and gave it</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lusty kick. "It's at least a foot thick and made of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tempered gold. If we had a crowbar-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our atorays would make short work of it, if I hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so stupid as to leave them in the plane," Ernest</seg><seg type="columnLine">deplored.

Three of its walls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly finished, but the one to the left of the entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was smooth and bore many inscriptions. The floor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of large stone blocks, closely fitted. A small bench</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one corner was the only furnishing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The prisoners gave only passing attention to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">details--they found it impossible to keep their gaze off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grotesque figure of the moon god.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The uncouth form of He-She occupied a throne-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Structure that rested against the center of the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. The monster was about twelve feet high in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting posture, and was made of stone and tempered</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold, with many-faceted eyes of enormous diamonds, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of its bas-relief replica on Mount Hadley. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, body and legs were stone, its arms gold; and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its lap, clutched between its massive knees, was a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden bowl above which, poised menacingly, was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">block of yellow metal gripped in its scaly hands. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms were jointed and apparently movable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Thing's face was even more repulsive than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its Mount Hadley likeness.

Stratum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold here and there--only mocking gold. Silently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely, their hearts beating a tat-too they could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the abated hissing of He-She, they moved on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side of the idol and resumed their quest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here it is! Here it is!" Mildred exulted, flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her light on a dark streak near the bottom of the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Burke dropped to his knees for a closer scrut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iny. About a foot of the seam showed above the floor for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some three yards. He passed his hand over its smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface and then scratched it with his nails, collecting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinch of dust in his palm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It looks like coal, but we mustn't rejoice too soon," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, after a minute that seemed an eternity. "Wait until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we get some of it out and see if it will burn. Confound</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, Ernest, I guess we'll have to dig it out with our hands."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've got it!" the younger man flashed after a perplexed</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. "We'll wrest a leg from the bench in the comer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and use it as &amp; pry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The supports of the bench proved to be made of tem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pered gold, and after much twisting and pulling, they re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved one of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took them but a brief space to loosen several lumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the soft mineral.

Fuel, but no way to kindle it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In vain the two men searched their pockets for paper;</seg><seg type="columnLine">futiley they struck match after match and held them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finer particles. The stuff glowed, but would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ernest rose suddenly and doffed his coat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm going to use it for kindling," he explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shed yours, too, Professor. Perhaps they'll burn enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to light the smaller lumps. It's certainly worth trying."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll contribute my hat!" Mildred fluttered. It's flimsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to burn readily."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we'll light it first," Ernest accepted, and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded to make the attempt. "Hold up the coats, Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor, and I'll use the hat as a flare."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joyfully they beheld the spurt of flame cling to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woolen garments. Ernest then took the coats, laid them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor and put several small lumps of the mineral</seg><seg type="columnLine">on top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In excruciating suspense they watched the flames dally</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the bits of black. And when the lumps at last be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to blaze, it seemed they were witnessing the miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire for the first time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's bituminous," the Professor rejoiced as Ernest</seg><seg type="columnLine">consigned larger chunks to the fire. "The inscriptions</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Mount Hadley said something about the Moonmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting their fuel from the mountains, but I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea it was real coal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They seated themselves close to the blaze and reveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its genial warmth. Compared with their staid ato-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaters, an open fire suddenly seemed a wonderful thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They grew reminiscent under the spell of the glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">embers and talked of many things. They agreed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their life on Earth now seemed a separate existence, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of vivid dream. Their present state was even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreal. Had they dreamed the flight through space, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">were they dreaming now?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length they became aware that He-She had ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">its dissonance. Thirst and incipient hunger reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">them they had been in the cave several hours. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble light from the rifts in the roof was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible, and they knew that it was night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The realization caused Professor Burke to relapse into</seg><seg type="columnLine">despondency. For several minutes he sat smoking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe in silence, staring dejectedly into the coals, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face funereal as the surrounding gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when he raised his head and spoke his voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy with hopelessness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have cheated the cold only to perish more miser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably.

Each day the moon was shrouded in ecliptic gloom</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more than four hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During, the early part of the nights, which were get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting warmer as the moon retained more of the sun's heat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earthians did little but gaze upon the monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother globe whose green expanse, all but monopolizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavens, flooded the satellite with emerald brilliance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terra was now "the moon's moon"--Terra the terrible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening to destroy the daughter sphere she had driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">away at birth, and whose revengeful return was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperiling her own existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the long periods of sunlight the men, accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied by some of the more adventurous women, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">many exploration trips into the caves and mountains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The nearest mountains were visited first, and yielded</seg><seg type="columnLine">much new knowledge concerning the vanished Lunarians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Various kinds of furnishings--all made of tempered</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold--were found, and many other golden objects, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as basins, urns and the like, not to mention bracelets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anklets and other jeweled adornments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The caves fairly reeked with gold.

There were four vaults of diamonds, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pearls, and two of a strange red-green stone that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a mating of ruby and emerald. Some of the dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monds, all of which were cut, weighed more than a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand carats.

The wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightly arched chamber was about twenty-five feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and regularly studded, row on row, with round seals</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold fitted flat with the surface so close together that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they almost touched. There were fourteen full tiers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and another, at the top, extended almost half round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Removing one of the plates with their atorays. the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explorers found a cylindrical cavity about three feet wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">that penetrated horizontally into the hard rock a distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of about twelve feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A handful of dust was all that remained of the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature whose tomb the cylinder had been--a handful</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dust in which reposed a few tarnished ornaments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a score of seals had been removed in the hope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding a mummified Moonman, the explorers, convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quest was futile, turned their attention to a circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevation in the center of the chamber. It proved to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flat-topped structure some seven feet high and twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">across, with steps all round, and Harveston and Ellington</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed that it was a sort of dais where the lunar priests</seg><seg type="columnLine">had performed their funeral functions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, beginning to feel the effects of the musty, insuffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient air, the party left the gold-studded place of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was raining when they emerged from the tunnel half</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour later--raining so hard that the Earthfolk had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken to the caves. A blinding flash of lightning greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harveston and Ellington as they reached the mount of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage, but this did not deter them from hurrying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ernest's quarters to report their discovery. They found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and Mildred standing near the door of their cave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl exulting in the storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next morning Ernest called the people together and</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressed them:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another Great Change faces us, and no one can fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell what it will bring," he began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The earth is less than thirty-one thousand miles way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the stage of critical proximity is very near. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon may stop when it has gone a few hundred more</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles, or it may not pause until it is within twenty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles of the planet. And we are not sure it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But when it has gone a few thousand more miles, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most, and the attraction of the earth is counterbal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anced by the push of the tides, one of three things must</seg><seg type="columnLine">take place: the moon will pause for a brief period and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then recede rather rapidly, or go back at a snail's pace, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall to Earth like a plummet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe, however, that a quick recession will occur.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is in accordance with the Bartonian theory, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that the satellite, after being flung from its molten</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother, receded at a rate of several thousand miles a day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its speed gradually diminishing as the tidal force de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased until, when it had gone approximately 150,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles, it all but came to a stop, and required millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">years to attain the distance it had prior to The Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Change. It would seem, of course, that its early recession</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be more rapid than the latter stage of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance, but when the tension of its pausing period is</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken the tidal reaction will probably cause it to spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">away for the first few thousand miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I said in suggesting the migration to the moon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth would be habitable with the moon no nearer than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">150,000	miles. But could we survive the moon's return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its old orbit? And would we ever be able to return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth? These questions are unanswerable. It is pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, however, that the satellite would retain some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet's atmosphere for a while, and that the air path</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two bodies, though much thinner than at</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, would be dense enough to support our atoplanes</seg><seg type="columnLine">operating under full power. And it is possible that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could set sail for Earth before the moon reacherl the</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 ."0.000-mile point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON OF DOOM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If the Bartonian theory does not hold, it will take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere centuries to recede a thousand miles, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">event Earth's rotation and frigid temperature would</seg><seg type="columnLine">render it unhabitable for eons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is a possibility, of course, that neither of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things will occur. It may be true, as Professor Burke</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared, that the moon will crash into the planet. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am confident it will stop. The earth is so near that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see, without the telescope, that its surface is a broken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving mass. This means that the globe's fearful ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation has kept the ice from becoming a solid crust. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">world is wrapped in a polar sea whose colossal icebergs</seg><seg type="columnLine">churn everywhere as mountainous waves, lashed to fury,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap toward the tormenting moon. But for the tides, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon long since would have crashed into the earth. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is, I believe they are powerful enough, with the atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">attraction nearly if not entirely dissipated, to stop tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">satellite and send it back into space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And when the moon falters, hard pressed by contend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing forces, its greatest tribulation will begin. It is then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Earth will have her revenge. The push and pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">will shake the smaller sphere to its very core. And at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, when the breaking point comes and the moon is cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">back for a few thousand miles, its convulsions will all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The moonquake will be of indeterminable duration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it is then that our fate will hang in the balance.

"It's a range not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">corded on our lunar maps. They could not be seen from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth because this part of the moon was always in</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow. It means we are beyond the lunar south pole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on the threshold of the other side."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How near are the mountains?" The girl's voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct with excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably not more than ten miles, and they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be about fifteen thousand feet high, and the summits, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, are white. The breaking up of the light--see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's not much of it left now--is due to the sinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun. We had better rise before all the light is gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I suppose we can rely on our searchlights to avoid a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash, but I don't care to take a chance with those moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains until I learn their height and how they rise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But won't it be too dark for us to explore the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not much darker than it is here, but darker than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected. The sun is still high a few hundred miles be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind us, you know, and due to the air scattering the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">it won't be so very dark beyond the mountains--unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">we go too far. I don't intend to do much exploring--only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to satisfy myself about that lunar sea, and I have an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea we'll find it just on the other side. We probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall be returning within two hours. I don't think we</seg><seg type="columnLine">need fear about what we'll find on the other side. Still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is some danger--the unknown is never safe. Should</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything happen to our plane, it is possible we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">never return. Perhaps we should go no farther, Mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred. I'm not afraid, but I am thinking of you. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no need to run the risk. We've already experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough suffering at the hands of the moon, and I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a brute to carry you into further peril. Suppose we</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the other side alone. Come, let us return to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caves. I insist."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl knew he spoke sincerely, but only for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake. Alone, he would have dared mountains twice as</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and skiej as dark again. She could be as brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wouldn't think of returning," she replied. "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite unafraid, and really eager to go on. If it is too</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly we needn't land. Let's hurry before all the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">is gone from the peaks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ernest applied nearly all of The Pioneer's energy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helicopter and the big plane shot up like a balloon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivering to the strain. At fifteen thousand feet, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow on the peaks was still above them. Half a mile high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er, and the few remaining flashes were under them, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently about ten miles away. Ernest then stopped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helicopter and steered straight ahead. Of the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains, nothing was visible until the plane was</seg><seg type="columnLine">within two miles of the light. Then, through the dusk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they discerned enough of the mighty range to know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it rose almost perpendicular, and that the tops alone ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be whitish stone, probably marble. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nature had tried to erect an insurmountable wall to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide the moon's black back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last light on the peaks went out just as they passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, but more gaunt ridges were faintly visible through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gloom. Ernest descended a few hundred feet to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a better view of them, holding the plane to its slowest</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace and turning the searchlights full ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had gone not more than twenty miles when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains disappeared suddenly from under them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">range evidently ended as abruptly as it began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The other side of the moon!" Ernest rejoiced. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">where shall we go now? I think I'll go on for a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">while and find a landing place. Perhaps-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hissing, sputtering sound came from the motors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The plane lurched downward so suddenly that Ernest</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost lost control of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's nothing serious, little girl," he assured his startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion. "Just an oil leak. I think I can repair it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes after we land. We'll glide down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After many spirals, which should have brought it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, The Pioneer kept descending. The altimeter showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ernest he was below sea level.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're over the bed of the lunar ocean," he remarked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few more spirals, and the searchlights brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottonuof the great basin to view. The Pioneer careened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a stop on a bed of pebbles and sand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, our tour of exploration is over," Ernest said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We must return as soon as I repair the plane. It's much</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker here than I anticipated. But come, let's get out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side for a bit, so we can say we've stood on the floor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lunar sea. We'll pocket a few pebbles as proof."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keeping in the path of the searchlights, they strayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a short distance, picked up a handful of the smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks, and were about to return when Mildred gave a cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">of discovery and held up her find for inspection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the shell of a huge bivalve, nearly as large again</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any they had ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we know where the Moonmen got their pearls,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ernest commented, "but how did they get across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains? How Professor Burke would have enjoyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">solving that mystery. And I guess he would have wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to set out at once and find the beds of the rivers that fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea. There were no big streams on the exposed side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, so all of the rivers must have had their sources</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the hidden half. Come, let us return to the ship. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I can repair the leak from the inside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trouble proved more serious than Ernest thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The motors were almost drowned in oil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After three hours the job still baffled him. It was get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting. quite dark, and Mildred, watching the stars, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished to see those near the horizon blotted out rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly. Clouds were gathering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within another hour the entire sky was overcast, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then came inordinate flashes of lightning that revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of the surrounding basin and silhouetted the nearby</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains. The boom of the thunder was ear-splitting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ernest finished soldering the leak just as the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope it doesn't last long," he said. "The sun will</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon be down on the other side, and unless we get back</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the mountains by then, we'll have to stay until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">rises again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the storm lingered, growing in fury. The down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pour was as heavy as any they had seen on Earth. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the elements ceased their frenzy and the stars came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out again--came out in splendor far more gorgeous than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earth pair had seen since their trip through space--</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was night, and darkness, Cimmerian darkness, fell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them like a suffocating blanket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ernest switched off the searchlights and turned on all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior illumination. The radio soon had them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch with Captain Ellington's ship, and Ernest apprised</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the operator of what had occurred. "Tell Ellington we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are in no danger and will be back in camp in a few hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">after daybreak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Communication with the camp was established at in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervals during the early hours of the night, and Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Burke's books also helped to while away the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">until Mildred fell asleep, her head on Ernest's shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Back to Earth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> T must have been near midnight when the moonquake</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    The great paroxysm came without warning. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere reeled as from a staggering blow. Reverberations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sepulchral and oppressive, cluttered the air. The moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped and jerked, curveted and convulsed until its epi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lepsy seemed a dance of death. The Earth pair felt The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pioneer slip and slide, and knew that the surface was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On into the night the upheaval continued with increas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing intensity. Ernest knew that the moon was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken to its very center, and doubted whether it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">survive the torture. The din of the havoc became deaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening, overwhelming. A staccato ululation rose above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumbling. Terra was having her revenge, and Luna was</seg><seg type="columnLine">howling her terrible agony and hate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The major struggle ended as abruptly as it began. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock that racked the satellite to the verge of destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the finale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was over, but the vanquished orb kept quivering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ernest, looking at the stars, saw them scurry across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sable sky, and knew that the moon was being shot back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He immediately tried to signal the camp, and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and again. Silence. He feared the worst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon as the murksome morning broke over the vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea, The Pioneer was off. The mountains were crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">without difficulty. Some of their peaks, as seen through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gloom, appeared to have toppled. And a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, when the plane burst into the sunlight, the marred</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon lay revealed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What had been a plain was now an anomalous waste.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The surface was cracked, warped, sunken, bloated. Huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks protruded here and there. Some of the fissures</seg><seg type="columnLine">were abysmal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last vestige of hope for the survival of their com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rades perished as soon as the Dorfels came into view. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great range was utterly ravaged and all but overthrown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From a distance it was seen that hundreds of peaks had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracked and crashed, and when The Pioneer passed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devastation, thousands of prodigious fissures yawned</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungrily. Here and there appeared great sinks, as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains had been mere papier-mache mounds trod on</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Gog and Magog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when The Pioneer landed, not a trace of the cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">city could be seen. Millions of tons of rock had avalanched</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the troubled heights and snuffed out all. Ernest</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed that the destruction came with the moon's first</seg><seg type="columnLine">spasm, and that the planes, at the doors of the caves, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been buried before Earth's last lot, hurrying from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapsing cells, could reach them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Infinite loneliness and sadness engulfed the man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. Realization that they were Earth's last pair stunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, left them dazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When, after many minutes, Ernest spoke, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hollow. "Alone in a universe of death," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps it were better we had perished, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, during the nightmare days that followed, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were waiting for the regressing moon to undo some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the damage on the planet, that they might venture</seg><seg type="columnLine">to return, they fancied more than once that they had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">in truth, and now were phantoms on a spectral sphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Occasionally F.rnest would point his telescope at the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON OF DOOM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and once Mildred visited the garden she had planted near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor's grave, and found green things growing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The grave itself was buried under the slide of rock, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the nearby house of He-She.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	• * * *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE man and one woman--Terra's final twain--strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling through space on a treacherous thread of air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind them a mobile moon, tremulous in retreat.

With all motors going at top speed, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not make more than four hundred miles an hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once a small "pocket" was encountered and the plane fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The telescope revealed that Earth's ice-shroud was</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking up rapidly, and when they had gone about half</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance, land began to appear.

There was land where water</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been, and seas where land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when the continents became more clearly outlined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were utterly alien to those with which the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair was familiar. Great ice ridges appeared on most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, near the equatorial line, and extended far to sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Americas could be discerned, but seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrunk greatly, and the isthmus region was a zone of ice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the exception of Australia, which was readily rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognized, they could not be sure of the other continents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Much of what they took to be Europe had disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sea or under an ice sheet which covered the south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern part Much of Asia, including all its island fringe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">likewise was gone. The northern half of Africa was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden entirely by an ice cap, and part of its southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast had been washed away. Small islands had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">born in every sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The turning of the globe bared another astounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">change: the poles were no longer icebound! Land hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">since some previous glacial age lay naked, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was much more of it near each pole than geologists had</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed. There were still some glaciers on it, however,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and thousands of great icebergs in the surrounding seas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The truth dawned suddenly on Ernest--the tortured</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth had shifted on its axis!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Pioneer was now descending rapidly, bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">other changes into view. It was seen that all the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain ranges had been worn down, some of the smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains having virtually disappeared. There were many;</seg><seg type="columnLine">new rivers, and some of the old ones were blotted out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dark blotches here and there in the interior of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinents probably were the remains of cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ernest brought his ship to rest on the coast of a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinent which he believed to be Greenland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later the man and the girl were plod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding along the beach, learning to walk again. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have become things of lead, ponderous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumbersome. It was as if they had never known Earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was shining and a breath of warmth was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, though the chill from the icebergs warned of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter nights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ambling some distance from the shore, they found</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass and weeds cropping up. Earth was not dead, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. It would give them sustenance, and so might the sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was enough concentrated food in the plane to last</seg><seg type="columnLine">them several months, and then they could plant the grain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vegetable seed left by Professor Burke. The Pioneer</seg><seg type="columnLine">would house them and protect them from the cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Another Adam and Eve, but a strange Eden," Ernest</seg><seg type="columnLine">said whimsically.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe was intact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Roger Bolton, the cashier, was the last of an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">family, which had numbered statesmen, engineers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">educators in its ranks, from early in the nineteenth cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tury. His college career had been brilliant. He had won</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right to wear the University letter on his sweater;</seg><seg type="columnLine">in short, at thirty, he might be considered to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">launched himself on a fine career in the world of</seg><seg type="columnLine">finance.

Olive Velie, at twenty-five, was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmarried, although her opportunities included four</seg><seg type="columnLine">or five possible titles and two or three possible bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onial estates. She had large dreamy eyes, above which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were delicately lined brows, a nose not too large, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely negligible, a mouth, not exactly bowed but</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather inclined at times to a straight-lined severity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her chin was well rounded, cheeks not too full and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck was very shapely and pillar like. She was full</seg><seg type="columnLine">bosomed and had abundant dark hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Olive had walked into her father's office while he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussing with Roger Bolton, the terms of a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue of Molgravian bonds--Molgravia being one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Balkan States somewhat enlarged by the League of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nations after the World War. Bolton's grasp of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject aroused old Veiie's admiration to such an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent that he complimented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young man on his sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested distribution of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of the loan.

For six months much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young man's spare time was spent at the Velie</seg><seg type="columnLine">residence or accompanying Olive to one function or</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. They were soon engaged, but their marriage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was placed in the indefinite future, because Bolton re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded $10,000 a year as a poor match for the Velie</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is how matters stood on the day the people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Houston congregated about the Castile Bank and Trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">Company's twelve story building. In the interval be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the placing of the $100,000 in the safe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bolton's return the following morning, the entire sum</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disappeared. This mon&lt;,y was in notes but by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some curious oversight, the sum of $10,000 in gold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was not part of the Molgravian loan, had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been touched. Bolton, dumbfounded, could not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggest an explanation. Indeed his sudden look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror, so far from his ordinary bearing of cool cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, at once gave rise to sinister suspicion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The safe which had recently been installed remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all appearances exactly as it had been the previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon, but the money was gone.

No alarm had been sounded during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Nothing indicated that the safe had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken into. Nothing had been disturbed in the bank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed obvious that Bolton had placed only a few pack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages in the safe and had secreted the $100,000 some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where during the night. And as Bolton offered no ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation, he was placed under arrest</seg><seg type="columnLine">The citizens, who had almost idolized this young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, who had made such rapid strides under their</seg><seg type="columnLine">very observation, were immediately convinced they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been nursing a viper and the downcast Bolton was</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted with jeers as a patrol wagon carried him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">headquarters for a severe grilling which involved end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less repetition of the never ending query-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What have you done with the loot?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Olive Velie, after a night of rosy dreams for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future, in which Bolton was steadily rising in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">financial world, awoke to a rude disenchantment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When she saw a copy of the Houston Globe, a photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph of her sweetheart gazed at her beneath a</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamer which announced, "Houston's most promi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent banker arrested.

A light was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining directly into his eyes.

An assistant cashier coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from another city, but whose credentials had seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be good, was also missing. Naturally, it was as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed they were Roger's accomplices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore, as a welcome relief to the same endless</seg><seg type="columnLine">question, Roger was asked from time to time . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is the watchman?" or "Where is the assis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant cashier?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Roger stood the ordeal well. Finally, to bring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiry to some kind of coherence, the officers let New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York counsel, selected by Tom Velie, visit him. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">installed 'dictaphones in order to record any slip Roger</seg><seg type="columnLine">might make while he was being interviewed. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hopeless. He would only say . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know nothing at all about the robbery.

Your lawyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have something to work on, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This conversation delighted the listening police and</seg><seg type="columnLine">detectives who were taking notes at high speed. Hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing decided that Roger was guilty, all these details</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been overlooked or left for the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thursday afternoon, my last day at the bank,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Roger, "our new safe had just been installed.

But in this new safe, I placed $100,000, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of our subscription to the Molgravian loan--</seg><seg type="columnLine">our proportion of their new $50,000,000 issue floated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">through New York banks with your father's aid. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was classified into denominations and each package</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully marked with the amount in each. In a steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, in the same safe, was $10,000 in gold. I wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">if that is gone, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not," said Olive. "That makes it all the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious for you. But don't worry. What did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know of those two men who are missing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very little. The president of the bank, Mr. Briscoe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">said they came to him highly recommended. Lawson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the assistant cashier, knew all about foreign loans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His accent, however, made me suspect that Lawson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not his real name. Then, he was so much above</seg><seg type="columnLine">his position. He was of slight physique, machine-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his mind. His memory was prodigious. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">never wavered. Just looked right through you. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchman was not a Houston man, but evidently had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had experience in guarding banks. I never said more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than 'How do you do?' to him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you have told me some things the lawyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't get out of you and that will help some. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roger, don't lose your head and don't worry if I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">not over to see you again for awhile."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She held him in a kind of motherly embrace for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment and left the prison. When she reached New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, Olive went straight to Mr. Willoughby with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not much in that, Miss Velie," he said, "but where</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are certain our client is innocent, it is a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">help. So far, the only proof of Bolton's guilt is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that the money has disappeared. And that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty nearly enough to convict. Whatever you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do from now on, Miss Velie, will not be too much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Castile Bank and Trust Company carried both</seg><seg type="columnLine">burglary insurance and protection against em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bezzlement. In addition to this, Roger was bonded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sum of $25,000. Consequently, these two insur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance companies at once set their sleuths on the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the missing money. After one week of investiga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, they were just where they had started. Roger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was arraigned and charged with the embezzlement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">$100,000 from the Castile Bank and Trust Company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Houston officials called on Inspector Craven of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York police department to look into the robbery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the money could be recovered and the guilty brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to justice, Inspector Craven was the man to do it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Combined with bulldog tenacity, his keenness and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of how criminal minds worked, was his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable intelligence in finding a motive for the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious underworld blows at society. A friend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Velie, he discussed the robbery with him before</seg><seg type="columnLine">visiting Houston. Though reluctant to jump at con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusions, Inspector Craven said frankly it looked pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad for Roger Bolton. Nor was he less frank with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roger himself whtfn he saw that far from cheerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Bolton," he began, "I am familiar with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts as far as they are known. What I want you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do is to offer me some theory or point to some person,</seg><seg type="columnLine">other than yourself, who might have opened that safe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken the money out, and set the combination again."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Inspector Craven," Bolton replied, "to accuse any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else is entirely beyond me. Not even the president</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bank knew the combination to that safe. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was my own responsibility. The combination was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head. No one could have read it for it was never</seg><seg type="columnLine">written. Either there is a way to open that safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">without knowing the combination, impossible in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion, or the money went through the walls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe, which is equally impossible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Mr. Bolton," said Inspector Craven, rising,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"if you intend to make that statement to a jury, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may as well prepare to spend the next few years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ATOMIC RIDDLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">your life in prison. If the sum of $10,000 in gold had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not remained in the safe, I should almost adopt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory that the safe had been removed and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">substituted in its place. That is as fantastic as your</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposition that the money walked through the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the safe. Knowing you, and Tom Velie, and es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecially Miss Olive Velie, I accept for the moment, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, your pleas of innocence. Perhaps after I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined the safe, I may change my opinion. Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">bye."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the prison, Inspector Craven walked the short</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance to the Castile Bank and Trust Company. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Briscoe came at once to greet him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you do, Inspector," he said. "Come right</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. I suppose you want to look around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Mr. Briscoe. Is the safe about as it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night of the robbery?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has not been touched.

Of course, two employes have disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, but neither the assistant cashier nor the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchman knew the combination. Then, too, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely no sign of any disturbance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led the way to the safe. It was not specially</seg><seg type="columnLine">large, but was formidable looking, nevertheless. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was about five feet high, with a combination</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock of respectable size.

At the Magnolia Hotel she learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Jarvis had gone to Touro Infirmary to deliver</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lecture at ten-thirty.

This lecture, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, had to do with Pyloric ulcers. He reviewed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the benefit of the nurses, the various forms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatment; first, an operation by which the pylorus</seg><seg type="columnLine">was severed at its junction with the stomach, the of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fending lesion cut off and the end of the pylorus re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to its host. This he described as a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious remedy.

As Olive had</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne patiently with all her symptoms, she was the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady's favorite. Anne Rounsaville, having an analytical</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperament, recounted to Olive at every visit the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cise effect of soft food, of course breads, of acids, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bases and what not, on her pet ailment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hence, Dr. Jarvis was treading familiar ground in</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussing the various phases of this all too common</seg><seg type="columnLine">ailment.

Who would be interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">preventing a foreign loan? People, obviously, who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">either preparing a royalist coup or those who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">against all capital. They might be both scientists and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooks or they might be fanatics who imagined that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were destined to rescue mankind from capitalistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">woes, either real or fancied.

Not very obvious ones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may be sure. You said communists are active in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Molgravia.

In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning he walked to his garage and opened the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he threw it open, the odor of gasoline was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually strong. This struck him as peculiar. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the door of his car, a coupe, the odor became</seg><seg type="columnLine">very powerful. His eyes being observant, Dr. Jarvis</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted that the floor boards were not quite even. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pair of pliers he raised the floor boards. Beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the battery in its metal case. Following the odor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gasoline, he saw that the battery box was filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasoline. The long, thick cable which led to the starter</seg><seg type="columnLine">was resting clear of the battery box, but any motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the car would throw it against the metal box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, what would happen," the doctor asked him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, "if that cable were short circuited and sparked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point of contact with the box? It would be a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat spark and with the gas vapor confined, there would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a powerful explosion. The least I could hope for</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a few weeks in the hospital."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thanked his lucky stars that the leak of gas had</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred just a few weeks after he had installed a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable. But he lifted the cable clear very gingerly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he discovered that within the metal shield the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulation of the wire had been cut away for a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the cable. The moment he would have started the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car the cable would have been jarred to the metal box;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would have been a short circuit and an explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might have had any imaginable result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This incident set the doctor to thinking. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord, he tied up the cable to prevent it from making</seg><seg type="columnLine">a contact. With a large sponge, he began to remove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gasoline from the box. When this task was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted, he unscrewed the cable at the positive pole to</seg><seg type="columnLine">render it harmless. That his theory of the bank rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bery was the correct one he now had no doubt. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival in New York had been transmitted to the ring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaders who feared what he might discover.

When he heard Craven's voice, he said,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm coming to see you in a taxi, Inspector," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just had an accident to my car.

The doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not seen the bank, nor the safe, nor even young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bolton. But looking over the memoranda on his desk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw one item that had been placed there this very</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning.

Three rows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs had been placed in the space back of the tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers' cages and immediately to the front of the safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ATOMIC RIDDLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been robbed.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled as he entered the bank. Mr. Briscoe, the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ident of the bank, was there. Roger was there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded by two officers. Dr. Jarvis was standing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore his blackboard. There were four other individ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uals, Molgravians, in the room besides Frenchy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom Velie had insisted on accompanying Olive to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the demonstration.

Dr. Jarvis</seg><seg type="columnLine">was perhaps the only one, with the exception of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molgravians, who was unmoved. Frenchy Vergoyne</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned the doctor's inspection with contempt He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the professional type, this burglar. Huge, hulk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in body, about thirty-five, heavy jowled, cold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye, Vergoyne did not lack intelligence. His lips closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly, indicating habitual reticence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two of the Molgravians were more interesting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One, Doctor Jarvis noted, was a short thick set man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with dark, curly hair. His face was bronzed and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligent, but with an unmistakable air of the crafts-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. His hands were calloused, while around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nails could be seen scars of all kinds, from cuts or</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruises made by metals or tools. This Molgravian</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore the Americanized name of Grant Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other Molgravian who attracted the doctor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention met his eye with easy assurance. In phys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ique, he was frail, his shoulders narrow; he might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected of weak lungs. But the intellectual in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was so marked that Doctor Jarvis started. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wrists, Doctor Jarvis, an expert in all kinds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific apparatus, noted brown stains. In another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, he would have said they were signs of a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered liver. But from his own experience, he rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognized them for what they were--X-ray burns. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was known as Carlino Angulescu.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angulescu's forehead was somewhat rounded. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown eyes glowed with a light of self-sufficiency so</seg><seg type="columnLine">great that it held an assumption of regal or celestial</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorn. The aquiline nose, finely designed, face finely</seg><seg type="columnLine">moulded, convinced the doctor that if he sought an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual being among the Molgravians, he need search</seg><seg type="columnLine">no further.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing everyone looking expectantly at him, Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jarvis took his station before the blackboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Velie and gentlemen," he said, including even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchy Vergoyne in his bow, "I shall be as brief as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible in discussing the intricate matters which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring us together.

But if young Bolton took the money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why did he not take all? I learned that the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen was part of a sum intended to make up the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molgravian loan, which was recently financed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">America.

In a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle about the middle of this wall of the safe, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal showed the mark of some kind of tampering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently the metal had been cut with a tool of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some kind and sealed shut with another tool. A band</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a different color stood between the outer and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner lines of the cut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does it mean, Doc?" asked the Inspector,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaping with astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It means just this, my friends," said Doctor Jarvis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"a hole was cut into the side of this safe and sealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut. I believe we shall find another cut in the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the safe. The inside of that hole could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealed so well, but very few people would think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at the roof of the safe for an opening. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered a negligible matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door of the safe swung open. When a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thrown on the inside roof of the safe, there, sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, was the same sort of circular mark in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal as was seen on the side of the safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everybody now became thoroughly absorbed. Olive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Roger exchanged a glance of mutual relief. Tom</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Velie rubbed his eyes, saying, "Well, I'll be d-d."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Inspector Craven was in a fever Of impatience. Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">that confounded doctor intend to lecture all night</seg><seg type="columnLine">and possibly let the robbers, whoever they were, es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape? And what had become of the $100,000? After</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone had looked curiously at the marks on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe, Doctor Jarvis resumed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not believe it is necessary for me to prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">further, that this safe was opened on the night of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious disappearance of the $100,000. I shall pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceed to tell you how it was opened and how it was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">effectively sealed shut that for ordinary purposes it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have been discovered until the bank removed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bought a new safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A band of several men entered the bank that night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were equipped with oxyacetylene or oxyhydrogen</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus. One of the men, skilful in such work, drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circle of the cut he proposed to make. With his</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch he cut a disc in the side of the safe large</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to admit the body of a man. He performed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same operation.in the roof of the safe. He beveled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut so that the disc would not fall from the roof into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To answer possible objections, I must assume at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once that it would have been easier to cut around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the combination, but that would also have cut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumblers and they could not have been replaced. HaVr</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cut two regular holes in the safe, the sum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">$100,000 in notes was taken out and $10,000 in gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ignored. The next problem was to seal the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes shut so as to leave no obvious signs of the rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The robbers were provided with a quantity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. The disc which had been cut in the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe was first set in place. A narrow band of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was missing where the tool had burned through. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different kind of torch, the most trained worker of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the robbers now proceeded to fuse sufficient new metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to seal the opening into the space which had been cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the disc of metal and the wall of che safe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If only older methods of welding had been open to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbers, their plan to conceal the robbery would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ATOMIC RIDDLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been futile. But by using activated, or atomic hydro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gen at the point of fusion or welding, so great a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat was developed that the skilled worker had little</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty in making a neat job of it. When he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothed it off, there was practically no unevenness</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the surface of the safe. The paint had been marred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, but would such men be baffled by a paint</seg><seg type="columnLine">job?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now for a moment I must tax your patience with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a description of the instrument used for this purpose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is a welding torch with tungsten electrodes, ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged at an acute angle toward each other. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance apart is regulated by pressing a lever set</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the handle of the torch. The alternating current</seg><seg type="columnLine">from any socket would serve admirably for power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A tube passes through the handle and through this</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube flows a stream of hydrogen. This stream of hy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drogen passes through the electric arc, and is reduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to atoms. Passing through the arc, it is in the atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">state at the point of welding. Burning again to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">molecular state, it generates a heat that will fuse any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. As the reducing action of this atomic hydrogen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is so powerful, no carbon, oxygen or nitrogen con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tamination can occur. The weld can be made as clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smooth as desired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not to tire you further with occult science, I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply state then that the inside and outside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe were carefully sealed by means of this hydrogen</seg><seg type="columnLine">welding apparatus. The workman, who sealed the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">af the safe, was then lifted from the interior by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">confederates. They could do little with the inside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safe roof. The outside, however, was sealed up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with care. But who would look for safe-blowing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof of the safe?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If my long explanation leads to the supposition</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all this requires much time, Inspector Craven</seg><seg type="columnLine">will tell you that with the proper apparatus, the holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be cut in a few minutes. Welding with atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen can be done at the rate of fifty or more feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">per hour. While the explanation is involved, the exe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cution takes little time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Disgust was supreme on Inspector Craven's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">as this demonstration ended. So far as he could see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the doctor had shown was that there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">method by which a hole could be cut in a safe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hole sealed up again. The doctor seemed to read</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now that I have shown how this safe could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been robbed, my friend, Inspector Craven, is eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">for action. But I am merely a scientific theorist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">must indulge my bent into the realm of politics. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought the Inspector would take the story up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I ended. I know little of politics, but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">several men take so much trouble to hide their handi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, I reason there must be a correspondingly im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant motive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The only money these robbers took from the safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was $100,000, which formed part of a $50,000,000 loan</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Molgravia. Holding up any part of the loan, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, would be a temporary impediment. But if this</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbery were not discovered, a man of honor would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be accused of a breach of trust. Suppose the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing happened in New York and other large cities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the majority of the loan was distributed? A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The door of th© safe swung open. When a light was thrown on the In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side roof of the safe, there, 6urcj enough, was the same sort of circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark in the metal as seen on the side of the safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen trusted cashiers would be placed in jail, $50,-</seg><seg type="columnLine">000,000 would disappear and the Molgravian govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment would be discredited. Would that be worth a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">research into the realms of atomic hydrogen welding?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The doctor may well be pardoned for the little ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultation that appeared in his voice. His reasoning had</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been uncanny. But the doctor had ignored one very</seg><seg type="columnLine">important factor. The attempt on his automobile</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have taught him that men who plot schemes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such magnitude are resourceful and desperate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">«pUT 'em up everybody!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A This command came in curt fierce tones from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchy Vergoyne. Not being under arrest and being</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very accomplished criminal, he had picked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets of Inspector Craven and his two deputies, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieving them of their weapons and their watches. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pistols he now held in his hands. "Now all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get over there," he commanded. "And keep that</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirt in front of you. If anyone makes a move, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">will get it first." In all this time since his imprison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, Roger Bolton had been unable to make one</seg><seg type="columnLine">move on his own behalf. And at this critical moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">when those who had caused his disgrace seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be near capture, a determined and desperate burglar</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared to call the woman he loved, a skirt. It was en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely too much for Roger Bolton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Roger made one fierce lunge at the burglar, precisely</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had been in the habit of charging the line in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">college football days. Before Frenchy Vergoyne knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was happening, Roger struck him like a catapult.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He twisted the gun out of Vergoyne's right hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck up the other. The trigger fell, but the bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the ceiling. By this time Inspector Craven had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten into action and Frenchy Vergoyne was soon on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor, Inspector Craven astride his chest, with gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand. Frenchy Vergoyne d red not make a move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in the confusion, Carlino Angulescu, Grant Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">and two other Molgravians dashed through the iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">mesh door, which led from the rear of the tellers'</seg><seg type="columnLine">cages, closing it as they ran. Not daring to take his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes off Frenchy, Inspector Craven roared to his men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Follow them, round them up before they get out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Houston."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he turned to Frenchy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Frenchy," he said, with his gun to his pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner's face, "you or your gang killed one of our men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that New Brunswick robbery. No matter how I kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, there will be no blame attached to me. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men on the force will see to that. Tell me where that</seg><seg type="columnLine">loot is, or this gun will go off in a few seconds."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Frenchy did not want to die. In a low voice he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Inspector Craven that the sum of $100,000 in</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes was still intact under constant guard at an ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress in New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Roger," called the Inspector, "keep this gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained on Frenchy until I get a report. If he is ly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, he won't have long to worry over his troubles."</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a few seconds more Inspector Craven was tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phoning a police station near the New York address.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clancy," he cried to the lieutenant who answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telephone, "take the riot car and ten men fully</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">armed to No.-Avenue. You will find the loot from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Castile Bank and Trust Company robbery there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if my information is correct.

Frenchy Vergoyne, see-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that he was not kept under guard, walked from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room and resumed his journey to Chicago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Doctor," said Craven, somewhat repentantly, "I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">owe you an apology. I thought you were so fond of</seg><seg type="columnLine">science that you had forgotten all about our safe rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bery. You didn't mention it but I suppose they painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the place where they had cut the safe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, of course," said the doctor, "that was a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail. They had to repaint the entire surface of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the safe. But with a quick drying paint, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a simple matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Mr. Briscoe, "since the money has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovered and we know now who took it, I think the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers had better release Roger Bolton. We owe him</seg><seg type="columnLine">all kinds of amends, but what else could we do?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">When Clancy had arrived with his men and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen money, Inspector Craven ordered two to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">on guard until Mr. Briscoe had decided on a proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposition of the fund.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dr. Jarvis," cried Mr. Briscoe, as soon as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money had been counted, found intact and deposited in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the large vault in the basement, "the manner in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">you solved this intricate robbery is nothing short of</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvellous. We have an ample surplus in the bank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the insurance companies have offered a large re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward for the recovery of the stolen notes. The re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards belong to you, certainly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Briscoe," replied the doctor, diffidently, "to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole affair was a scientific problem to be solved</seg><seg type="columnLine">as such. My entire interest in this affair was due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the confidence Miss Velie had in this young man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her enthusiasm in my ability to help her. I may say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I count Roger Bolton a most fortunate man."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Olive blushed at this announcement, but confirmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor's opinion by pressing Roger's arm, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been locked in hers for some minutes. Tom Velie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide awake, said,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doc, the police force sure needs you if these burg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars are going in for invisible robberies.

Inspector Craven was offered a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">large reward, which he at first refused to take. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he found that Doctor Jarvis, who was very well</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, would have nothing to do with the reward, he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the bankers how the method of this robbery</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been discovered. With the aid of Tom Velie, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">endowed a million dollar laboratory at one of the hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitals, placing a large income at the disposal of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor for his experiments and researches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlino Angulescu, it was learned, was none other</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the scientist. Serge Malakieff, who had devoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his science to the cause of communism. He wrote</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Jarvis that he was prostituting his talents for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the benefit of capitalism, a decision he might sometime</seg><seg type="columnLine">regret. While the doctor recognized Malakieff's great</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability, he shrugged his shoulders at the notion of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat. At the same time he received an invitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Molgravian government, which had heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his achievement, to address the International Medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">Association, which was to meet in the Molgravian</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital the following year.

Only half an hour ago he had been feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">horribly bored. Here was employment the bare thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which was righteous self-applause.

He flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself down on the steeply sloping turf beside the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionless seated figure, and deployed forthwith into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirmishing line of gossip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hearer seemed to have lapsed into apathy; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared dismally seaward, and spoke only in answer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isbister's direct questions--and not to all of those.

Halfway up he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan talking to himself, and abruptly turned a ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">face on his helper. "What can be happening?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a gaunt illustrative hand. "What can be happen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing? Spin, spin, spin, spin.

At the headland they stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a space by the seat that looks into the dark mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teries of Blackapit, and then he sat down. Isbister</seg><seg type="columnLine">had resumed his talk whenever the path had widened</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently for them to walk abreast. He was enlarg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon the complex difficulty of making Boscastle Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bour in bad weather, when suddenly and quite irrel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evantly his companion interrupted him again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My head is not like what it was," he said, gesticu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating for want of expressive phrases.

He leant forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his brows on his hands and became motionless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he made a faint sound in his throat. Isbister</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved about the room with the nervousness of an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced host, making little remarks that scarcely re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired answering. He crossed the room to his portfolio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed it on the table and noticed the mantel clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know if you'd care to have supper with me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said with an unlighted cigarette in his hand--his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind troubled with a design of the furtive administra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of chloral. "Only cold mutton, you know, but pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sweet. Welsh. And a tart, I believe." He repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">this after momentary silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The seated man made no answer. Isbister stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">match in hand, regarding him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stillness lengthened. The match went out, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigarette was put down unlit. The man was certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">very still. Isbister took up the portfolio, opened it, put</seg><seg type="columnLine">it down, hesitated, seemed about to speak. "Perhaps,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he whispered doubtfully. Presently he glanced at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and back to the figure. Then he stole on tiptoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the room, glancing at his companion after each</seg><seg type="columnLine">elaborate pace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He closed the door noiselessly. The house door was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing open, and he went out beyond the porch, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood where the monkshood rose at the corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden bed. From this point he could see the stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the open window, still and dim, sitting head</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hand. He had not moved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A number of children going along the road stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and regarded the artist curiously. A boatman ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed civilities with him. He felt that possibly his</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumspect attitude and position seemed peculiar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaccountable. Smoking, perhaps, might seem more</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural. He drew pipe and pouch from his pocket, filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pipe slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder," ... he said, with a scarcely per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptible loss of complacency. "At any rate one must</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him a chance." He struck a match in the virile</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and proceeded to light his pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he heard his landlady behind him, coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his lamp lit from the kitchen. He turned, ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticulating with his pipe, and stopped her at the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his sitting-room. He had some difficulty in explain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the situation in whispers, for she did not know he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a visitor. She retreated again with the lamp, still a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little mystified to judge from her manner, and he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed his hovering at the comer of the porch, flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and less at his ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long after he had smoked out his pipe, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bats were abroad, his curiosity dominated his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plex hesitations, and he stole back into his darkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting-room. He paused in the doorway. The stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still in the same attitude, dark against the window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Save for the singing of some sailors aboard one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little slate-carrying ships in the harbour, the evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very still. Outside, the spikes of monkshood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">delphinium stood erect and motionless against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of the hillside. Something flashed into Isbister's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind; he started, and leaning over the table, listened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An unpleasant suspicion grew stronger; became convic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

This was Warming, a London solicitor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and next of kin to Graham the man who had fallen into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trance. And the two men stood side by side in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">room in a house in London regarding his recumbent</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a yellow figure lying lax upon a water-bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clad in a flowing shirt, a figure with a shrunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and a stubby beard, lean limbs and lank nails, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it was a case of thin glass. This glass seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark off the sleeper from the reality of life about him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was a thing apart, a strange, isolated abnormality.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two men stood close to the glass, peering in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The thing gave me a shock," said Isbister. "I feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">a queer sort of surprise even now when I think of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">white eyes. They were white, you know, rolled up. Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing here again brings it all back to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you never seen him since that time?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Often wanted to come," said Isbister; "but business</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowadays is too serious a thing for much holiday keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I've been in America most of the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I remember rightly," said Warming, "you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">an artist?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was. And then I became a married man. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was all up with black and white, very soon--at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a mediocre man; I jumped on to process. Those pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters on the Cliffs at Dover are by my people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good posters," admitted the solicitor, "though I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry to see them there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Last as long as the cliffs, if necessary," exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isbister with satisfaction. "The world changes. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fell asleep, twenty years ago, I was down at Boscastle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a box of water-colors and a noble, old-fashioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambition. I didn't expect that some day my pigments</seg><seg type="columnLine">would glorify the whole blessed coast of England, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Land's End round again to the Lizard. Luck comes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man very often when he's not looking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warming seemed to doubt the quality of the luck. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">just missed seeing you if I recollect aright."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You came back by the trap that took me to Camel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford railway station. It was close on the Jubilee, Vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toria's Jubilee, because I remember the seats and flags in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Westminster, and the row with the cabman at Chelsea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Diamond Jubilee, it was," said Warming; "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, yes! At the proper Jubilee--the Fifty Year</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair--I was down at Wookey--a boy. I missed all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. . . . What a fuss we had with him! My land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady wouldn't take him in, wouldn't let him stay--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked so queer when he was rigid. We had to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in a chair up to the hotel. And the Boscastle doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor--it wasn't the present chap, but the G.

"Here's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body, empty. Not dead a bit, and yet not alive. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a seat vacant and marked 'engaged.' No feeling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no digestion, no beating of the heart--not a flutter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That doesn't make me feel as if there was a man present.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a sense it's more dead than death, for these doctors</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me that even the hair has stopped growing. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the proper dead, the hair will go on growing--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," said Warming, with a flash of pain in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY peered through the glass again. Graham was</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed in a strange state, in the flaccid phase of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance, but a trance unprecedented in medical history.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trances had lasted for as much as a year before--but at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of that time it had ever been a waking or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">death; sometimes first one and then the other. Isbister</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted the marks the physicians had made in injecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">nourishment, for that device had been resorted to to</seg><seg type="columnLine">postpone collapse; he pointed them out to Warming, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been trying not to see them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And while he has been lying here," said Isbister,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the zest of a life freely spent, "I have changed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans in life; married, raised a family, my eldest lad--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hadn't begun to think of sons then--is an American</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizen, and looking forward to leaving Harvard. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a touch of grey in my hair.

He coughed primly. "As</seg><seg type="columnLine">it happens--I have charge of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" Isbister thought, hesitated and spoke: "No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt--his keep here is not expensive--no doubt it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have improved--accumulated ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has.

Who can trace its reintegra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion as morning after morning we awaken, the flux and</seg><seg type="columnLine">confluence of its countless factors interweaving, rebuild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the dim first stirrings of the soul, the growth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">synthesis of the unconscious to the sub-conscious, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sub-conscious to dawning consciousness, until at last we</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize ourselves again. And as it happens to most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us after the night's sleep so it was with Graham at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of his vast slumber. A dim cloud of sensation tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shape, a cloudy dreariness and he found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely somewhere, recumbent, faint, but alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pilgrimage towards a personal being seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">traverse vast gulfs, to occupy epochs. Gigantic dreams</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were terrible realities at the time, left vague per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexing memories, strange creatures, strange scenery, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if from another planet. There was a distinct impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, too, of a momentous conversation, of a name--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not tell what name--that was subsequently to recur,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some queer long-forgotten sensation of vein and</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle, of a feeling of vast hopeless effort, the effort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man near drowning in darkness. Then came a pano-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rama of dazzling unstable confluent scenes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham became aware his eyes were open and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding some unfamiliar thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was something white, the edge of something, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame of wood. He moved his head slightly, following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contour of this shape. It went up beyond the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his eyes. He tried to think where he might be. Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">it matter, seeing he was so wretched? The color of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts was a dark depression. He felt the feature-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less misery of one who wakes towards the hour of dawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had an uncertain sense of whispers and footsteps</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily receding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The movement of his head involved a perception of</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme physical weakness. He supposed he was in bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hotel at the place in the valley--but he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">recall that white edge. He must have slept. He remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered now that he had wanted to sleep. He recalled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff and waterfall again and then recollected something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about talking to a passer-by. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long had he slept? What was that sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pattering feet? And that rise and fall, like the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mur of breakers on pebbles? He put out a languid</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to reach his watch from the chair whereon it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his habit to place it, and touched some smooth, hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface like glass. This was so unexpected that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled him extremely. Quite suddenly he rolled over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared for a moment, and struggled into a sitting posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. The effort was unexpectedly difficult, and it left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him giddy and weak--and amazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rubbed his eyes. The riddle of his surroundings</seg><seg type="columnLine">was confusing but his mind was quite clear--evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sleep had benefitted him. He was not in a bed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all as he understood the word but lying naked on a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft and yielding mattress in a trough of dark glass. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mattress was partly transparent, a fact he observed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange sense of insecurity, and below it was a mirror</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflecting him greyly. About his arm--and he saw with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shock that his skin was strangely dry and yellow--was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound a curious apparatus of rubber, bound so cunningly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it seemed to pass into his skin above and below. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this strange bed was placed in a case of greenish colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass (as it seemed to him) a bar in the white frame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of which had first arrested his attention. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the case was a stand of glittering and deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cately made apparatus, for the most part quite strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">appliances, though a maximum and minimum thermom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eter was recognizable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slightly greenish tint of the glass-like substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">which surrounded him on every hand obscured what lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind but he perceived it was a vast apartment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid appearance, and with a very large and simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">white archway facing him. Close to the walls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cage were articles of furniture, a table covered with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">silvery cloth, silvery like the side of a fish, a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of graceful chairs, and on the table a number of dishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with substances piled on them, a bottle and two glasses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He realized that he was intensely hungry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could see no human being, and after a period of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitation scrambled off the translucent mattress and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to stand on the clean, white floor of his little apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. He had miscalculated his strength, however, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered and put his hand against the glass-like pane</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him to steady himself. For a moment it resisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand, bending outward like a distended bladder, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it broke with a slight report and vanished--a pricked</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubble. He reeled out into the general space of the hall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly astonished. He caught at the table to save him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, knocking one of the glasses to the floor--it rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">but did not break--and sat down in one of the arm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had a little recovered he filled the remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass from the bottle and drank--a colorless liquid it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, but not water, with a pleasing faint aroma and taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a quality of immediate support and stimulus. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">put down the vessel and looked about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The apartment lost none of its size and magnificence</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that the greenish transparency that had intervened</seg><seg type="columnLine">was removed. The archway he saw led to a flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, going downward without the intermediation of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, to a spacious transverse passage. This passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran between polished pillars of some white-veined sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance of deep ultramarine, and along it came the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of human movements and voices and a deep undeviating</seg><seg type="columnLine">droning note. He sat, now fully awake, listening alertly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgetting the viands in his attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then with a shock he remembered that he was naked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and casting about him for covering, saw a long black</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe thrown on one of the chairs beside him. This he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped about him and sat down again, trembling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His mind was still a surging perplexity. Clearly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had slept, and had been removed in his sleep. But where?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And who were those people, the distant crowd beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deep blue pillars? Boscastle? He poured out and par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tially drank another glass of the colorless fluid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was this place?--this place that to his senses</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed subtly quivering like a thing alive? He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him at the clean and beautiful form of the apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, unstained by ornament, and saw that the roof was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken in one place by a circular shaft full of light, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he looked, a steady, sweeping shadow blotted it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and passed, and came again and passed. "Beat, beat,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sweeping shadow had a note of its own in the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dued tumult that filled the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would have called out, but only a little sound came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his throat. Then he stood up, and, with the uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain steps of a drunkard, made his way towards the arch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. He staggered down the steps, tripped on the corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the black cloak he had wrapped about himself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved himself by catching at one of the blue pillars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passage ran down a cool vista of blue and purple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ended remotely in a railed space like a balcony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly lit and projecting into a space of haze, a space</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the interior of some gigantic building. Beyond and</seg><seg type="columnLine">remote were vast and vague architectural forms. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tumult of voices rose now loud and clear, and on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balcony and with their backs to him, gesticulating and</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently in animated conversation, were three figures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">richly dressed in loose and easy garments of bright soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">colorings. The noise of a great multitude of people</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured up over the balcony, and once it seemed the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a banner passed, and once some brightly colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">object, a pale blue cap or garment thrown up into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air perhaps, flashed athwart the space and fell. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts sounded like English, there was a reiteration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">''Wake!" He heard some indistinct shrill cry, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly these three men began laughing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed one--a red-haired man in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short purple robe. "When the Sleeper wakes--When!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned his eyes full of merriment along the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage. His face changed, the whole man changed, became</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid. The other two turned swiftly at his exclamation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood motionless. Their faces assumed an expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of consternation, an expression that deepened into</seg><seg type="columnLine">awe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Graham's knees bent beneath him, his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the pillar collapsed limply, he staggered forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell upon his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Sound of a Tumult</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GRAHAM'S last impression before he fainted was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a clamorous ringing of bells. He learnt after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards that he was insensible, hanging between life</seg><seg type="columnLine">and death, for the better part of an hour. When he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered his senses, he was back on his translucent couch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was a stirring warmth at heart and throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dark apparatus, he perceived, had been removed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm, which was bandaged. The white framework</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still about him, but the greenish transparent sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance that had filled it was altogetheiVone. A man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deep violet robe, one of those who Had been on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balcony, was looking keenly into his face.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Remote but insistent was a clamor of tells and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused sounds, that suggested to his mind the picture of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great number of people shouting together. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to fall across this tumult, a door suddeily closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham moved his head. "What does this all mean?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said slowly. "Where am I ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw the red-haired man who had been first to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover him. A voice seemed to be asking what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and was abruptly stilled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man in violet answered in a soft voice, speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">English with a slightly foreign accent, or so at least it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to the Sleeper's ears, "You are quite safe. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">were brought hither from where you fell asleep. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite safe. You have been here some time--sleeping.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a trance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said something further that Graham could not hear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little phial was handed across to him. Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a cooling spray, a fragrant mist played over his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head for a moment, and his sense of refreshment in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased. He closed his eyes in satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better?" asked the man in violet as Graham's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">reopened. He was a pleasant-faced man of thirty, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps, with a pointed flaxen beard, and a clasp of gold at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neck of his violet robe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have been asleep some time. In a cataleptic</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance. You have heard? Catalepsy? It may seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange to you at first, but I can assure you everything is</seg><seg type="columnLine">well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham did not answer, but these words served their</seg><seg type="columnLine">reassuring purpose. His eyes went from face to face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three people about him. They were regarding him</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely. He knew he ought to be somewhere in Corn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, but he could not square these things with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A matter that had been in his mind during his last</seg><seg type="columnLine">waking moments at Boscastle recurred, a thing resolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon and somehow neglected. He cleared his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you wired my cousin?" he asked. "E. Warm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, 27, Chancery Lane?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were all assiduous to hear. But he had to repeat</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. "What an odd blurr in his accent!" whispered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-haired man. "Wire, sir?" said the young man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flaxen beard, evidently puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He means send an electric telegram," volunteered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third, a pleasant-faced youth of nineteen or twenty. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaxen-bearded man gave a cry of comprehension. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid of me! You may be sure everything shall be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, sir," he said to Graham. "I am afraid it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult to--wire to your cousin. He is not in London</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. But don't trouble about arrangements yet; you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been asleep a very long time and the important</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing is to get over that, sir." (Graham concluded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word was sir, but this man pronounced it "Sire.")</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" said Graham, and became quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was all very puzzling, but apparently these people</seg><seg type="columnLine">in unfamiliar dress knew what they were about. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were odd and the room was odd. It seemed he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some newly established place. He had a sudden flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">of suspicion. Surely this wasn't some hall of public exhi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bition! If it was he would give Warming a piece of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. But it scarcely had that character. And in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of public exhibition he would not have discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself naked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly, quite abruptly, he realised what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. There was no perceptible interval of suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cion, no dawn to his knowledge. Abruptly he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trance had lasted for a vast interval; as if by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">processes of thought reading he interpreted the awe in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faces that peered into his. He looked at them</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely, full of intense emotion. It seemed they read</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes. He framed his lips to speak and could not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A queer impulse to hide his knowledge came into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind almost at the moment of his discovery. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at his bare feet, regarding them silently. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse to speak passed. He was trembling exceedingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They gave him some pink fluid with a greenish fluor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esence and a meaty taste and the assurance of returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength grew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That--that makes me feel better," he said hoarsely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were murmurs of respectful approval. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew now quite clearly. He made to speak again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again he could not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pressed his throat and tried a third time. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ?" he asked in a level voice. "How long have I been</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some considerable time," said the flaxen-bearded man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing quickly at the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A very long time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--yes," said Graham, suddenly testy. "But I want</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--	Is it--it is--some years? Many years? There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something--I forget what. I feel--confused. But you--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sobbed. "You need not fence with me. How long--?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped, breathing irregularly. He squeezed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes with his knuckles and sat waiting for an answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They spoke in undertones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Five or six?" he asked faintly. "More?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very much more than that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at them and it seemed as though imps were</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitching the muscles of his face. He looked his question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Many years," said the man with the red beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham struggled into a sitting position. He wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rheumy tear from his face with a lean hand. "Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">years!" he repeated. He shut his eyes tight, opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and sat looking about him from one unfamiliar</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How many years?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You must be prepared to be surprised."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"More than a gross of years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was irritated at the strange word. "More than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Two of them spoke together. Some quick remarks that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were made about "decimal" he did not catch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How long did you say?" asked Graham. "How long?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Don't look like that. Tell me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Among the remarks in an undertone, his ear caught</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">six words: "More than a couple of centuries."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What?" he cried, turning on the youth who he thought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had spoken. "Who says--? What was that? A couple</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of centuries!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," said the man with the red beard. "Two hundred</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Graham repeated the words. He had been prepared to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hear of a vast repose, and yet these concrete centuries</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">defeated him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Two hundred years," he said again, with the figure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of a great gulf opening very slowly in his mind; and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then, "Oh, but--!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They said nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You--did you say--?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Two hundred years. Two centuries of years," said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the man with the red beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a pause. Graham looked at their faces and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw that what he had heard was indeed true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But it can't be," he said querulously. "I am dream-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing. Trances. Trances don't last. That is not right--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this is a joke you have played upon me!

"I'm not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very strong in history, sir," he said weakly, and glanced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That was it, sir," said the youngster. "Boscastle, in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the old Duchy of Cornwall--it's in the southwest country</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beyond the dairy meadows.

He took the dose. It was almost immedi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ately sustaining. Directly he had taken it he began to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weep naturally and refreshingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Presently he looked at their faces, suddenly laughed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through his tears, a little foolishly. "But--two--hun--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dred--years!" he said. He grimaced hysterically and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">covered up his face again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">After a space he grew calm. He sat up, his hands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hanging over his knees in almost precisely the same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attitude in which Isbister had found him on the cliff at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pentargen. His attention was attracted by a thick domi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">neering voice, the footsteps of an advancing personage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What are you doing? Why, was I not warned? Surely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you could tell? Someone will suffer for this. The man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must be kept quiet. Are the doorways closed? All the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">doorways? He must be kept perfectly quiet. He must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not be told. Has he been told anything?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man with the fair beard made some inaudible</seg><seg type="columnLine">remark, and Graham, looking over his shoulder, saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching a very short, fat, and thickset beardless man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with aquiline nose and heavy neck and chin. Very thick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black and slightly sloping eyebrows that almost met</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his nose and overhung deep grey eyes, gave his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face an oddly formidable expression. He scowled mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentarily at Graham and then his regard returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man with the flaxen beard. "These others," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a voice of extreme irritation. "You had better go."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go?" said the red-bearded man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly--go now. But see the doorways are closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men addressed turned obediently, after one</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctant glance at Graham, and instead of going through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the archway as he expected, walked straight to the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the apartment opposite the archway. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a strange thing; a long strip of this apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid wall rolled up with a snap, hung over the two re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treating men and fell again, and immediately Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">was alone with the newcomer and the purple-robed man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the flaxen beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a space the thickset man took not the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice of Graham, but proceeded to interrogate the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">--obviously his subordinate--upon the treatment of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge. He spoke clearly, but in phrases only partially</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligible to Graham. The awakening seemed not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of surprise but of consternation and annoyance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. He was evidently profoundly excited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must not confuse his mind by telling him things,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he repeated again and again. "You must not confuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His questions answered, he turned quickly and eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the awakened sleeper with an ambiguous expression.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Feel queer?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The world, what you see of it, seems strange to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose I have to live in it, strange as it seems."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose so, now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"In the first place, hadn't I better have some clothes?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They--" said the thickset man and stopped, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaxen-bearded man met his eye and went away. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will very speedily have clothes," said the thickset man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it true indeed, that I have been asleep two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">--?" asked Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have told you that, have they? Two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and three, as a matter of fact."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham accepted the indisputable now with raised eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows and depressed mouth. He sat silent for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then asked a question, "Is there a mill or dynamo</seg><seg type="columnLine">near here?" He did not wait for an answer. "Things</seg><seg type="columnLine">have changed tremendously, I suppose?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is that shouting?" he asked abruptly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing," said the thickset man impatiently. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. You'll understand better later--perhaps. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">you say, things have changed." He spoke shortly, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows were knit, and he glanced about him like a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to decide in an emergency. "We must get you</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes and so forth, at any rate. Better wait here until</seg><seg type="columnLine">some can come. No one will come near you. You want</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaving."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham rubbed his chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man with the flaxen beard came back towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, turned suddenly, listened for a moment, lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyebrows at the older man, and hurried off through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">archway towards the balcony. The tumult of shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew louder, and the thickset man turned and listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">also. He cursed suddenly under his breath, and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes upon Graham with an unfriendly expression.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a surge of many voices, rising and falling, shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and screaming, and once came a sound like blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sharp cries, and then a snapping like the crackling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry sticks. Graham strained his ears to draw some single</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread of sound from the woven tumult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he perceived, repeated again and again, a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">formula. For a time he doubted his ears. But surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were the words: "Show us the Sleeper! Show</seg><seg type="columnLine">us the Sleeper!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thickset man rushed suddenly to the archway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wild!" he cried, "How do they know? Do they know?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or is it guessing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was perhaps an answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't come," said the thickset man; "I have him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see to. But shout from the balcony."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an inaudible reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say he is not awake. Anything! I leave it to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came hurrying back to Graham. "You must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes at once," he said. "You cannot stop here--and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be impossible to--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rushed away, Graham shouting unanswered ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions after him. In a moment he was back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't tell you what is happening. It is too complex</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain. In a moment you shall have your clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. Yes--in a moment. And then I can take you</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from here. You will find out our troubles soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But those voices. They were shouting--?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something about the Sleeper--that's you. They have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some twisted idea. I don't know what it is. I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shrill bell jetted acutely across the indistinct min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling of remote noises, and this brusque person sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a little group of appliances in the corner of the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie listened for a moment, regarding a ball of crystal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded, and said a few indistinct words; then he walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wall through which the two men had vanished. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled up again like a curtain, and he stood waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham lifted his arm and was astonished to find what</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength the restoratives had given him. He thrust one</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg over the side of the couch and then the other. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">head no longer swam. He could scarcely credit his rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovery. He sat feeling his limbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man with the flaxen beard re-entered from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">archway, and as he did so the cage of a lift came sliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in front of the thickset man, and a lean, grey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearded man, carrying a roll, and wearing a tightly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitting costume of dark green, appeared therein.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the tailor," said the thickset man with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">introductory gesture. "It will never do for you to wear</seg><seg type="columnLine">that black. I cannot understand how it got here. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shall. I shall. You will be as rapid as possible?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to the tailor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man in green bowed, and, advancing, seated him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self by Graham on the bed. His manner was calm, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes were full of curiosity. "You will find the fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions altered, Sire," he said. He glanced from under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows at the thickset man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE OPENED the roller with a quick movement, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion of brilliant fabrics poured out over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees. "You lived, Sire, in a period essentially cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drical--the Victorian. With a tendency to the hemi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere in hats. Circular curves always. Now--" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicked out a little appliance the size and appearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a keyless watch, whirled the knob, and behold--a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure in white appeared kinetoscope fashion on the dial,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking and turning. The tailor caught up a pattern of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish white satin. "That is my conception of your im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediate treatment," he said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thickset man came and stood by the shoulder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have very little time," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trust me," said the tailor. "My machine follows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What do you think of this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is that?" asked the man from the nineteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">century.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In your days they showed you a fashion-plate," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tailor, "but this is our modern development. See</seg><seg type="columnLine">here." The little figure repeated its revolutions but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different costume. "Or this," and with a click another</seg><seg type="columnLine">small figure in a more voluminous type of robe marched</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to the dial. The tailor was very quick in his move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, and glanced twice towards the lift as he did these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It rumbled again, and a crop-haired anaemic lad with</seg><seg type="columnLine">features of the Chinese type, clad in coarse pale blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas, appeared together with a complicated machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he pushed noiselessly on little castors into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Incontinently the little kinetoscope was dropped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham was invited to stand in front of the machine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tailor muttered some instructions to the crop-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad, who answered in guttural tones and with words</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham did not recognize. The boy then went to conduct</seg><seg type="columnLine">an incomprehensible monologue in the corner, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailor pulled out a number of slotted arms terminat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in little discs, pulling them out until the discs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat against the body of Graham, one at each shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade, one at the elbows one at the neck and so forth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that at last there were, perhaps, two score of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his body and limbs. At the same time, some other</seg><seg type="columnLine">person entered the room by the lift behind Graham. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailor set moving a mechanism that initiated a faint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounding rhythmic movement of parts in the machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in another moment he was knocking up the levers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Graham was released. The tailor replaced his cloak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of black, and the man with the flaxen beard proffered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little glass of some refreshing fluid. Graham saw over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rim of the glass a pale-faced young man regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a singular fixity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thickset man had been pacing the room fretfully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now turned and went through the archway towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balcony from which the noise of a distant crowd still</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in gusts and cadences. The crop-headed lad handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tailor a roll of the bluish satin and the two began</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixing this in the mechanism in a manner reminiscent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a roll of paper in a nineteenth century printing machine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they ran the entire thing on its easy, noiseless bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings across the room to a remote corner where a twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable looped rather gracefully from the wall. They made</seg><seg type="columnLine">some connection and the machine became energetic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is that doing?" asked Graham, pointing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the empty glass to the busy figures and trying to ignore</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scrutiny of the newcomer. "Is that--some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">force--laid on?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes" said the man with the flaxen beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is that?" He indicated the archway behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man in purple stroked his little beard, hesitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and answered in an undertone, "He is Howard, your chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardian. You see Sire,--it's a little difficult to explain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Council appoints a guardian and assistants. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall has under certain restrictions been public. In order</seg><seg type="columnLine">that people might satisfy themselves. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred the doorways for the first time. But I think--if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you don't mind, I will leave him to explain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Odd!" said Graham. "Guardian? Council?" Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning his back on the newcomer, he asked in an under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone, "Why is this man glaring at me? Is he a mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merist?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mesmerist! He is a capillotomist."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Capillotomist!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--one of the chief. His yearly fee is sixdoz lions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It sounded sheer nonsense. Graham snatched at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">last phrase with an unsteady mind. "Sixdoz lions?" he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't you have lions? I suppose not. You had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old pounds? They are our monetary units."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what was that you said--sixdoz?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Six dozen, Sire. Of course things, even these</seg><seg type="columnLine">little things, have altered. You lived in the days of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decimal system, the Arab system--tens, and little hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds and thousands. We have eleven numerals now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have single figures for both ten and eleven, two fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures for a dozen, and a dozen dozen makes a gross, a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred, you know, a dozen gross a dozand, and a dozand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozand a myriad. Very simple?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose so," said Graham. "But about this cap--</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man with the flaxen beard glanced over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here are your clothes!" he said. Graham turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">round sharply and saw the tailor standing at his elbow</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling, and holding some palpably new garments over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm. The crop-headed boy, by means of one finger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impelling the complicated machine towards the lift</seg><seg type="columnLine">by which he had arrived. Graham stared at the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted suit. "You don't mean to say--!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just made," said the tailor. He dropped the gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments at the feet of Graham, walked to the bed on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham had so recently been lying, flung out the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucent mattress, and turned up the looking-glass. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so a furious bell summoned the thickset man to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. The man with the flaxen beard rushed across to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and then hurried out by the archway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tailor was assisting Graham into a dark purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">combination garment, stockings, vest, and pants in one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the thickset man came back from the corner to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man with the flaxen beard returning from the bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cony. They began speaking quickly in an undertone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bearing had an unmistakable quality of anxiety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Over the purple under-garment came a complex but grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful garment of bluish white, and Graham was clothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fashion once more and saw himself, sallow-faced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unshaven and shaggy still, but at least naked no longer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in some indefinable unprecedented way graceful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must shave," he said regarding himself in the glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a moment," said Howard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The persistent stare ceased. The young man closed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, reopened them, and with a lean hand extended, ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced on Graham. Then he stopped, with his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly gesticulating, and looked about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A seat," said Howard impatiently and in a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flaxen-bearded man had a chair behind Graham.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sit down, please," said Howard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham hesitated, and in the other hand of the wild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed man he saw the glint of steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you understand, Sire?" cried the flaxen-bearded</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with hurried politeness. "He is going to cut your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" cried Graham enlightened. "But you called</seg><seg type="columnLine">him--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A capillotomist--precisely! He is one of the finest</seg><seg type="columnLine">artists in the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham sat down abruptly. The flaxen-bearded man</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared. The capillotomist came forward with grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful gestures, examined Graham's ears and surveyed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the back of his head, and would have sat down again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to regard him but for Howard's audible impatience.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forthwith with rapid movements and a succession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">deftly handled implements he shaved Graham's chin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clipped his moustache, and cut and arranged his hair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All this he did without a word, with something of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapt air of a poet inspired. And as soon as he had fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, Graham was handed a pair of shoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly a loud voice shouted--it seemed from a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of machinery in the corner-- "At once--at once. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">people know all over the city. Work is being stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Work is being stopped. Wait for nothing, but come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This shout appeared to perturb Howard exceedingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By his gestures it seemed to Graham that he hesitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two directions. Abruptly he went towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner where the apparatus stood about the little crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball. As he did so the undertone of tumultuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting from the archway that had continued during</seg><seg type="columnLine">all these occurrences rose to a mighty sound, roared as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it were sweeping past, and fell again as if receding</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly. It drew Graham after it with an irresistible</seg><seg type="columnLine">attraction. He glanced at the thickset man, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed his impulse. In two strides he was down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps and in the passage, and in a score he was out upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balcony upon which the three men had been standing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Moving Ways</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE went to the railings of the balcony and stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward. An exclamation of surprise at his ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance, and the movements of a number of peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple came from the spacious area below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His first impression was of overwhelming architecture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The place into which he looked was an aisle of Titanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings, curving spaciously in either direction. Over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head mighty cantilevers sprang together across the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">width of the place, and a tracery of translucent material</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut out the sky. Gigantic globes of cool white light</seg><seg type="columnLine">shamed the pale sunbeams that filtered down through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girders and wires. Here and there a gossamer suspen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion bridge dotted with foot passengers flung across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chasm and the air was webbed with slender cables. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff of edifice hung above him, he perceived as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced upward, and the opposite facade was grey and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim and broken by great archings, circular perforations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">balconies, buttresses, turret projections, myriads of vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows, and an intricate scheme of architectural relief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Athwart these ran inscriptions horizontally and obliquely</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an unfamiliar lettering. Here and there close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof cables of a peculiar stoutness were fastened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped in a steep curve to circular openings on the oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site side of the space, and even as Graham noted these a</seg><seg type="columnLine">remote and tiny figure of a man clad in pale blue arrested</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention. This little figure was far overhead across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space beside the higher fastening of one of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">festoons, hanging forward from a little k.lge of masonry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and handling some well-nigh invisible strings dependent</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the line. Then suddenly, with a swoop that sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham's heart into his mouth this man had rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the curve and vanished through a round opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the hither side of the way. Graham had been looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up as he came out upon the balcony, and the things he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw above and opposed to him had at first seized his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the exclusion of anything else. Then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly he discovered the roadway! It was not a roadway</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all, as Graham understood such things, for in the nine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teenth century the only roads and streets were beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks of motionless earth, jostling rivulets of vehicles</seg><seg type="columnLine">between narrow footways. But this roadway was three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet across, and it moved; it moved, all save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle, the lowest part. For a moment, the motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazzled his mind. Then he understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under the balcony this extraordinary roadway ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly to Graham's right, an endless flow rushing along</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fast as a nineteenth century express train, an endless</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform of narrow transverse overlapping slats with</seg><seg type="columnLine">little interspaces that permitted it to follow the curva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of the street. Upon it were seats, and here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there little kiosks, but they swept by too swiftly for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see what might be therein. From this nearest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftest platform a series of others descended to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">centre of the space. Each moved to the right, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceptibly slower than the one above it, but the differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence in pace was small enough to permit anyone to step</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">You must come av/ay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from any platform to the one adjacent, and so walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">uninterruptedly from the swiftest to the motionless mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle way. Beyond this middle way was another series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">endless platforms rushing with varying pace to Graham's</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. And seated in crowds upon the two widest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftest platforms, or stepping from one to another down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps, or swarming over the central space, was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">innumerable and wonderfully diversified multitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must not stop h.ere," shouted Howard suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side. "You must come away at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham made no answer. He heard without hearing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The platforms ran with a roar and the people were shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He perceived women and girls with flowing hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautifully robed, with bands crossing between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breasts. These first came out of the confusion. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he perceived that the dominant note in that kaleidoscope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of costume was the pale blue that the tailor's boy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn. He became aware of cries of "The Sleeper. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">has happened to the Sleeper?" and it seemed as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rushing platforms before him were suddenly spattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the pale buffi of human faces, and then still more</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly. He saw pointing fingers. He perceived that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motionless central area of this huge arcade just</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite to the balcony was densely crowded with blue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad people. Some sort of struggle had sprung into life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">People seemed to be pushed up the running platforms on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side, and carried away against their will. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would spring off so soon as they were beyond the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the confusion, and run back towards the conflict.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the Sleeper. Verily it is the Sleeper," shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices. "That is never the Sleeper," shouted others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More and more faces were turned to him. At the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervals along this central area Graham noted openings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pits, apparently the heads of staircases going down with</seg><seg type="columnLine">people ascending out of them and descending into them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The struggle it seemed centered about the one of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest to him. People were running down the moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">platforms to this, leaping dexterously from platform to</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform. The clustering people on the higher platforms</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to divide their interest between this point and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balcony. A number of sturdy little figures clad in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform of bright red, and working methodically to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, were employed it seemed in preventing access to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this descending staircase. About them a crowd was rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly accumulating. Their brilliant color contrasted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vividly with the whitish-blue of their antagonists, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle was indisputable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw these things with Howard shouting in his ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shaking his arm. And then suddenly Howard was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone and he stood alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He perceived that the cries of "The Sleeper!" grew in</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume, and that the people on the nearer platform were</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing up. The nearer, swifter platform he perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">was empty to the right of him, and far across the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform running in the opposite direction was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing crowded and passing away bare. With incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftness a vast crowd had gathered in the central space</seg><seg type="columnLine">before his eyes; a dense swaying mass of people, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shouts grew from a fitful crying to a voluminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">incessant clamor: "The Sleeper! The Sleeper!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yells and cheers, a waving of garments and cries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stop the ways!" They were also crying another name</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange to Graham. It sounded like "Ostrog." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">slower platforms were soon thick with active people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">running against the movement so as to keep themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop the ways," they cried. Agile figures ran up</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly from the centre to the swift road nearest to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were borne rapidly past him, shouting strange, unin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligible things, and ran back obliquely to the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. One thing he distinguished: "It is indeed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleeper. It is indeed the Sleeper," they testified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a space Graham stood without a movement. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he became vividly aware that all this concerned him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pleased at his wonderful popularity, he bowed, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking a gesture of longer range, waved his arm. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished at the violence of uproar that this provoked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tumult about the descending stairway rose to furious</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence. He became aware of crowded balconies, of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding along ropes, of men in trapeze-like seats hurling</seg><seg type="columnLine">athwart the space. He heard voices behind him, a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of people descending the steps through the archway;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he suddenly perceived that his guardian Howard was</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again and gripping his arm painfully, and shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing inaudibly in his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned, and Howard's face was white. "Come back."</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard. "They will stop the ways. The whole city will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in confusion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He perceived a number of men hurrying along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage of blue pillars behind Howard, the red-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, the man with the flaxen beard, a tall man in vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">vermilion, a crowd of others in red carrying staves, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all these people had anxious eager faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get him away," cried Howard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why?" said Graham. "I don't see--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must come away!" said the man in red in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolute voice. His face and eyes were resolute, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham's glances went from face to face, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly aware of that most disagreeable flavor in life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">compulsion. Some one gripped his arm. ... He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being dragged away. It seemed as though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumult suddenly became two, as if half the shouts that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come in from this wonderful roadway had sprung</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the passages of the great building behind him. Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velling and confused, feeling an impotent desire to resist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham was half led, half thrust, along the passage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue pillars, and suddenly he found himself alone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howard in a lift and moving swiftly upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Hall of the Atlas</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FROM the moment when the tailor had bowed his fare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well to the moment when Graham found himself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift, was altogether barely five minutes. And as yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the haze of his vast interval of sleep hung about him, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet the initial strangeness of his being alive at all in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">remote age touched everything with wonder, with a sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the irrational, with something of the quality of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">realistic dream. He was still detached, an astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectator, still but half involved in life. What he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, and especially the last crowded tumult, framed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the setting of the balcony, had a spectacular turn, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing witnessed from the box of a theatre. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand," he said. "What was the trouble? My mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in a whirl. Why were they shouting? What is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have our troubles," said Howard. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided Graham's inquiry. "This is a time of unrest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, in fact, your appearance, your waking just now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">has a sort of connection--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke jerkily, like a man not quite sure of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing. He stopped abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't understand," said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will be clearer later," said Howard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced uneasily upward, as though he found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress of the lift slow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall understand better, no doubt, when I have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way about a little," said Graham puzzled. "It will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be--it is bound to be perplexing. At present it is all so</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange. Anything seems possible. Anything. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">details even. Your counting, I understand, is different."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lift stopped, and they stepped out into a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">but very long passage between high walls, along which</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran an extraordinary number of tubes and big cables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a huge place this is!" said Graham. "Is it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">one building? What place is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is one of the city ways for various public serv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ices. Light and so forth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was it a social trouble--that--in the great roadway</seg><seg type="columnLine">place? How are you governed? Have you still a</seg><seg type="columnLine">police?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Several," said Howard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Several?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About fourteen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't understand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very probably not. Our social order will probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem very complex to you. To tell you the truth I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand it myself very clearly. Nobody does. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will perhaps--bye and bye. We have to go to the Coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cil."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham's attention was divided between the urgent</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity of his inquiries and the people in the passages</seg><seg type="columnLine">and halls they were traversing. For a moment his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be concentrated upon Howard and the halting</seg><seg type="columnLine">answers he made, and then he would lose the thread in</seg><seg type="columnLine">response to some vivid unexpected impression. Along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passages, in the halls, half the people seemed to be men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the red uniform. The pale blue canvas that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so abundant in the aisle of moving ways did not appear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Invariably these men looked at him, and saluted him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howard as they passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had a clear vision of entering a long corridor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were a number of girls sitting on low seats and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though in a class. He saw no teacher, but only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">novel apparatus from which he fancied a voice pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded. The girls regarded him ;'od his conductor, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, with curiosity and astonishment. But he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried on before he could form, a clear idea of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering. He judged they knew Howard and not him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and that they wondered who he was. This Howard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed, was a person of importance. But then he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">also merely Graham's Guardian. That was odd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a passage in twilight, and into this pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage a footway hung so that he could see the feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankles of people going to and fro thereon but no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. Then vague impressions of galleries and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">casual astonished passers-by turning around to stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the two of them with their red-clad guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stimulus of the restoratives he had taken was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only temporary. He was speedily fatigued by this ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessive haste. He asked Howard to slacken his speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently he was in a lift that had a window upon the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">great street space, but this was glazed and did not open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were too high for him to see the moving plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms below. But he saw people going to and fro along</seg><seg type="columnLine">cables and along strange, frail-looking bridges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thence they passed across the street and at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast height above it. They crossed by means of a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge closed in with glass, so clear that it made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">giddy even to remember it. The floor of it also was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass. From his memory of the cliffs between New Quay</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Boscastle, so remote in time, and so recent in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience, it seemed to him that they must be near four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet above the moving ways. He stopped, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down between his legs upon the swarming blue and red</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitudes, minute and fore-shortened, struggling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesticulating still towards the little balcony far below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little toy balcony, it seemed, where he had so recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">been standing. A thin haze and the glare of the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes of light obscured everything. A man seated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little open-work cradle shot by from some point still</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher than the little narrow bridge, rushing down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable as swiftly almost as if he were falling. Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped involuntarily to watch this strange passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanish in a great circular opening below, and then his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes went back to the tumultuous struggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Along one of the swifter ways rushed a thick crowd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">red spots. This broke up into individuals as it approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balcony, and went pouring down the slower ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the dense struggling crowd on the central area.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These men in red appeared to be armed with sticks or</seg><seg type="columnLine">truncheons; they seemed to be striking and thrusting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A great shouting, cries of wrath, screaming, burst out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came up to Graham, faint and thin. "Go on," cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howard, laying hands on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another man rushed down a cable. Graham suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up to see whence he came, and beheld through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glassy roof and the network of cables and girders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim rhythmically passing forms like the vans of wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mills, and between them glimpses of a remote and pallid</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. Then Howard had thrust him forward across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge, and he was in a little narrow passage decorated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with geometrical patterns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to see more of that," cried Graham, resisting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no," cried Howard, still gripping his arm. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. You must go this way." And the men in red fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing them seemed ready to enforce his orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some negroes in a curious wasp-like uniform of black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yellow appeared down the passage and one hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to throw up a sliding shutter that had seemed a door to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham, and led the way through it. Graham found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in a gallery overhanging the end of a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber. The attendant in black and yellow crossed this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust up a second shutter and stood waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS place had the appearance of an ante-room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a number of people in the central space, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite end a large and imposing doorway at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of a flight of steps, heavily curtained but giving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of some still larger hall beyond. He perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men in red and other negroes in black and yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing stiffly about those portals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they crossed the gallery he heard a whisper from</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, "The Sleeper," and was aware of a turning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads, a hum of observation. They entered another little</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage in the wall of this ante-chamber, and then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself on an iron-railed gallery of metal that</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed round the side of the great hall he had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen through the curtains. He entered the place at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner, so that he received the fullest impression of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge proportions. The black in the wasp uniform stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside like a well-trained servant, and closed the valve</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Compared with any of the places Graham had seen thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">far, this second hali appeared to be decorated with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treme richness. On a pedestal at the remoter end, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">more brilliantly lit than any other object, was a gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">white figure of Atlas, strong and strenuous, the globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his bowed shoulders. It was the first thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike his attention, it was so vast, so patiently and pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully real, so white and simple. Save for this figure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a dais in the centre, the wide floor of the place was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining vacancy. The dais was remote in the greatness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the area; it would have looked a mere slab of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it not been for the group of seven men who stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a table on it, and gave an inkling of its proportions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were all dressed in white robes, they seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">arisen that moment from their seats, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding Graham steadfastly. At the end of the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">he perceived the glitter of some mechanical appliances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Howard led him along the end gallery until they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite this mighty laboring figure. Then he stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two men in red who had followed them into the gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lery came and stood on either hand of Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must remain here," murmured Howard, "for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments," and, without waiting for a reply, hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">away along the gallery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, why--?" began Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved as if to follow Howard, and found his path</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstructed by one of the men in red. "You have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait here, Sire," said the man in red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">-Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Orders, Sire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Whose orders?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Our orders, Sire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Graham looked his exasperation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What place is this?" he said presently. "Who are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">those men?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"They are the lords of the Council, Sire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What Council?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The Council."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh!" said Graham, and after an equally ineffectual</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attempt at the other man, went to the railing and stared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the distant men in white, who stood watching him and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whispering together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Council? He perceived there were now eight,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">though how the newcomer had arrived he had not ob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">served. They made no gestures of greeting; they stood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">regarding him as in the nineteenth century a group of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men might have stood in the street regarding a distant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">balloon that had suddenly floated into view. What council</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could it be that gathered there, that little body of men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beneath the significant white Atlas, secluded from every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eavesdropper in this impressive spaciousness? And why</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should he be brought to them, and be looked at strangely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and spoken of inaudibly? Howard appeared beneath,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham saw the white robed council still standing In a elose group.</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">walking quickly across the polished floor towards them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As he drew near he bowed and performed certain peculiar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">movements, apparently of a ceremonious nature. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he ascended tho steps of the dais, and stood by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">apparatus at the end of the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham watched that visible inaudible conversation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Occasionally, one of the white-robed men would glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward? him. He strained his ears in vain. The gesticu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation of two of the speakers became animated. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced from them to the passive faces of his attend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants. . . . When he looked again Howard was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tending his hands and moving his head like a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">protests. He was interrupted, it seemed, by one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-robed men rapping the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conversation lasted an interminable time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham's sense. His eyes rose to the still giant at whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet the Council sat. Thence they wandered at last to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls of the hall. It was decorated in long painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">panels of a quasi-Japanese type many of them very beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful. These panels were grouped in a great and elabo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate framing of dark metal, which passed into the metal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic caryatidae of the galleries, and the great structural</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of the interior. The facile grace of these panels</seg><seg type="columnLine">enhanced the mighty white effort that labored in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">centre of the scheme. Graham's eyes came back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council, and Howard was descending the steps. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew nearer, his features could be distinguished, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham saw that he was flushed and blowing out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks. His countenance was still disturbed when pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently he reappeared along the gallery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This way," he said concisely, and they went on in</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence to a little door that opened at their approach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two men in red stopped on either side of this door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howard and Graham passed in, and Graham, glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, saw the white-robed Council still standing in a close</seg><seg type="columnLine">group and looking at him. Then the door closed behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a heavy thud, and for the first time since his</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakening he was in silence. The floor, even, was noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Howard opened another door, and they were in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two contiguous chambers furnished in white and green.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What Council was that?" began Graham. "What were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they discussing? What have they to do with me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howard closed the door carefully, heaved a huge sigh, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said something in an undertone. He walked slantingways</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the room and turned, blowing out his cheeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. "Ugh!" he grunted, a man relieved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham stood regarding him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must understand," began Howard abruptly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoiding Graham's eyes, "that our social order is very</seg><seg type="columnLine">complex. A half explanation, a bare unqualified state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment would give you false impressions. As a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact--it is a case of compound interest partly--your</seg><seg type="columnLine">small fortune, and the fortune of your cousin Warming</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was left to you--and certain other beginnings--</seg><seg type="columnLine">have become very considerable. And in other ways that</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be hard for you to understand, you have become a</seg><seg type="columnLine">person of significance--of very considerable significance</seg><seg type="columnLine">--involved in the world's affairs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes?" said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have grave social troubles."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Things have come to such a pass that, in fact, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">advisable to seclude you here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep me prisoner!" exclaimed Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--to ask you to keep in seclusion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham turned on him.

He remained sitting for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time with folded arms and knitted brow, biting his finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">nails and trying to piece together the kaleidoscopic im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressions of this first hour of awakened life; the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical spaces, the endless series of chambers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passages, the great struggle that roared and splashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through these strange ways, the little group of remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsympathetic men beneath the colossal Atlas, Howard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious behavior. There was an inkling of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast inheritance already in his mind--a vast inheritance</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps misapplied--of some unprecedented importance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opportunity. What had he to do? And this room's</seg><seg type="columnLine">secluded silence was eloquent of imprisonment!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_ It came into Graham's mind with irresistible convic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that this series of magnificent impressions was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream. He tried to shut his eyes and succeeded, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time-honored device led to no awakening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he began to touch and examine all the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar appointments of the two small rooms in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a long oval panel of mirror he saw himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped astonished. He was clad in a graceful costume</seg><seg type="columnLine">of purple and bluish white, with a little greyshot beard</seg><seg type="columnLine">trimmed to a point, and his hair, its blackness streaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">now with bands of grey, arranged over his forehead in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unfamiliar but graceful manner. He seemed a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">five-and-forty perhaps. For a moment he did not per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive this was himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A flash of laughter came with the recognition. "To</seg><seg type="columnLine">call on old Warming like this!" he exclaimed, "and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">him take me out to lunch!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he thought of meeting first one and then another</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the few familiar acquaintances of his early manhood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the midst of his amusement realized that every</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul with whom he might jest had died many score of</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago. The thought smote him abruptly and keenly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stopped short, the expression of his face changed to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white consternation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tumultuous memory of the moving platforms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge facade of that wonderful street reasserted itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The shouting multitudes came back clear and vivid, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">those remote, inaudible, unfriendly councillors in white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt himself a little figure, very small and ineffectual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pitifully conspicuous. And all about him, the world was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--strange</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Silent Rooms</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PRESENTLY Graham resumed his examination of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartments. Curiosity kept him moving in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fatigue. The inner room, he perceived, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">high, and its ceiling dome shaped, with an oblong aper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture in the centre, opening into a funnel in which a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel of broad vans seemed to be rotating, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving the air up the shaft. The faint humming note</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its easy motion was the only clear sound in that quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. As these vans sprang up one after the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham could get transient glimpses of the sky. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surprised to see a star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This drew his attention to the fact that the bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighting of these rooms was due to a multitude of very</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint glow lamps set about the cornices. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows. And he began to recall that along all the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">chambers and passages he had traversed with Howard</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had observed no windows at all. Had there been win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows? There were windows on the street indeed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">were they for light? Or was the whole city lit day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">night for evermore, so that there was no night there?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And another thing dawned upon him. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fireplace in either room. Was the season summer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were these merely summer apartments, or was the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">city uniformly heated or cooled? He became interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">in these questions, began examining the smooth texture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the walls, the simply constructed bed, the ingenious</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangements by which the labor of bedroom service</seg><seg type="columnLine">was practically abolished. And over everything was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious absence of deliberate ornament, a bare grace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">form and color, that he found very pleasing to the eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were several very comfortable chairs, a light table</seg><seg type="columnLine">on silent runners carrying several bottles of fluids and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses, and two plates bearing a clear substance like</seg><seg type="columnLine">jelly. Then he noticed there were no books, no news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers, no writing materials. "The world has changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He observed one entire side of the outer room was set</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rows of peculiar double cylinders inscribed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">green lettering on white that harmonized with the deco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rative scheme of the room, and in the centre of this side</seg><seg type="columnLine">projected a little apparatus about a yard square and</seg><seg type="columnLine">having a white smooth face to the room. A chair faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. He had a transitory idea that these cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be books, or a modern substitute for books, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first it did not seem so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lettering on the cylinders puzzled him. At first</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight it seemed like Russian. Then he noticed a sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of mutilated English about certain of the words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"©i Man huwdbi Kiti,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forced itself on him as "The Man who would be King."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Phonetic spelling," he said. He remembered reading a</seg><seg type="columnLine">story with that title, then he recalled the story vividly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the best stories in the world. But this thing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him was not a book as he understood it. He puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the titles of two adjacent cylinders. 'The Heart of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Darkness,' he had never heard of before nor 'The Madon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">na of the Future'--no doubt if they were indeed stories,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were by post Victorian authors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He puzzled over this peculiar cylinder for some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and replaced it. Then he turned to the square appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus and examined that. He opened a sort of lid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found one of the double cylinders within and on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper edge a little stud like the stud of an electric bell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pressed this and a rapid clicking began and ceased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He became aware of voices and music, and noticed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">play of color on the smooth front face. . He suddenly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">realized what this might be, and stepped back to regard it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the flat surface was now a little picture, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">vividly colored, and in this picture were figures that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved. Not only did they move, but they were convers-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in clear small voices. It was exactly like reality</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed through an inverted opera glass and heard through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long tube. His interest was seized at once by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation, which presented a man pacing up and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vociferating angry things to a pretty but petulant</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. Both were in the picturesque costume that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed so strange to Graham. "I have worked," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man, "but what have you been doing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" said Graham. He forgot everything else, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down in the chair. Within five minutes he heard him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self named, heard "when the Sleeper wakes," used jest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly as a proverb for remote postponement, and passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself by, a thing remote and incredible. But in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little while he knew those two people like intimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the miniature drama came to an end, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">square face of the apparatus was blank again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a strange world into which he had been per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted to see, unscrupulous, pleasure seeking, energetic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">subtle, a world too of dire economic struggle; there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">allusions he did not understand, incidents that conveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange suggestions of altered moral ideals, flashes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dubious enlightment. The blue canvas that bulked so</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely in his first impression of the city ways appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and again as the costume of the common people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had no doubt the story was contemporary, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense realism was undeniable. And the end had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tragedy that oppressed him. He sat staring at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started and rubbed his eyes. He had been so ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed in the latter-day substitute for a novel, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">awoke to the little green and white room with more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a touch of the surprise of his first awakening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood up, and abruptly he was back in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderland. The clearness of the kinetoscope drama</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, and the struggle in the vast place of streets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ambiguous Council, the swift phases of his waking</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, came back. These people had spoken of the Council</seg><seg type="columnLine">with suggestions of a vague universality of power. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had spoken of the Sleeper; it had not really struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him vividly at the time that he was the Sleeper. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to recall precisely what they had said. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked into the bedroom and peered up through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quick intervals of the revolving fan. As the fan</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept round, a dim turmoil like the noise of machinery</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in rhythmic eddies. All else was silence. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the perpetual day still irradiated his apartments, he per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived the little intermittent strip of sky was now deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue--black almost, with a dust of little stars. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He resumed his examination of the rooms. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find no way of opening the padded door, no bell nor other</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of calling for attendance. His feeling of wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in abeyance; but he was curious, anxious for infor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation. He wanted to know exactly how he stood to</seg><seg type="columnLine">these new things. He tried to compose himself to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">until someone came to him. Presently he became rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less and eager for information, for distraction, for fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE went back to the apparatus in the other room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had soon puzzled out the method of replacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinders by others. As he did so, it came into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind that it must be these little appliances had fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the language so that it was still clear and understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able after two hundred years. The haphazard cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders he substituted displayed a musical fantasia. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first it was beautiful and then it was sensuous. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently recognized what appeared to him to be an</seg><seg type="columnLine">altered version of the story of Tannhauser. The music</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unfamiliar. But the rendering was realistic, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with a contemporary unfamiliarity. Tannhauser did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not go to a Venusberg, but to a Pleasure City. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a Pleasure City? A dream, surely, the fancy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fantastic, voluptuous writer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He became interested, curious. The story developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a flavor of strangely twisted sentimentality. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly he 'lid not like it. He liked it less as it proceeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had a revulsion of feeling. These were no pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, no idealisations, but photographed realities. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted no more of the twenty-second century Venus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berg. He forgot the part played by the model in nine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teenth century art, and gave way to an archaic indig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation. He rose, angry and half ashamed at himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for witnessing this thing even in solitude. He pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward the apparatus, and with some violence sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a means of stopping its action. Something snapped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A violet spark stung and convulsed his arm and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was still. When he attempted next day to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place these Tannhauser cylinders by another pair, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the apparatus broken. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He struck out a path oblique to the room and paced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to and fro, struggling with intolerable vast impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions. The things he had derived from the cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the things he had seen, conflicted, confused him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed to him the most amazing thing of all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his thirty years of life he had never tried to shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">a picture of these coming times. "We were making</seg><seg type="columnLine">the future," he said, "and hardly any of us troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think what future we were making. And here it is!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What have they got to, what has been done? How</seg><seg type="columnLine">do I come into the midst of it all?" The vastness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">street and house he was prepared for, the multitudes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. But conflicts in the city ways! And the sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tematized sensuality of a class of rich men!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought of Bellamy, the hero of whose Socialistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Utopia had so oddly anticipated this actual experience.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But here was no Utopia, no Socialistic state. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already seen enough to realize that the ancient antithesis</seg><seg type="columnLine">of luxury, waste and sensuality on the one hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">abject poverty on the other, still prevailed. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough of the essential factors of life to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that correlation. And not only were the buildings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city gigantic and the crowds in the street gigantic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the voices he had heard in the ways, the uneasiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Howard, the very atmosphere spoke of gigantic dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">content. What country was he in? Still England it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, and yet strangely "un-English." His mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at the rest of the world, and saw only an enig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matical veil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He prowled about his apartment, examining every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing as a caged animal might do. He felt very tired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that feverish exhaustion that does not admit of rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He listened for long spaces under the ventilator to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch some distant echo of the tumults he felt must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeding in the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to talk to himself. "Two hundred and three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years!" he said to himself over and over again, laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stupidly. "Then I am two hundred and thirty-three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years old! The oldest inhabitant. Surely they haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">reversed the tendency of our time and gone back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rule of the oldest. My claims are indisputable. Mumble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mumble. I remember the Bulgarian atrocities as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was yesterday. 'Tis a great age! Ha ha!" He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised at first to hear himself laughing, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed again deliberately and louder. Then he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was behaving foolishly. "Steady," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Steady I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His pacing became more regular. "This new world,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "I don't understand it. Why? . . . But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is all why!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose they can fly and do all sorts of things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let me try and remember just how it began."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was surprised at first to find how vague the mem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ories of his first thirty years had become. He remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered fragments, for the most part trivial moments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">things of no great importance that he had observed. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">boyhood seemed the most accessible at first; he recalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">school books and certain lessons in mensuration. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he revived the more salient features of his life, memories</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wife long since dead, her magic influence now</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone beyond corruption, of his rivals and friends and</seg><seg type="columnLine">betrayers, of the swift decision of this issue and that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then of his last years of misery, of fluctuating re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solves, and at last of his strenuous studies. In a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he perceived he had it all again; dim perhaps, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal long laid aside, but in no way defective or injured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of re-polishing. And the hue of it was a deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening misery. Was it worth re-polishing? By a miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been lifted out of a life that had become in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tolerable. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reverted^ to his present condition. He wrestled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the facts in vain. It became an inextricable tangle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the sky through the ventilator pink with dawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An old persuasion came out of the dark recesses of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory. "I must sleep," he said. It appeared as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">delightful relief from this mental distress and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the growing pain and heaviness of his limbs. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the strange little bed, lay down and was presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was destined to become very familiar indeed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">these apartments before he left them, for he remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">imprisoned for three days. During that time no one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except Howard, entered his prison. The marvel of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate mingled with and in some way minimized the mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vel of his survival. He had awakened to mankind it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed only to be snatched away into this unaccount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able solitude. Howard came regularly with subtly sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining and nutritive fluids, and light and pleasant foods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite strange to Graham. He always closed the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully a3 he entered. On matters of detail he was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasingly obliging, but the bearing of Graham on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great issues that were evidently being contested so</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely beyond the sound-proof walls that enclosed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would not elucidate. He evaded, as politely as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, every question on the position of affairs in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND in those three days Graham's incessant thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">went far and wide. All that he had seen, all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">elaborate contrivance to prevent him seeing, worked to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether in his mind. Almost every possible interpre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation of his position he debated--even as it chanced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right interpretation. Things that presently hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to him, came to him at last credible, by virtue of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this seclusion. When at length the moment of his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lease arrived, it found him prepared. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Howard's bearing went far to deepen Graham's im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of his own strange importance; the door be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween its opening and closing seemed to admit with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a breath of momentous happening. His inquiries</seg><seg type="columnLine">became more definite and searching. Howard retreated</seg><seg type="columnLine">through protests and difficulties. The awakening was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unforeseen, he repeated; it happened to have fallen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the trend of a social convulsion. "To explain it</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must tell you the history of a gross and a half of years,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">protested Howard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The thing is this," said Graham. "You are afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of something I shall do. In some way I am arbitrator--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might be arbitrator."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not that. But you have--I may tell you this</seg><seg type="columnLine">much--the automatic increase of your property puts</seg><seg type="columnLine">great possibilities of interference in your hands. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in certain other ways you have influence, with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteenth century notions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nineteenth century," corrected Graham.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With your old world notions, anyhow, ignorant as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are of every feature of our State."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Am I a fool?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Certaii.ly not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do I seem to be the sort of man who would act</seg><seg type="columnLine">rashly?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were never expected to act at all. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted on your awakening. No one dreamt you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever awake. The Council had surrounded you with</seg><seg type="columnLine">antiseptic conditions. As a matter of fact, we thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you were dead--a mere arrest of decay. And--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is too complex. We dare not suddenly--while you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are still half awake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't do," said Graham. "Suppose it is as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say--why am I not being crammed night and day with</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts and warnings and all the wisdom of the time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit me for my responsibilities? Am I any wiser now</seg><seg type="columnLine">than two days ago, if it is two days, when I awoke?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howard pulled his lip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am beginning to feel--every hour I feel more</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly--a sense of complex concealment of which you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the salient point. Is this Council, or committee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or whatever they are, cooking the accounts of my estate?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is that it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That note of suspicion--" said Howard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ugh 1" said Graham. "Now, mark my words, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be ill for those who have put me here. It will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill. I am alive. Make no doubt of it, I am alive. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">day my pulse is stronger and my mind clearer and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorous. No more quiescence. I am a man come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to life. And I want to live--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Live!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Howard's face lit with an idea. He came towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham and spoke in an easy confidential tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Council secludes you here for your good. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are restless. Naturally--an energetic man! You find</seg><seg type="columnLine">it dull here. But we are anxious that everything you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may desire--every desire--every sort of desire . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">There may be something. Is there any sort of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused meaningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Graham thoughtfully. "There is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! Now! We have treated you neglectfully."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The crowds in yonder streets of yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," said Howard, "I am afraid--. But--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham began pacing the room. Howard stood near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door watching him. The implication of Howard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion was only half evident to Graham. Company?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suppose he were to accept the proposal, demand some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of company? Would there be any possibilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gathering from the conversation of this additional</seg><seg type="columnLine">person some vague inkling of the struggle that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken out so vividly at his waking moment? He medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated again, and the suggestion took color. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Howard abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean by company?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Howard raised his eyes and shrugged his shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Human beings," he said, with a curious smile on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our social ideas," he said, "have a certain increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberality, perhaps, in comparison with your times. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man wishes to relieve such a tedium as this--by</seg><seg type="columnLine">feminine society, for instance. We think it no scandal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have cleared our minds of formulfe. There is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our city a class, a necessary class, no longer despised--</seg><seg type="columnLine">discreet--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham stopped dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would pass the time," said Howard. "It is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I should perhaps have thought of before, but, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of fact, so much is happening--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He indicated the exterior world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham hesitated. For a moment the figure of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible woman that his imagination suddenly created</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dominated his mind with an intense attraction. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he flashed into anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" he shouted.-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began striding rapidly up and down the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Everything you say, everything you do, convinces me</seg><seg type="columnLine">--of some great issue in which I am concerned. I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not want to pass the time, as you call it. Yes, I know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Desire and indulgence are life in a sense--and Death!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Extinction! In my life before I slept I had worked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that pitiful question. I will not begin again. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a city, a multitude--. And meanwhile I am here</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a rabbit in a bag."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His rage surged high. He choked for a moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to wave his clenched fists. He gave way to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger fit, he swore archaic curses. His gestures had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quality of physical threats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not know who your party may be. I am in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark, and you keep me in the dark. But I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, that I am secluded here for no good purpose. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">no good purpose. I warn you, I warn you of the conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quences. Once I come at my power--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He realized that to threaten thus might be a danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself. He stopped. Howard stood regarding him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a curious expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I take it this is a message to the Council," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham had a momentary impulse to leap upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, fell or stun him. It must have shown upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face; at any rate Howard's movement was quick. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second the noiseless door had closed again, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man from the nineteenth century was alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he stood rigid, with clenched hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">half raised. Then he flung them down. "What a fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been!" he said, and gave way to his anger again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamping about the room and shouting curses. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a long time he kept himself in a sort of frenzy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging at his position, at his own folly, at the knaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had imprisoned him. He did this because he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not want to look calmly at his position. He clung to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his anger--because he was afraid of Fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he found himself reasoning with himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This imprisonment was unaccountable, but no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the legal forms--new legal forms--of the time permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It must, of course, be legal. These people were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years further on in the march of civilization</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the Victorian generation. It was not likely they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be less--humane. Yet they had cleared their</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds of formulas! Was humanity a formula as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as chastity?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His imagination set to work to suggest things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be done to him. The attempts of his reason to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispose of these suggestions, though for the most part</seg><seg type="columnLine">logically valid, were quite unavailing. "Why should</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything be done to me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If the worst comes to the worst," he found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying at last, "I can give up what they want. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what do they want? And why don't they ask me for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it instead of cooping me up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned to his former preoccupation with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council's possible intentions. He began to reconsider</seg><seg type="columnLine">the details of Howard's behavior, sinister glances, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">explicable hesitations. Then, for a time, his mind circled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the idea of escaping from these rooms; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">whither could he escape into this vast, crowded world?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would be worse off than a Saxon yeoman suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped into nineteenth century London. And besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how could anyone escape from these rooms?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can it benefit anyone if harm should happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought of the tumult, the great social trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which he was so unaccountably the axis. A text,</seg><seg type="columnLine">irrelevant enough and yet curiously insistent, came float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up out of the darkness of his memory. This also</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Council had said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is expedient for us that one man should die for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Roof Spaces</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS the fans in the circular aperture of the inner room</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotated and permitted glimpses of the night, dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds drifted in thereby. And Graham, stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing underneath, wrestling darkly with the unknown pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers that imprisoned him, and which he had now delib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erately challenged, was startled by the sound of a voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He peered up and saw in the intervals of the rota-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, dark and dim, the face and shoulders of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding him. Then a dark hand was extended, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift van struck it, swung round and beat on with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little brownish patch on the edge of its thin blade, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">something began to fall therefrom upon the floor, drip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping silently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham looked down, and there were spots of blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his feet. He looked up again in a strange excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. The figure had gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He remained motionless--his every sense intent upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flickering patch of darkness, for outside it was high</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. He became aware of some faint, remote, dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">specks floating lightly through the outer air. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down towards him, fitfully, eddyingly, and passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside out of the uprush from the fan. A gleam of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickered, the specks flashed white, and then the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">came again. Warmed and lit as he was, he perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was snowing within a few feet of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham walked across the room and came back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ventilator again. He saw the head of a man pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">near. There was a sound of whispering. Then a smart</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow on some metallic substance, effort, voices, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vans stopped. A gust of snowflakes whirled into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and vanished before they touched the floor. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be afraid," said a voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham stood under the van. "Who are you?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment there was nothing but a swaying of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fan, and then the head of a man was thrust cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously into the opening. His face appeared nearly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verted to Graham; his dark hair was wet with dissolving</seg><seg type="columnLine">flakes of snow upon it. His arm went up into the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness holding something unseen. He had a youthful face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bright eyes, and the veins of his forehead were</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen. He seemed to be exerting himself to main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain his position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For several seconds neither he nor Graham spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You were the Sleeper?" said the stranger at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," said Graham. "What do you want with me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I come from Ostrog, Sire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ostrog?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man in the ventilator twisted his head round</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that his profile was towards Graham. He appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be listening. Suddenly there was a hasty exclama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and the intruder sprang back just in time to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sweep of the released fan. And when Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered up there was nothing visible but the slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was perhaps a quarter of an hour before anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to the ventilator. But at last came the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic interference again; the fans stopped and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face reappeared. Graham had remained all this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same place, alert and tremulously excited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you? What do you want?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We want to speak to you, Sire," said the intruder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We want--I can't hold the thing. We have been try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to find a way to you--these three days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it rescue?" whispered Graham. "Escape?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Sire. If you will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are my party--the party of the Sleeper?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Sire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What am I to do?" said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a struggle. The stranger's arm appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his hand was bleeding. His knees came into view</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the edge of the funnel. "Stand away from me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'said, and he dropped rather heavily on his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one shoulder at Graham's feet. The released venti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lator whirled noisily. The stranger rolled over, sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">up nimbly and stood panting, hand to a bruised shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with his bright eyes on Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are indeed the Sleeper," he said. "I saw you</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep. When it was the law that anyone might see</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am the man who was in the trance," said Graham.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They have imprisoned me here. I have been here since</seg><seg type="columnLine">I awoke--at least three days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The intruder seemed about to speak, heard some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, glanced swiftly at the door, and suddenly left</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham and ran towards it, shouting quick incoherent</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. A bright wedge of steel flashed in his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he began tap, tap, a quick succession of blows upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hinges. "Mind!" cried a voice. "Oh!" The voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham glanced up, saw the soles of two feet, ducked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was struck on the shoulder by one of them, and a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight bore him to the earth. He fell on his knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forward, and the weight went over his head. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knelt up and saw a second man from above seated be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did not see you, Sire," panted the man. He rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and assisted Graham to arise. "Are you hurt, Sire?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">panted. A succession of heavy blows on the ventilator</seg><seg type="columnLine">began, something fell close to Graham's face, and' a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivering edge of white metal danced, fell over, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay flat upon the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is this?" cried Graham, confused and look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the ventilator. "Who are you? What are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to do? Remember, I understand nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand back," said the stranger, and drew him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the ventilator as another fragment of metal fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We want you to come, Sire," panted the newcomer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Graham glancing at his face again, saw a new cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">had changed from white to red on his forehead, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of little trickles of blood started therefrom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your people call for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come where? My people?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the hall about the markets. Your life is in dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger here. We have spies. We learned but just in time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Council has decided--this very day--either to drug</seg><seg type="columnLine">or kill you. And everything is ready. The people are</seg><seg type="columnLine">drilled, the wind-vane police, the engineers, and half</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way-gearers are with us. We have the halls crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">--shouting. The whole city shouts against the Council.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have arms." He wiped the blood with his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your life here is not worth--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why arms?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"The people have risen to protect you, Sire. What?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned quickly as the man who had first come down</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a hissing with his teeth. Graham saw the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">start back, gesticulate to them to conceal themselves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and move as if to hide behind the opening door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he did so Howard appeared, a little tray in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and his heavy face downcast. He started, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, the door slammed behind him, the tray tilted side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, and the steel wedge struck him behind the ear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went down like a felled tree, and lay as he fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">athwart the floor of the outer room. The man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck him bent hastily, studied his face for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose, and returned to his work at the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your poison!" said a voice in Graham's ear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN abruptly they were in darkness. The innum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erable cornice lights had been extinguished. Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham saw the aperture of the ventilator with ghostly snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling above it and dark figures moving hastily. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">knelt on the van. Some dim thing--a ladder--was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered through the opening, and a hand appeared hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a fitful yellow light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had a moment of hesitation. But the manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these men, their swift alacrity, their words, marched</seg><seg type="columnLine">so completely with his own fears of the Council, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his idea and hope of a rescue, that it lasted not a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And his people awaited him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not understand," he said, "I trust. Tell me what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man with the cut brow gripped Graham's arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Clamber up the ladder," he whispered. "Quick. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have heard--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham felt for the ladder with extended hands, put</seg><seg type="columnLine">his foot on the lower rung, and, turning his head, saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the shoulder of the nearest man, in the yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicker of the light, the first-comer astride over Howard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still working at the door. Graham turned to the lad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der again, and was thrust by his conductor and helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up by those above, and then he was standing on some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing hard and cold and slippery outside the ventilating</seg><seg type="columnLine">funnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shivered. He was aware of a great difference in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temperature. Half a dozen men stood about him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and light flakes of snow touched hands and face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">melted. For a moment it was dark, then for a flash a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly violet white, and then everything was dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.	__</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw he had come out upon the roof of the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">city structure which had replaced the miscellaneous</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses, streets and open spaces of Victorian London.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The place upon which he stood was level, with huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">serpentine cables lying athwart it in every direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The circular wheels of a number of windmills loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">indistinct and gigantic through the darkness and snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall, and roared with a varying loudness as the fitful</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind rose and fell. Some way off an intermittent white</seg><seg type="columnLine">light smote up from below, touched the snow eddies with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a transient glitter, and made an evanescent spectre in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night; and here and there, low down, some vaguely</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlined wind-driven mechanism flickered with livid</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this he appreciated in a fragmentary manner as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rescuers stood about him. Someone threw a thick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft cloak of fur-like texture about him, and fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">it by buckled straps at waist and shoulders. Things</seg><seg type="columnLine">were said briefly, decisively. Someone thrust him for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before his mind was yet clear a dark shape gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm. "This way," said this shape, urging him</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, and pointed Graham across the flat roof in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of a dim semicircular haze of light. Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hindi" said a voice, as Graham stumbled against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cable. "Between them and not across them," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. And, "We must hurry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are the people?" said Graham. "The people</seg><seg type="columnLine">you said awaited me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger did not answer. He left Graham's arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the path grew narrower, and led the way with rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">strides. Graham followed blindly. In a minute he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself running. "Are the others coming?" he panted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but received no reply. His companion glanced back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran on. They came to a sort of pathway of open</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal-work, transverse to the direction they had come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they turned aside to follow this. Graham looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, but the snowstorm had hidden the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on I" said his guide. Running now, they drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">near a little windmill spinning high in the air. "Stoop,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">said Graham's guide, and they avoided an endless band</seg><seg type="columnLine">running roaring up to the shaft of the vane. "This way!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were ankle deep in a gutter full of drifted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thawing snow, between two low walls of metal that pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently rose waist high. "I will go first," said the guide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham drew his cloak about him and followed. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly came a narrow abyss across which the gutter</seg><seg type="columnLine">leapt to the snowy darkness of the further side. Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">peeped over the side once and the gulf was black. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment he regretted his flight. He dared not look</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and his brain spun as he waded through the half</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then out of the gutter they clambered and hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a wide, flat space damp with thawing snow, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for half its extent dimly translucent to lights that went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to and fro underneath. He hesitated at this unstable</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking substance, but his guide ran on unheeding, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so they came to and clambered up slippery steps to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rim of a great dome of glass. Round this they went.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Far below a number of people seemed to be dancing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">music filtered through the dome. . . . Graham fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cied he heard a shouting through the snowstorm, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his guide hurried him on with a new spurt of haste.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They clambered panting to a space of huge windmills,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one so vast that only the lower edge of its vans came</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing into sight and rushed up again and was lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the night and the snow. They hurried for a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the colossal metallic tracery of its supports, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came at last above a place of moving platforms like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place into which Graham had looked from the bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cony. They crawled across the sloping transparency that</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered this street of platforms, crawling on hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees because of the slipperiness of the snowfall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the most part the glass was bedewed, and Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham saw only hazy suggestions of the forms below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but near the pitch of the transparent roof the glass was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, and he found himself looking sheerly down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all. For awhile, in spite of the urgency of his guide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave way to vertigo and lay spread-eagled on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass, sick and paralyzed. Far below, mere stirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">specks and dots, went the people of the unsleeping city</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their perpetual daylight, and the moving platforms</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran on their incessant journey. Messengers and men</seg><seg type="columnLine">on unknown businesses shot along the drooping cables</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the frail bridges were crowded with men. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like peering into a gigantic glass hive, and it lay verti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally below him with only a tough glass of unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickness to save him from a fall. The street showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm and lit, and Graham was wet now to the skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">with thawing snow, and his feet were numbed with cold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a space he could not move. "Come on I" cried his</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide, with terror in his voice. "Come on!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham reached the pitch of the roof by an effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over the ridge, following his guide's example, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned about and slid backward down the opposite slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">very swiftly, amid a little avalanche of snow. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was sliding he thought of what would happen if some</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken gap should come in his way. At the edge he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled to his feet ankle deep in slush, thanking heaven</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an opaque footing again. His guide was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambering up a metal screen to a level expanse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the spare snowflakes above this loomed an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other line of vast windmills, and then suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amorphous tumult of the rotating wheels was pierced</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a deafening sound. It was a mechanical shrilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of extraordinary intensity that seemed to come simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously from every point of the compass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have missed us already!" cried Graham's guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an accent of terror, and suddenly, with a blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash, the night became day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the driving snow, from the summits of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-wheels, appeared vast masts carrying globes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">livid light. They receded in illimitable vistas in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. As far as his eye could penetrate the snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall they glared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get on this," cried Graham's conductor, and thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">him forward to a long grating of snowless metal that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran like a band between two slightly sloping expanses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of snow. It felt warm to Graham's benumbed feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint eddy of steam rose from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come 011!" shouted his guide ten yards off, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without waiting, ran swiftly through the incandescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare towards the iron supports of the next range of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-wheels. Graham, recovering from his astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, followed as fast, convinced of his imminent cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a score of seconds they were within a tracery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare and black shadows shot with moving bars beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monstrous wheels. Graham's conductor ran on for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time, and suddenly darted sideways and vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a black shadow in the corner of the foot of a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">support. In another moment Graham was beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They cowered panting and stared out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE scene upon which Graham looked was very wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strange. The snow had now almost ceased;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">only a belated flake passed now and again across the pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. But the broad stretch of level before them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ghastly white, broken only by gigantic masses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving shapes and lengthy strips of impenetrable dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, vast ungainly Titans of shadow. All about them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge metallic structures, iron girders, inhumanly vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it seemed to him, interlaced, and the edges of wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels, scarcely moving in the lull, passed in great shin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing curves steeper and steeper up into a luminous haze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wherever the snow-spangled light struck down, beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">and girders, and incessant bands running with a halting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indomitable resolution, passed upward and downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the black. And with all that mighty activity, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an omnipresent sense of motive and design, this snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad desolation of mechanism seemed void of all human</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence save themselves, seemed as trackless and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted and unfrequented by men as some inaccessible</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alpine snowfield. s!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They will b£."cnasing us," cried the leader. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">are scarcely^.lKiifway there yet.

For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second they were clear, then hazy through a thick whirl</seg><seg type="columnLine">of snow, then small and distant, and in a minute they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now!" cried his companion. "Come!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pulled Graham's sleeve, and incontinently the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">were running headlong down the arcade of ironwork be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the wind-wheels. Graham, running blindly, col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lided with his leader, who had turned back on him sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly. He found himself within a dozen yards of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black chasm. It extended as far as he could see right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left. It seemed to cut off their progress in either</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do as I do," whispered his guide. He lay down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled to the edge, thrust his head over and twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">until one leg hung. He seemed to feel for something</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his foot, found it, and went sliding over the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the gulf. His head reappeared. "It is a ledge,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he whispered. "In the dark all the way along. Do as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham hesitated, went down upon all fours, crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the edge, and peered into a velvety blackness. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickly moment he had courage neither to go on nor re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat, then he sat and hung his leg down, felt his guide's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands pulling at him, had a horrible sensation of sliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the edge into the unfathomable, splashed, and felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in a slushy gutter, impenetrably dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This way," whispered the voice, and he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling along the gutter through the trickling thaw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing himself against the wall. They continued along</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for some minutes. He seemed to pass through a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred stages of misery, to pass minute after minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a hundred degrees of cold, damp, and exhaus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. In a little while he ceased to feel his hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gutter sloped downwards. He observed that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now many feet below the edge of the buildings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rows of spectral white shapes like the ghosts of blind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn windows rose above them. They came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of a cable fastened above one of these white win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows, dimly visible and dropping into impenetrable</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows. Suddenly his hand came against his guide's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Still!" whispered the latter very softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked up with a start and saw the huge wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flying machine gliding slowly and noiselessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead athwart the broad band of snow-flecked grey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue sky. In a moment it was hidden again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep still; they were just turning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For awhile both were motionless, then Graham's com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion stood up, and reaching towards the fastenings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cable fumbled with some indistinct tackle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is that?" asked Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only answer was a faint cry. The man crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless. Graham peered and saw his face dimly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was staring down the long ribbon of sky, and Graham,</seg><seg type="columnLine">following his eyes, saw the flying machine small and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint and remote. Then he saw that the wings spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">on either side, that it headed towards them, that every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moment it grew larger. It was following the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chasm towards them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's movements became convulsive. He thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">two cross bars into Graham's hand. Graham could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see them, he ascertained their form by feeling. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were slung by thin cords to the cable. On the cord</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hand grips of some soft elastic substance. "Put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross between your legs," whispered the guide hyster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ically, "and grip the holdfasts. Grip tightly, grip!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham did as he was told.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jump," said the voice. "In heaven's name, jump!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">For one momentous second Graham could not speak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was glad afterwards that darkness hid his face. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">said nothing. He began to tremble violently. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideways at the swift shadow that swallowed up the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it rushed upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jump! Jump--in God's name! Or they will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">us," cried Graham's guide, and in the violence of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion thrust him forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham tottered convulsively, gave a sobbing cry, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry in spite of himself, and then, as the flying machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept over them, fell forward into the pit of that dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, seated on the cross wood and holding the ropes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the clutch of death. Something cracked, something</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapped smartly against a wall. He heard the pulley of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cradle hum on its rope. He heard the aeronauts</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout. He felt a pair of knees digging into his back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">... He was sweeping headlong through the air, fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the air. All his strength was in his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would have screamed but he had no breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shot into a blinding light that made him grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tighter. He recognized the great passage with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">running ways, the hanging lights and interlacing gir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders. They rushed upward and by him. He had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentary impression of a great circular aperture</seg><seg type="columnLine">yawning to swallow him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was in the dark again, falling, falling, gripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">with aching hands, and behold! a clap of sound, a burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light, and he was in a brightly lit hall with a roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude of people beneath his feet. The people! His</seg><seg type="columnLine">people! A proscenium, a stage rushed up towards him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his cable swept down to a circular aperture to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right of this. He felt he was travelling slower, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly very much slower. He distinguished shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of "Saved! The Master. He is safe!" The stage rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up towards him with rapidly diminishing swiftness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then--.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard the man clinging behind him shout as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly terrified, and this shout was echoed by a shout</seg><seg type="columnLine">from below. He felt that he was no longer gliding along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cable but falling with it. There was a tumult of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yells, screams and cries. He felt something soft against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his extended hand, and the impact of a broken fall quiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering through his arm. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wanted to be still and the people were lifting him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He believed afterwards he was carried to the platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">and given some drink, but he was never sure. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not notice what became of his guide. When his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear again he was on his feet; eager hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">assisting him to stand. He was in a big alcove, occupy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the position that in his previous experience had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted to the lower boxes. If this was indeed a theatre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A mighty tumult was in his ears, a thunderous roar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shouting of a countless multitude. "It is the Sleeper!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Sleeper is with us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Sleeper is with us! The Master--the Owner!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Master is with us. He is safe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham had a surging vision of a great hall crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with people. He saw no individuals, he was conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a froth of pink faces, of waving arms and garments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt the occult influence of a vast crowd pouring over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, buoying him up. There were balconies, galleries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">great archways giving remoter perspectives, and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where people, a vast arena of people, densely packed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cheering. Across the nearer space lay the collapsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable like a huge snake. It had been cut by the men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying machine at its upper end, and had crumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the hall. Men seemed to be hauling this out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the way. But the whole effect was vague, the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings throbbed and leapt with the roar of the voices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood unsteadily and looked at those about him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Someone supported him by one arm. "Let me go into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little room," he said, weeping; "a little room," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could say no more. A man in black stepped forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his disengaged arm. He was aware of officious men</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening a door before him. Someone guided him to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat. He staggered. He sat down heavily and covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face with his hands; he was trembling violently, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous control was at an end. He was relieved of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloak, he could not remember how; his purple hose he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw were black with wet. People were running about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, things were happening, but for some time he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">no heed to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had escaped. A myriad of cries told him that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was safe. These were the people who were on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. For a space he sobbed for breath, and then he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">still with his face covered. The air was full of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting of innumerable men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg><seg type="columnLine">The People March</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE became aware of someone urging a glass of clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluid upon his attention, looked up and discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was a dark young man in a yellow garment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took the dose forthwith, and in a moment he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing. A tall man in a black robe stood by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, and pointed to the half open door into the hall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This man was shouting close to his ear and yet what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">said was indistinct because of the tremendous uproar</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the great theatre. Behind the man was a girl in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">silvery grey robe, whom Graham, even in this confusion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived to be beautiful. Her dark eyes, full of wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">end curiosity were fixed on him, her lips trembled apart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A partially opened door gave a glimpse of the crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall, and admitted a vast uneven tumult, a hammering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clapping and shouting that died away and began again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rose to a thunderous pitch, and so continued inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittently all the time that Graham remained in the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. He watched the lips of the man in black and gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered that he was making some clumsy explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared stupidly for some moments at these things</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then stood up abruptly; he grasped the arm of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting person.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me!" he cried. "Who am I? Who am I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The others came nearer to hear his words. "Who am</seg><seg type="columnLine">I?" His eyes searched their faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have told him nothing!" cried the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me, tell me!" cried Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are the Master of the Earth.

He resisted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuasion. He pretended not to understand, not to hear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lifted his voice again. "I have been awake three days</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a prisoner three days. I judge there is some struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">between a number of people in this city--it is London?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," said the younger man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And those who meet in the great hall with the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlas?

"The world is on your shoulders. They rule it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your name."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sounds from the hall had died into a silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">threaded by one monotonous voice. Now suddenly, tramp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling on these last words, came a deafening tumult, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring and thundering, cheer crowded on cheer, voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse and shrill, beating, overlapping, and while it lasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people in the little room could not hear each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham stood, his intelligence clinging helplessly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing he had just heard. "The Council," he repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankly, and then snatched at a name that had struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "But who is Ostrog?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is the organizer--the orgarizer of the revolt.

Why is he not here?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He--has deputed us. I am his brother--his half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother, Lincoln.

Master?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The younger man suddenly became audible in a pause</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the outer thunder, indignant and vociferous, a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrating voice under his red aquiline nose and bushy</seg><seg type="columnLine">moustache. "No one expected you to wake. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected you to wake. They were cunning. Damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">tyrants! But they were taken by surprise.

Of all his fluctuating impressions the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominant ones presented an antagonism; on the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand was the White Council, powerful, disciplined, few,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Council from which he had just escaped; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other, monstrous crowds, packed masses of indis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguishable people clamoring his name, hailing him</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master. The other side had imprisoned him, debated his</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. These shouting thousands beyond the little door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way had rescued him. But why these things should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he could not understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened, Lincoln's voice was swept away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned, and a rush of people followed on the heels of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tumult. These intruders came towards him and Lin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coln gesticulating. The voices without explained their</seg><seg type="columnLine">soundless lips. "Show us the Sleeper, show us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleeper!" was the burden of the ..uproar. Men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bawling for "Order! Silence!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham glanced towards the open doorway, and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tall, oblong picture of the hall beyond, a waving, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessant confusion of crowded, shouting faces, men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women together, waving pale blue garments, extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Many were standing, one man in rags of dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown, a gaunt figure, stood on the seat and waved a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black cloth. He met the wonder and expectation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's eyes. What did these people expect from him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was dimly aware that the tumult outside had changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">its character, was in some way beating, marching. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">own mind, too, changed. For a space he did not recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nize the influence that was transforming him. But a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment that was near to panic passed. He tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make audible inquiries of what was required of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lincoln was shouting in his ear, but Graham was</seg><seg type="columnLine">deafened to that. All the others save the woman ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticulated towards the hall. He perceived what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to the uproar. The whole mass of people was</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanting together. It was not simply a song, the voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gathered together and upborne by a torrent of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strumental music, music like the music of an organ, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woven texture of sounds, full of trumpets, full of flaunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing banners, full of the march and pageantry of opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">war. And the feet of the people were beating time--</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp, tramp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was urged towards the door. He obeyed mechanic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally. The strength of that chant took hold of him, stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, emboldened him. The hall opened to him, a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">welter of fluttering color swaying to the music.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Wave your arm to them," said Lincoln. "Wave your</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm to them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This," said a voice on the other side, "he must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">this." Arms were about his neck detaining him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway, and a black subtly-folding mantle hung from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders. He threw his arm free of this and fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed Lincoln. He perceived the girl in grey close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, her face lit, her gesture onward. For the instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">she became to him, flushed and eager as she was, an em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodiment of the song. He emerged in the alcove again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Incontinently the mounting waves of the song broke upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his appearing, and flashed up into a foam of shouting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guided by Lincoln's hand he marched obliquely across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">centre of the stage facing the people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE hall was a vast and intricate space--galleries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">balconies, broad spaces of amphitheatral steps, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">great archways. Far away, high up, seemed the mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a huge passage full of struggling humanity. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole multitude was swaying in congested masses. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual figures sprang out of the tumult, impressed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily, and lost definition again. Close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform swayed a beautiful fair woman, carried by</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men, her hair across her face and brandishing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">green staff. Next this group an old careworn man in blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas maintained his place in the crush with difficulty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and behind shouted a hairless face, a great cavity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">toothless mouth. A voice called that enigmatical word</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ostrog." All his impressions were vague save the mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive emotion of that trampling song. The multitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">were beating time with their feet--marking time, tramp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp, tramp, tramp. The green weapons waved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed and slanted. Then he saw those nearest to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a level space before the stage were marching in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him, passing towards a great archway, shouting "To</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Council!" Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. He raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm, and the roaring was redoubled. He remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had to shout "March!" His mouth shaped inaudible</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroic words. He waved his arm again and pointed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the archway, shouting "Onward!" They were no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">marking time, they were marching; tramp, tramp, tramp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp. In that host were bearded men, old men, youths,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluttering robed bare-armed women, girls. Men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women of the new age I Rich robes, grey rags fluttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">together in the whirl of their movement amidst the domi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant blue. A monstrous black banner jerked its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right. He perceived a blue-clad negro, a shrivelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman in yellow, then a group of tall fair-haired, white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced, blue-clad men pushed theatrically past him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted two Chinamen. A tall, sallow, dark-haired, shining-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed youth, white clad from top to toe, clambered up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the platform shouting loyally, and sprang down</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and receded, looking backward. Heads, shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands clutching weapons, all were swinging with those</seg><seg type="columnLine">marching cadences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Faces came out of the confusion to him as he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, eyes met his and passed and vanished. Men ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticulated to him, shouted inaudible personal things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most of the faces were flushed, but many were ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">white. And disease was there, and many a hand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved to him was gaunt and lean. Men and women of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new age! Strange and incredible meeting! As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad stream passed before him to the right, tributary</seg><seg type="columnLine">gangways from the remote uplands of the hall thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward in an incessant replacement of people; tramp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp, tramp, tramp. The unison of the song was en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riched and complicated by the massive echoes of arches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and passages. Men and women mingled in the ranks;</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. The whole world seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">marching. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp; his brain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramping. The garments waved onward, the faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured by more abundantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp; at Lincoln's pressure he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned towards the archway, walking unconsciously in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rhythm, scarcely noticing his movement for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">melody and stir of it. The multitude, the gesture and</seg><seg type="columnLine">song, all moved in that direction, the flow of people smote</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward until the upturned faces ware below the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his feet. He was aware of a path before him, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a suite about him, of guards and dignitaries, and Lincoln</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his right hand. Attendants intervened, and ever and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again blotted out the sight of the multitude to the left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before him went the backs of the guards in black--</seg><seg type="columnLine">three and three and three. He was marched along a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little railed way, and crossed above the archway, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the torrent dipping to flow beneath, and shouting up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He did not know whither he went; he did not want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know. He glanced back across a flaming spaciousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hall. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Battle of the Darkness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE was no longer in the hall. He was marching</seg><seg type="columnLine">along a gallery overhanging one of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets of the moving platforms that traversed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. Before him and behind him tramped his guards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whole concave of the moving ways below was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">congested mass of people marching, tramping to the left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting, waving hands and arms, pouring along a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">vista, shouting as they came into view, shouting as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, shouting as they receded, until the globes of elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric light receding in perspective dropped down it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hid the swarming bare heads. Tramp, tramp, tramp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The song roared up to Graham now, no longer upborne</seg><seg type="columnLine">by music, but coarse and noisy, and the beating of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marching feet, tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp, interwove</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a thunderous irregularity of footsteps from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">undisciplined rabble that poured along the higher ways.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruptly he noted a contrast. The buildings on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite side of the way seemed deserted, the cables</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bridges that laced across the aisle were empty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy. It came into Graham's mind that these also</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have swarmed with people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt a curious emotion--throbbing--very fast! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped again. The guards before him marched on;</seg><seg type="columnLine">those about him stopped as he did. He saw the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their faces. The throbbing had something to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights. He too looked up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first it seemed to him a thing that affected the lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply, an isolated phenomenon, having no bearing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the things below. Each huge globe of blinding white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was as it were clutched, compressed in a systole that</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was followed by a transitory diastole, and again a systole</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a tightening grip, darkness, light, darkness, in rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham became aware that this strange behavior of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights had to do with the people below. The appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of the houses and ways, the appearance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed masses changed, became a confusion of vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights and leaping shadows. He saw a multitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows had sprung into aggressive existence, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing up, broadening, widening, growing with steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftness--to leap suddenly back and return reinforced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The song and the tramping had ceased. The unanimous</seg><seg type="columnLine">march, he discovered, was arrested, there were eddies, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flow sideways, shouts of "The lights!" Voices were</seg><seg type="columnLine">crying together one thing. "The lights!" cried these</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices. "The lights!" He looked down. In this danc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing death of the lights the area of the street had sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly become a monstrous struggle. The huge white</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes became purple-white, purple with a reddish glow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickered, flickered faster and faster, fluttered between</seg><seg type="columnLine">light and extinction, ceased to flicker and became mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">fading specks of glowing red in a vast obscurity. In ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds the extinction was accomplished, and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only this roaring darkness, a black monstrosity that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly swallowed up those glittering myriads of men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt invisible forms about him; his arms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped. Something rapped sharply against his shin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A voice bawled in his ear, "It is all right--all right."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham shook off the paralysis of his first astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. He struck his forehead against Lincoln's and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bawled, "What is this darkness?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Council has cut the currents that light the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We must wait--stop. The people will go on. They will--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">His voice was drowned. Voices were shouting, "Save</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sleeper. Take care of the Sleeper." A guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled against Graham and hurt his hand by an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">advertent blow of his weapon. A wild tumult tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whirled about him, growing, as it seemed, louder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">denser, more furious each moment. Fragments of recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nizable sounds drove towards him, were whirled away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him as his mind reached out to grasp them. Voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be shouting conflicting orders, other voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered. There were suddenly a succession of piercing</seg><seg type="columnLine">screams close beneath them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A voice bawled in his ear, "The red police," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">receded forthwith beyond his questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A crackling sound grew to distinctness, and therewith</seg><seg type="columnLine">a leaping of faint flashes along the edge of the further</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways. By their light Graham saw the heads and bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a number of men, armed with weapons like those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his guards, leap into an instant's dim visibility. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole area began to crackle, to flash with little instant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aneous streaks of light, and abruptly the darkness rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back like a curtain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A glare of light dazzled his eyes, a vast seething ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panse of struggling men confused his mind. A shout,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a burst of cheering, came across the ways. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to see the source of the light. A man hung far over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head from the upper part of a cable, holding by a rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blinding star that had driven the darkness back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wore a red uniform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham's eyes fell to the ways again. A wedge of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little way along the vista caught his eye. He saw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a dense mass of red-clad men jammed on the higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">further way, their backs against the pitiless cliff of build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and surrounded by a dense crowd of antagonists.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were fighting. Weapons flashed and rose and fell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads vanished at the edge of the contest, and other heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced them, the little flashes from the green weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">became little jets of smoky grey while the light lasted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ABRUPTLY the flare was extinguished and the ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">were an inky darkness once more, a tumultuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt something thrusting against him. He was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed along the gallery. Someone was shouting--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be at him. He was too confused to hear. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thrust against the wall, and a number of people</seg><seg type="columnLine">blundered past him. It seemed to him that his guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">were struggling with one another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the cable-hung star-holder appeared again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the whole scene was white and dazzling. The band</seg><seg type="columnLine">of red-coats seemed broader and nearer; its apex was</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-way down the ways towards the central aisle. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising his eyes Graham saw that a number of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had also appeared now in the darkened lower gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leries of the opposite building, and were firing over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads of their fellows below at the boiling confusion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people on the lower ways. The meaning of these things</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawned upon him. The march of the people had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon an ambush at the very outset. Thrown into con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion by the extinction of the lights they were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">being attacked by the red police. Then he became aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was standing alone, that his guards and Lincoln</seg><seg type="columnLine">were along the gallery in the direction along which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come before the darkness fell. He saw they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesticulating to him wildly, running back towards him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A great shouting came from across the ways. Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed as though the whole face of the darkened build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing opposite was lined and speckled with red-clad men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And they were pointing over to him and shouting. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleeper! Save the Sleeper!" shouted a multitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">throats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something struck the wall above his head. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at the impact and saw a star-shaped splash of silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. He saw Lincoln near him. Felt his arm gripped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, pat, pat; he had been missed twice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he did not understand this. The street</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hidden, everything was hidden, as he looked. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">second flare had burned out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lincoln had gripped Graham by the arm, was lugging</seg><seg type="columnLine">him along the gallery. "Before the next light!" he cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His haste was contagious. Graham's instinct of self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preservation overcame the paralysis of his incredulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment. He became for a time the blind creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fear of death. He ran, stumbling because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainty of the darkness, blundered into his guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they turned to run with him. Haste was his one desire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape this perilous gallery upon which he was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed. A third glare came close on its predecessors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With it came a great shouting across the ways, an an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swering tumult from the ways. The red-coats below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw, had now almost gained the central passage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their countless faces turned towards him, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted. The white facade opposite was densely stippled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with red. All these wonderful things concerned him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned upon him as a pivot. These were the guards of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Council attempting to recapture him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lucky it was for him that these shots were the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired in anger for a hundred and fifty years. He heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets whacking over his head, felt a splash of molten</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal sting his ear, and perceived without looking that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole opposite facade, an unmasked ambuscade of</seg><seg type="columnLine">red police, was crowded and bawling and firing at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down went one of his guards before him, and Graham,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to stop, leapt the writhing body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another second he had plunged, unhurt, into a black ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage, and incontinently someone, coming, it may be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a transverse direction, blundered violently into him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He was hurling down a staircase in absolute darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He reeled, and was struck again, and came against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall with his hands. He was crushed by a weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling bodies, whirled round, and thrust to the right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A vast pressure pinned him. He could not breathe, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribs seemed cracking. He felt a momentary relaxation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the whole mass of people moving together, bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">him back towards the great theatre from which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">so recently come. There were moments when his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">79</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">did not touch the ground. Then he was staggering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoving. He heard shouts of "They are coming!" and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">muffled cry close to him. His foot blundered against</seg><seg type="columnLine">something soft, he heard a hoarse scream under foot. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard shouts of "The Sleeper!" but he was too confused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak. He heard the green weapons crackling. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a space he lost his individual will, became an atom in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic, blind, unthinking, mechanical. He thrust and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed back and writhed in the pressure, kicked pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently against a step, and found himself ascending a slope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And abruptly the faces all about him leapt out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, visible, ghastly-white and astonished, terrified,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perspiring, in a livid glare. One face, a young man's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very near to him, not twenty inches away. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it was but a passing incident of no emotional value,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but afterwards it came back to him in his dreams. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">this young man, wedged upright in the crowd for a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been shot and was already dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fourth white star must have been lit by the man on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cable. Its light came glaring in through vast win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows and arches and showed Graham that he was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of a dense mass of flying black figures pressed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the lower area of the great theatre. This time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the picture was livid and fragmentary, slashed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred with black shadows. He saw that quite near to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him the red guards were fighting their way through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. He could not tell whether they saw him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked for Lincoln and his guards. He saw Lincoln near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stage of the theatre surrounded in a crowd of black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">badged revolutionaries, lifted up and staring to and fro</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if seeking him. Graham perceived that he himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">was near the opposite edge of the crowd, that behind him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated by a barrier, sloped the now vacant seats of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatre. A sudden idea came to him, and he began fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his way towards the barrier. As he reached it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare came to an end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment he had thrown off the great cloak that</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only impeded his movements but made him con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spicuous, and had slipped it from his shoulders. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard someone trip in its folds. In another, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scaling the barrier and had dropped into the blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the further side. Then feeling his way he came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower end of an ascending gangway. In the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of firing ceased and the roar of feet and voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">lulled. Then suddenly he came to an unexpected step</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tripped and fell. As he did so pools and islands</seg><seg type="columnLine">amidst the darkness about him leapt to vivid light again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the uproar surged louder and the glare of the fifth white</seg><seg type="columnLine">star shone through the vast fenestrations of the theatre</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A wild tumult tossed and whirled about him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the man stood still</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He rolled over among: some seats, heard a shouting an«</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whirring rattle of weapons, struggled up and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked back again, perceived that a number of black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">badged men were all about him firing at the reds below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping from seat to seat, crouching among the seats to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reload. Instinctively he crouched amidst the seats, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">stray shots ripped the pneumatic cushions and cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright slashes on their soft metal frames. Instinctively</seg><seg type="columnLine">he marked the direction of the gangways, the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">plausible way of escape for him so soon as the veil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness fell again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A young man in faded blue garments came vaulting</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the seats. "Hullo!" he said, with his flying feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">within six inches of the crouching Sleeper's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He stared without any sign of recognition, turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, fired, and, shouting, "To hell with the Council!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to fire again. Then it seemed to Graham that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the half of this man's neck had vanished. A drop of</seg><seg type="columnLine">moisture fell on Graham's cheek. The green weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped half raised. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his face suddenly ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressionless, then he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to slant forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">His knees bent. Man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness fell together. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of his fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham rose up and ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his life until a step</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the gangway</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripped him. He scram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled to his feet, turned up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gangway and ran on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the sixth star</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared he was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready close to the yawn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing throat of a passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He ran on the swifter for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light, entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage and turned a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner into absolute night</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He was knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideways, rolled over, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovered his feet. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself one of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd of invisible fugi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives pressing in one di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection. His one thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">now was their thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">also; to escape out of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting. He thrust and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Struck, staggered, ran,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wedged tightly, lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and then was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some minutes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was running through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness along a winding passage, and then he crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">some wide and open space, passed down a long incline,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came at last down a flight of steps to a level place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many people were shouting, "They are coming! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards are coming. They are firing. Get out of the fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The guards are firing. It will be safe in Seventh Way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along here to Seventh Way!" There were women and</seg><seg type="columnLine">children in the crowd as well as men. Men called names</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. The crowd converged on an archway, passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a short throat and emerged on a wider space</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, lit dimly. The black figures about him spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and ran up what seemed in the twilight to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic series of steps. He followed. The people dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">persed to the right and left. ... He perceived that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was no longer in a crowd. He stopped near the high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est step. Before him, on that level, were groups of seats</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little kiosk. He went up to this and, stopping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow of its eaves, looked about him panting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything was vague and gray, but he recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these great steps were a series of platforms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"ways," now motionless again. The platform slanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on either side, and the tall buildings rose beyond, vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim ghosts, their inscriptions and advertisements indis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctly seen, and up through the girders and cables was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint interrupted ribbon of pallid sky. A number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people hurried by. From their shouts and voices, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed they were hurrying to join the fighting. Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">less noisy figures flitted timidly among the shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From very far away down the street he could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of a struggle. But it was evident to him that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not the street into which the theatre opened. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">former fight, it seemed, had suddenly dropped out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound and hearing. And--grotesque thought!--they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fighting for him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a space he was like a man who pauses in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading of a vivid book, and suddenly doubts what he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had been taking unques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionably. At that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had little mind for de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails; the whole effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a huge astonishment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oddly enough, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight from the Council</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison, the great crowd in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hall, and the attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the red police upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swarming people</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clearly present in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind, it cost him an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to piece in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakening and to revive</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meditative interval of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Silent Rooms. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first his memory leapt</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">him back to the cascade</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Pentargen quivering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind and all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sombre splendors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlit Cornish coast. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrast touched every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing with unreality. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the gap filled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began to comprehend</seg><seg type="columnLine">his position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was no longer abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely a riddle, as it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in the Silen' Rooms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least he had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, bare outline now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was in some way the</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner of half the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and great political parties</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fighting to possess him. On the one hand was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Council, with its red police, set resolutely, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, on the usurpation of his property and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">his murder; on the other, the revolution that had liber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated him, with this unseen "Ostrog" as its leader. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole of this gigantic city was convulsed by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle. Frantic development of his world! "I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand," he cried. "I do not understand!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had slipped out between the contending parties</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this liberty of the twilight. What would happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">next? What was happening? He figured the red-clad</seg><seg type="columnLine">men as busily hunting him, driving the black-badged</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolutionists before them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any rate chance had given him a breathing space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could lurk unchallenged by the passers-by, and watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course of things. His eye followed up the intricate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">small, bunchcd-up figure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">81</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dim immensity of the twilight buildings, and it came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as a thing infinitely wonderful, that above there the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun was rising, and the world was lit and glowing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old familiar light of day. In a little while he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovered his breath. His clothing had already dried</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him from the snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wandered for miles along these twilight ways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking to no one, accosted by no one--a dark figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">among dark figures--the coveted man out of the past,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inestimable unintentional owner of half the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wherever there were lights or dense crowds, or excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional excitement he was afraid of recognition, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched and turned back or went up and down by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle stairways, into some transverse system of ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a lower or higher level. And though he came on no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more fighting, the whole city stirred with battle. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had to run to avoid a marching multitude of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">that swept the street. Everyone abroad seemed involved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the most part they were men, and they carried what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he judged were weapons. It seemed as though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle was concentrated mainly in the quarter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city from which he came. Ever and again a distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring, the remote suggestion of that conflict, reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears. Then his caution and his curiosity struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. But his caution prevailed, and he continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandering away from the fighting--so far as he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge. He went unmolested, unsuspected through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark. After a time he ceased to hear even a remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">echo of the battle, fewer and fewer people passed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until at last the Titanic streets became deserted. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">frontages of the buildings grew plain and harsh; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have come to a district of vacant warehouses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solitude crept upon him--his pace slackened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He became aware of a growing fatigue. At times</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would turn aside and seat himself on one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous seats of the upper ways. But a feverish</seg><seg type="columnLine">restlessness, the knowledge of his vital implication in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this struggle, would not let him rest in any place for</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. Was the struggle on his behalf alone?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then in a desolate place came the shock of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthquake--a roaring and thundering--a mighty wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cold air pouring through the city, the smash of glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slip and thud of falling masonry--a series of gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">concussions. A mass of glass and ironwork fell from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remote roofs into the middle gallery, not a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards away from him, and in the distance were shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and running. He, too, was startled to an aimless activity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran first one way and then as aimlessly back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man came running towards him. His self-control re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. "What have they blown up?" asked the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathlessly. "That was an explosion," and before Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham could speak he had hurried on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great buildings rose dimly, veiled by a perplexing</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight, albeit the rivulet of sky above was now bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">with day. He noted many strange features, understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing none at the time; he even spelt out many of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scriptions in Phonetic lettering. But what profits it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">decipher a confusion of odd-looking letters resolving it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, after painful strain of eye and mind, into "Here is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eadhamite," or "Labor Bureau--Little Side?" Gro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tesque thought, that in all probability some or all of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff-like houses were his!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The perversity of his experience came to him vividly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In actual fact he had made such a leap in time as romanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers have imagined again and again. And that fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized, he had been prepared, his mind had, as it were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated itself for a spectacle. And no spectacle, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great vague danger, unsympathetic shadows and veils of</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. Somewhere through the labyrinthine obscurity</seg><seg type="columnLine">his death sought him. Would he, after all, be killed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he saw? It might be that even at the next shadowy</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner his destruction ambushed. A great desire to see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great longing to know, arose in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He became fearful of corners. It seemed to him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was safety in concealment. Where could he hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be inconspicuous when the lights returned? At last</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sat down upon a seat in a recess on one of the higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, conceiving he was alone there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He squeezed his knuckles into his weary eyes. Suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he looked again he found the dark trough of parallel</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways and that intolerable altitude of edifice, gone? Sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose he were to discover the whole story of these last few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, the awakening, the shouting multitudes, the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and the fighting, a phantasmagoria, a new and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid sort of dream. It must be a dream; it was so in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consecutive, so reasonless. Why were the people fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him? Why should this saner world regard him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Owner and Master?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he thought, sitting blinded, and then he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, half hoping in spite of his ears to see some famil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iar aspect of the life of the nineteenth century, to see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, the little harbor of Boscastle about him, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs of Pentargen, or the bedroom of hi3 home.

"None," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I stay here till the lights come again," said the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. "These blue scoundrels are everywhere--every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham's answer was inarticulate assent. He tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the old man but the darkness hid his face. He wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much to respond, to talk, but he did not know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to begin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dark and damnable," said the old man suddenly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dark and damnable.

"That's hard on you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Darkness. An old man lost in the darkness. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the world gone mad.

No more dark passages</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me. I fell over a dead man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're safer with company," said the old man, "if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's company of the right sort," and peered frankly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose suddenly and came towards Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently the scrutiny was satisfactory. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man sat down as if relieved to be no longer alone. "Eh 1"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "but this is a terrible time!

"The Council has few</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends among the people," he hazarded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Few friends.

"This Sleeper," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Graham. "Well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The senile voice sank to a confidential whisper, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim, pale face came close. "The real Sleeper--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Died years ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" said Graham, sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Years ago.

I musn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell all I know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a little while he muttered inaudibly. His secret was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much for him. "I don't know the ones that put him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep--that was before my time--but I know the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who injected the stimulants and woke him again. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten to one--wake or kill. Wake or kill. Ostrog's way."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham was so astonished at these things that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to interrupt, to make the old man repeat his words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to re-question vaguely, before he was sure of the mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and folly of what he heard. And his awakening had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been natural! Was that an old man's senile supersti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, too, or had it any truth in it? Feeling in the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners of his memory, he presently came on something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might conceivably be an impression of some such</seg><seg type="columnLine">stimulating effect. It dawned upon him that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened upon a lucky encounter, that at last he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn something of the new age. The old man wheezed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while and spat, and then the piping, reminiscent voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The first time they rejected him.

"Fighting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaying, and weapons in hand, and fools bawling freedom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the like," said the old man. "Not in all my life has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there been that. These are like the old days--for sure--</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the Paris people broke out--three gross of years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. That's what I mean hasn't been. But it's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's way. It had to come back. I know. I know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This five years Ostrog has been working, and there has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been trouble and trouble, and hunger and threats and</seg><seg type="columnLine">high talk and arms. Blue canvas and murmurs. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">one safe. Everything sliding and slipping. And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">here we are! Revolt and fighting, and the Council come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are rather well-informed in these things," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know what I hear. It isn't all Babble Machine with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Graham, wondering what Babble Machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be. "And you are certain this Ostrog--you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain Ostrog organized this rebellion and arranged for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waking of the Sleeper? Just to assert himself--</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he was not elected to the Council?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everyone knows that, I should think," said the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. "Except--just fools. He meant to be master some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how. In the Council or not. Everyone who knows any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing knows that. And here we are with dead bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying in the dark! Why, where have you been if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't heard all about the trouble between Ostrog and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Verneys? And what do you think the troubles are</seg><seg type="columnLine">about? The Sleeper. Eh? You think the Sleeper's real</seg><seg type="columnLine">and woke of his own accord--eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm a dull man, older than I look, and forgetful," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham. "Lots of things that have happened--especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">of late years--. If I was the Sleeper, to tell you the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth, I couldn't know less about them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh!" said the voice. "Old, are you? You don't sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">so very old! But it's not everyone keeps his memory to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my time of life--truly. But these notorious things!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But you're not so old as me--not nearly so old as me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well! I ought not to judge other men by myself, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps. I'm young--for so old a man. Maybe you're old</seg><seg type="columnLine">for so young."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's it," said Graham. "And I've a queer history.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know very little. And history! Practically I know no</seg><seg type="columnLine">history. The Sleeper and Julius Caesar are all the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. It's interesting to hear you talk of these things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know a few things," said the old man. "I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing or two. But--. Hark!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE two men became silent, listening. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavy thud, a concussion that made their seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiver. The passers-by stopped, shouted to one another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old man was full of questions; he shouted to a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who passed near. Graham, emboldened by his example,</seg><seg type="columnLine">got up and accosted others. None knew what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned to the seat and found the old man mutter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing vague interrogations in an undertone. For a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">they said nothing to one another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sense of this gigantic struggle, so near and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">so remote oppressed Graham's imagination. Was this</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man right, was the report of the people right, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the revolutionaries winning? Or were they all in</seg><seg type="columnLine">error, and were the red guards driving all before them?</seg><seg type="columnLine">At any time the flood of warfare might pour into this</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent quarter of the city and seize upon him again. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">behooved him to learn all he could while there was time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned suddenly to the old man with a question and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left it unsaid. But his motion moved the old man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh! but how things work together!" said the old man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This Sleeper that all the fools put their trust in I I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole history of it--I was always a good one for</seg><seg type="columnLine">histories. When I was a boy--I'm that old--I used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read printed books. You'd hardly think it.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've traced all the Sleeper business from the first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will scarcely believe it," said Graham slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm so ignorant--I've been so preoccupied in my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">little affairs, my circumstances have been so odd--I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of this Sleeper's history. Who was he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh!" said the old man. "I know. I know. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a poor nobody, and set on a playful woman, poor soul!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he fell into a trance. There's the old things they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, those brown things--silver photographs--still show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him as he lay, a gross and a half years ago--a gross</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a half of years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Set on a playful woman, poor soul," said Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly to himself, and then aloud, "Yes--well! go on."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You must know he had a cousin named Warming, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitary man without children, who made a big fortune</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculating in roads--the first Eadhamite roads. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely you've heard? No? Why? He bought all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patent rights and made a big company. In those days</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were grosses of grosses of separate businesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and business companies. Grosses of grosses! His roads</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed the railroads--the old things--in two dozen years;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he bought up and Eadhamited the tracks. And because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want to break up his great property or let in share-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holders, he left it all to the Sleeper, and put it under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Board of Trustees that he had picked and trained. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew then the Sleeper wouldn't wake, that he would go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping, sleeping till he died. He knew that quite well!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And plump! a man in the United States, who had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">two sons in a boat accident, followed that up with an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other great bequest.

"Why, I don't even know</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course not," said the old man. "Of course not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">People don't learn much in the school nowadays. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know all about him.

That I don't know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something about pictures by machinery. But he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and left it, and so the Council had its start. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a council of trustees at first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And how did it grow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh!--but you're not up to things.

And for years the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve trustees hid the growing of the Sleeper's estate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under double names and company titles and all that. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council spread by title deed, mortgage, share, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">political party, ev^ry newspaper, they bought. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen to the old stories you will see the Council growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and growing.

"Listen," he said. "I am the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleeper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're an odd man," said the old man, "to sit here</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dark, talking clipped, and telling a lie of that sort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham's exasperation fell to laughter. "It is pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posterous," he cried. "Preposterous. The dream must</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. It gets wilder and wilder. Here am I--in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned twilight--I never knew a dream in twilight be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore--an anachronism by two hundred years and trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to persuade an old fool that I am myself, and meanwhile</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--	Uhg!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved in gusty irritation and went striding. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the old man was pursuing him. "Eh! but don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">go!" cried the old man. "I'm an old fool, I know. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">go. Don't leave me in all this darkness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham hesitated, stopped. Suddenly the folly of tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his secret flashed into his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't mean to offend you--disbelieving you," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man coming near. "It's no manner of harm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Call yourself the Sleeper if it pleases you. 'Tis a foolish</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham hesitated, turned abruptly and went on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time he heard the old man's hobbling pursuit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his wheezy cries receding. But at last the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed him and Graham saw him no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ostrog</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GRAHAM could now take a clearer view of his posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. For a long time yet he wandered, but after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the talk of the old man his discovery of this Ostrog</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear in his mind as the final inevitable decision.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One thing was evident, those, who were at the head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters of the revolt had succeeded very admirably in</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppressing the fact of his disappearance. But every</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he expected to hear the report of his death or of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his recapture by the Council.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently a man stopped before him. "Have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No I" said Graham starting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Near a dozand," said the man, "a dozand men!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A number of men and a girl passed in the darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesticulating and shouting: "Capitulated! Given up!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A dozand of men." "Two dozand of men." "Ostrog,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurrah! Ostrog, Hurrah!" These cries receded, became</seg><seg type="columnLine">indistinct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Other shouting men followed. For a time his atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was absorbed in the fragments of speech he heard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a doubt whether all were speaking English.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scraps floated to him, scraps like Pigeon English, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">'nigger' dialect, blurred and mangled distortions. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared accost no one with questions. The impression the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people gave him jarred altogether with his preconceptions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the struggle and confirmed the old man's faith in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ostrog. It was only slowly he could bring himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that all these people were rejoicing at the defeat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Council, that the Council which had pursued him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such power and vigor was after all the weaker cf</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the two sides in conflict. And if that was so, how did</seg><seg type="columnLine">it affect him? Several times he hesitated on the verge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fundamental questions. Once he turned and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long way after a little man of rotund inviting out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, but he was unable to master confidence to address</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only slowly that it came to him that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">«sk for the "wind-vane offices," whatever the "wind-vane</seg><seg type="columnLine">offices" might be. His first inquiry simply resulted in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">o	direction to go on towards Westminster. His second</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to the discovery of a short cut in which he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily lost. He was told to leave the ways to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie had hitherto confined himself--no other means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">transit--and to plunge down one of the middle stair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases into the blackness of a crossway. Thereupon came</seg><seg type="columnLine">some trivial adventures; chief of these an ambiguous</seg><seg type="columnLine">encounter with a gruff-voiced invisible creature speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a strange dialect that seemed at first a strange tongue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thick flow of speech with the drifting corpses of Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish words therein, the dialect of the latter-day vile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then another voice drew near, a girl's voice singing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"tralala tralala." She spoke to Graham, her English</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched with something of the same quality. She pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessed to have lost her sister, she blundered needlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into him he thought, caught hold of him and laughed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But a word of vague remonstrance sent her into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseen again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sounds about him increased. Stumbling people</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed him, speaking excitedly. "They have surren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered!" "The Council! Surely not the Council!" "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are saying so in the Ways." The passage seemed wider.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the wall fell away. He was in a great space</seg><seg type="columnLine">and people were stirring remotely. He inquired his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of an indistinct figure. "Strike straight across,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said a woman's voice. He left his guiding wall, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment had stumbled against a little table on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were utensils of glass. Graham's eyes, now attuned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to darkness, made out a long vista with pallid tables</seg><seg type="columnLine">on either side. He went down this. At one or two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tables he heard a clang of glass and a sound of eat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. There were people then cool enough to dine, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">daring enough to steal a meal in spite of social con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsion and darkness. Far off and high up he presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a pallid light of a semi-circular shape. As he ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached this, a black edge came up and hid it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled at steps and found himself in a gallery. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a sobbing, and found two scared little girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched by a railing. These children became silent at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the near sound of feet. He tried to console them, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were very still until he left them. Then as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">receded he could hear them sobbing again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he found himself at the foot of a staircase</seg><seg type="columnLine">and near a wide opening. He saw a dim twilight above</seg><seg type="columnLine">this and ascended out of the blackness into a street of</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving Ways again. Along this a disorderly swarm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people marched shouting. They were singing snatches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the song of the revolt, most of them out of tune.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here and there torches flared creating brief hysterical</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows. He asked his way and was twice puzzled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">that same thick dialect. His third attempt won an</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer he could understand. He was two miles from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind-vane offices in Westminster, but the way was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy to follow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When at last he did approach the district of the wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vane offices it seemed to him, from the cheering pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessions that came marching along the Ways, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumult of rejoicing, and finally from the restoration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lighting of the city, that the overthrow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council must already be accomplished. And still no</seg><seg type="columnLine">news of his absence came to his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The re-illumination of the city came with startling</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptness. Suddenly he stood blinking, all about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">men halted dazzled, and the world was incandescent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light found him already upon the outskirts of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">excited crowds that choked the Ways near the wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vane offices, and the sense of visibility and exposure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that came with it turned his colorless intention of join-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Ostrog to a keen anxiety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time he was jostled, obstructed, and endan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered by men hoarse and weary with cheering his name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them bandaged and bloody in his cause. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">frontage of the wind-vane offices was illuminated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some moving picture, but what it was he could not see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because in spite of his strenuous attempts the density</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crowd prevented his approaching it. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments of speech he caught, he judged it conveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">news of the fighting about the Council House. Ignor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance and indecision made him slow and ineffective in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his movements. For a time he could not conceive how</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was to get within the unbroken facade of this place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He made his way slowly into the midst of this mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, until he realized that the descending staircase</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the central Way led to the interior of the building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This gave him a goal, but the crowding in the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">path was so dense that it was long before he could reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. And even then he encountered intricate obstruction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had an hour of vivid argument first in this guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and then in that before he could get a note taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the one man of all men who was most eager to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. His story was laughed to scorn at one place, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiser for that, when at last he reached a second stair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he professed simply to have news of extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance for Ostrog. What it was he would not say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They sent his note reluctantly. For a long time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited in a little room at the foot of the lift shaft, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thither at last came Lincoln, eager, apologetic, aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished. He stopped in the doorway scrutinizing Graham,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then rushed forward effusively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he cried. "It is you. And you are not dead!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham made a brief explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"IV/TY brother is waiting," explained Lincoln. "He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> IV! is alone in the wind-vane offices. We feared you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been killed in the theatre. He doubted--and things</seg><seg type="columnLine">are very urgent still in spite of what we are telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">them there--or he would have come to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They ascended a lift, passed along a narrow passage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed a great hall, empty save for two hurrying mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers, and entered a comparatively little room, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">only furniture was a long settee and a large oval disc</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cloudy, shifting grey, hung by cables from the wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There Lincoln left Graham for a space, and he remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone without understanding the shifting smoky shapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that drove slowly across this disc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His attention was arrested by a sound that began</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly. It was cheering, the frantic cheering of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast but very remote crowd, a roaring exultation. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended as sharply as it had begun, like a sound heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the opening and shutting of a door. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer room was a noise of hurrying steps and a melodious</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinking as if a loose chain was running over the teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he heard the voice of a woman, the rustle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseen garments. "It is Ostrog!" he heard her say. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bell rang fitfully, and then everything was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently came voices, footsteps and movement with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. The footsteps of some one person detached itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the other sounds and drew near, firm, evenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">measured steps. The curtain lifted slowly. A tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-haired man, clad in garments of cream-colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk, appeared, regarding Graham from under his raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment the white form remained holding thg</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtain, then dropped it and stood before it. Graham's</seg><seg type="columnLine">first impression was of a very broad forehead, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale blue eyes deep sunken under white brows, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">aquiline nose, and a heavily-lined resolute mouth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">86</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">folds of flesh over the eyes, the drooping of the corners</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mouth contradicted the upright bearing, and said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man was old. Graham rose to his feet instinctively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for a moment the two men stood in silence, regard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are Ostrog?" said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Ostrog."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Boss?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I am called."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham felt the inconvenience of the silence. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to thank you chiefly, I understand, for my safety,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said presently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"We were afraid you were killed," said Ostrog. "Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to sleep again--for ever. We have been doing every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to keep our secret--the secret of your disappear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance. Where have you been? How did you get here?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham told him briefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ostrog listened in silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled faintly. "Do you know what I was doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they came to tell me you had come?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can I guess?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Preparing your double."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My double?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man as like you as we could find. We were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hypnotize him, to save him the difficulty of acting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was imperative. The whole of this revolt depends</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the idea that you are awake, alive, and with us. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now a great multitude of people has gathered in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatre clamoring to see you. They do not trust . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">You know, of course--something of your position?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Very little," said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is like this." Ostrog walked a pace or two into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room and turned. "You are absolute owner," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "of more than half the world. As a result of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are practically King. Your powers are limited in</seg><seg type="columnLine">many intricate ways, but you are the figure-head, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular symbol of government. This White Council, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council of Trustees as it is called--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have heard the vague outline of these things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wondered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I came upon a garrulous old man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see . . . Our masses--the word comes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">your days--you know of course, that we still have</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses--regard you as our actual ruler. Just as a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of people in your days regarded the Crown as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ruler. They are discontented--the masses all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth--with the rule of your Trustees. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part it is the old discontent, the old quarrel of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">common man with his commonness--the misery of work</seg><seg type="columnLine">and discipline and unfitness. But your Trustees have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruled ill. In certain matters, in the administration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Labor Companies, for example, they have been un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise. They have given endless opportunities. Already</seg><seg type="columnLine">we of the popular party were agitating for reforms--</seg><seg type="columnLine">when your waking came. Came! If it had been con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trived it could not have come more opportunely." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled. "The public mind, making no allowance for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your years of quiescence, had already hit on the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of waking you and appealing to you, and--Flash!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He indicated the outbreak by a gesture, and Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved his head to show that he understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Council muddled--quarrelled. They always do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could not decide what to do with you. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how they imprisoned you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see. I see. And now--we win?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We win. Indeed we win. Tonight, in five swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours. Suddenly we struck everywhere. The wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vane people, the Labor Company and its millions, burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bonds. We got the pull of the aeropiles."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused. "Yes," said Graham, guessing that aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile meant flying machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was, of course, essential. Or they could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">got away. All the city rose, every third man almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in it! All the blue, all the public services, save only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">just a few aeronauts and about half the red police. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rescued, and their own police of the Ways--not</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of them could be massed at the Council House--*</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been broken up, disarmed or killed. All London</seg><seg type="columnLine">is ours--now. Only the Council House remains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Half of those who remain to them of the red police</seg><seg type="columnLine">wero lost in that foolish attempt "to recapture you. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost their heads when they lost you. They flung all they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had at the theatre. We cut them off from the Council</seg><seg type="columnLine">House there. Truly tonight has been a night of vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. Everywhere your star has blazed. A day ago--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Council ruled as it has ruled for a gross of</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, for a century and a half of years, and then, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a little whispering, a covert arming here and there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly--So I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am very ignorant," said Graham. "I suppose--. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not clearly understand the conditions of this fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. If you could explain. Where is the Council?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where is the fight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ostrog stepped across the room, something clicked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and suddenly, save for an oval glow, they were in dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. For a moment Graham was puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he saw that the cloudy grey disc had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth and color, had assumed the appearance of an oval</seg><seg type="columnLine">window looking out upon a strange unfamiliar scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the first glance he was unable to guess what this</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene might be. It was a daylight scene, the daylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a wintry day, grey and clear. Across the picture and</seg><seg type="columnLine">halfway as it seemed between him and remoter view, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stout cable of twisted white wire stretched vertically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he perceived that the rows of great wind-wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw, the wide intervals, the occasional gulfs of dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, were akin to those through which he had fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Council House. He distinguished an orderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">file of red figures marching across an open space be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween files of men in black and realized before Ostrog</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke that he was looking down on the upper surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter-day London. The overnight snows had gone. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged that this mirror was some modern replacement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the camera obscura, but that matter was not ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained to him. He saw that though the file of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures was trotting from left to right, yet they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing out of the picture to the left. He wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily, and then saw that the picture was pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing slowly, panorama fashion, across the oval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a moment you will see the fighting," said Ostrog</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his elbow. "Those fellows in red you notice are pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oners. This is the roof space of London--all the houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">are practically continuous now. The streets and public</seg><seg type="columnLine">squares are covered in. The gaps and chasms of youf</seg><seg type="columnLine">time have disappeared."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOMETHING out of focus obliterated half the picture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its form suggested a man. There was a gleam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, a flash, something that swept across the oval, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyelid of a bird sweeps across its eye, and the pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture was clear again. And now Graham beheld men</seg><seg type="columnLine">running down among the wind-wheels, pointing weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which jetted out little smoky flashes. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarmed thicker and thicker to the right, gesticulating</seg><seg type="columnLine">--it might be they were shouting, but of that the pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture told nothing. They and the wind-wheels passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly and steadily across the field of the mirror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," said Ostrog, "comes the Council House," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly a black edge crept into view and gathered Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham's attention. Soon it was no longer an edge hut a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavity, a huge blackened space amidst the clustering</seg><seg type="columnLine">edifices, and from it thin spires of smoke rose into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pallid winter sky. Gaunt ruinous masses of the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, mighty truncated piers and girders, rose dismally</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of this cavernous darkness. And over these vestige3</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some splendid place, countless minute men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambering, leaping, swarming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the Council House," said Ostrog. "Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">last stronghold. And the fools wasted enough ammu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nition to hold out for a month in blowing up the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings all about them--to stop our attack. You heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smash? It shattered half the brittle glass in the city."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And while he spoke, Graham saw that beyond this</seg><seg type="columnLine">area of ruins, overhanging it and rising to a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">height, was a ragged mass of white building. This mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been isolated by the ruthless destruction of its sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings. Black gaps marked the passages the disaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">had torn apart; big halls had been slashed open and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decoration of their interiors showed dismally in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wintry dawn, and down the jagged walls hung festoons</seg><seg type="columnLine">of divided cables and twisted ends of lines and metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods. And amidst .ill the vast details moved little red</seg><seg type="columnLine">specks, the red-clothed defenders of the Council. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then faint flashes illuminated the bleak shadows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the first sight it seemed to Graham that an attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon this isolated white building was in progress, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he perceived that the party of the revolt was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing, but sheltered amidst the colossal wreckage</seg><seg type="columnLine">that encircled this last ragged stronghold of the red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garbed men, was keeping up a fitful firing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And not ten hours ago he had stood beneath the venti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating fans in a little chamber within that remote build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wondering what was happening in the world!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking more attentively as this warlike episode</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved silently across the centre of the mirror, Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that the white building was surrounded on every</seg><seg type="columnLine">side by ruins, and Ostrog proceeded to describe in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cise phrases how its defenders had sought by such de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction to isolate themselves from a storm. He spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the loss of men that huge downfall had entailed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an indifferent tone. He indicated an improvised mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuary among the wreckage, showed ambulances swarm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like cheese-mites along a ruinous groove that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once been a street of moving ways. He was more inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested in pointing out the parts of the Council House,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distribution of the besiegers. In a little while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">civil contest that had convulsed London was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mystery to Graham. It was no-tumultuous revolt had</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred that night, no equal warfare, but a splendidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">organized coup d'Stat. Ostrog's grasp of details was</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishing; he seemed to know the business of even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smallest knot of black and red specks that crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">amidst these places.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stretched a huge black arm across the luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture, and showed the room whence Graham had</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped, and across the chasm of ruins the course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his flight. Graham recognized the gulf across which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gutter ran, and the wind-wheels where he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched from the flying machine. The rest of his path</seg><seg type="columnLine">had succumbed to the explosion. He looked again at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council House, and it was already half hidden, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right a hillside with a cluster of domes and pin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nacles, hazy, dim and distant, was gliding into view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And the Council is really overthrown?" he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Overthrown," said Ostrog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I--. Is it indeed true that I--?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are Master of the World."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that white flag--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is the flag of the Council--the flag of the Rule</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the World. It will fall. The fight is over. Their at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack on the theatre was their last frantic struggle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have only a thousand men or so, and some of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">men will be disloyal. They have little ammunition. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are reviving the ancient arts. We are casting guns."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But--help. Is this city the world?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Practically this is all they have left to them of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">empire. Abroad the cities have either revolted with us</seg><seg type="columnLine">or wait the issue. Your awakening has perplexed them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzed them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But haven't the Council flying machines? Why is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there no fighting with them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They had. But the greater part of the aeronauts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the revolt with us. They wouldn't take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk of fighting on our side, but they would not stir</seg><seg type="columnLine">against us. We had to get a pull with the aeronauts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quite half were with us, and the others knew it. Directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew you had got away, those looking for you</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped. We killed the man who shot at you--an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. And we occupied the flying stages at the outset</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every city we could, and so stopped and captured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeroplanes, and as for the little flying machines that</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned out--for some did--we kept up too straight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady a fire for them to get near the Council House.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If they dropped they couldn't rise again, because there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no clear space about there for them to get up. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have smashed, several others have dropped and sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendered, the rest have gone off to the Continent to lind</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friendly city if they can before their fuel runs out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most of these men were only too glad to be taken pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner and kept out of harm's way. Upsetting in a flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine isn't a very attractive prospect. There's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance for the Council that way. Its days are done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed and turned to the oval reflection again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show Graham what he meant by flying stages. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four nearer ones were remote and obscured by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin morning haze. But Graham could perceive they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very vast structures, judged even by the standard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the things about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then as these dim shapes passed to the left there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came again the sight of the expanse across which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disarmed men in red had been marching. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black ruins, and then again the beleaguered white</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastness of the Council. It appeared no longer a ghostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile, but glowing amber in the sunlight, for a cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow had passed. About it the pigmy struggle still</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung in suspense, but now the red defenders were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer firing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO, in a dusky stillness, the man from the nineteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">century saw the closing scene of the great revolt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forcible establishment of his rule. With a quality</seg><seg type="columnLine">of startling discovery it came to him that this was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, and not that other he had left behind; that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no spectacle to culminate and ceasc; that in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">world lay whatever life was still before him; lay all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties and dangers and responsibilities. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fresh questions. Ostrog began to answer them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then broke off abruptly. "But these things I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain more fully later. At present there are--duties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The people are coming by the moving ways towards this</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward from every part of the city--the markets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatres are densely crowded. You are just in time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They are clamoring to see you. And abroad they</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to see you. Paris, New York, Chicago, Denver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capri--thousands of cities are up and in a tumult, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided, and clamoring to see you. They have clamored</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you should be awakened for years, and now it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">done they will scarcely believe--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But surely--I can't go . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ostrog answered from the other side of the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the picture on the oval disc paled and vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the light jerked back again. "There are kinetotele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographs," he said. "As you bow to the people here</seg><seg type="columnLine">--all over the world myriads of myriads of people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed and still in darkened halls, will see you also. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">black and white, of course--not like this. And you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear their shouts reinforcing the shouting in the hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And there is an optical contrivance we shall use,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Ostrog, "used by some of the posturers and women</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancers. It may be novel to you. You stand in a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright light, and they see not you but a magnified image</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you thrown on a screen--so that even the furtherest</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the remotest gallery can, if he chooses, count your</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyelashes."</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham clutched desperately at one of the questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his mind. "What is the population of London?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eight and twaindy myriads."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eight and what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More than thirty-three millions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These figures went beyond Graham's imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will be expected to say something," said Ostrog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not what you used to call a Speech, but what our</seg><seg type="columnLine">people call a Word--just one sentence, six or seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. Something formal. If I might suggest--'I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened and my heart is with you.' That is the sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thing they want."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was that?" asked Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'I am awakened and my heart is with you.' And</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow--bow royally. But first we must get you black</seg><seg type="columnLine">robes--for black is your color. Do you mind?

"I am in your hands," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ostrog was clearly of that opinion. He thought for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, turned to the curtain and called brief direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions to some unseen attendants. Almost immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">a black robe, the very fellow of the black robe Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">had worn in the theatre, was brought. And as he threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it about his shoulders there came from the room without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shrilling of a high-pitched bell. Ostrog turned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrogation to the attendant, then suddenly seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to change his mind, pulled the curtain aside and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Graham stood with the deferential at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendant listening to Ostrog's retreating steps. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sound of quick question and answer and of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">running. The curtain was snatched back and Ostrog</seg><seg type="columnLine">reappeared, his massive face glowing with excitement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He crossed the room in a stride, clicked the room into</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, gripped Graham's arm and pointed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even as we turned away," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham saw his index finger, black and colossal, above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mirrored Council House.

From this room came groans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wailing. He had an impression of an empty blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained couch, of men on other couches, bandaged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-stained. It was just a glimpse from a railed foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and then a buttress hid the place and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on towards the markets. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roar of the multitude was near now: it leapt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder. And, arresting his attention, a fluttering of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black banners, the waving of blue canvas and brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">rags, and the swarming vastness of the theatre near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the public markets came into view down a long passage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The picture opened out. He perceived they were enter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the great theatre of his first appearance, the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatre he had last seen as a chequer-work of glare and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness in his flight from the red police. This time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered it along a gallery at a level high above the stage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The place was now brilliantly lit again. He sought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gangway up which he had fled, but he could not tell it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from among its dozens of fellows; nor could he see any-,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of the smashed seats, deflated- cushions, and such</seg><seg type="columnLine">like traces of the fight because of the density of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. Except the stage the whole place was closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed. Looking down the effect was a vast area of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stippled pink, each dot a still upturned face regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. At his appearance with Ostrog the cheering died</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, the singing died away, a common interest stilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unified the disorder. It seemed as though every in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual of those myriads was watching him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The End of the Old Order</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO far as Graham was able to judge, it was near mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day when the white banner of the Council fell. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">some hours had to elapse before it was possible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect the formal capitulation, and so after he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken his "Word" he retired to his new apartments</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wind-vane offices. The continuous excitement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last twelve hours had left him inordinately fatigued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even his curiosity was exhausted; for a space he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">inert and passive with open eyes, and for a space he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept. He was roused by two medical attendants, come</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared with stimulants to sustain him through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next occasion. After he had taken their drugs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed by their advice in cold water, he felt a rapid re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn of interest and energy, and was presently able and</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to accompany Ostrog through several miles (as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed) of passages, lifts, and slides to the closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene of the White Council's rule.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The way ran deviously through a maze of buildings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They came at last to a passage that curved about, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed broadening before him an oblong opening, clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot with sunset, and the ragged skyline of the ruinous</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council House. A tumult of shouts came drifting up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. In another moment they had come out high</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on the brow of the cliff of torn buildings that over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung the wreckage. The vast area opened to Graham's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, none the less strange and wonderful for the remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">view he had had of it in the oval mirror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This rudely amphitheatral space seemed now the bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter part of a mile to its outer edge. It was gold lit ob</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left hand, catching the sunlight, and below and tc</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right clear and cold in the shadow. Above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy grey Council House that stood in the midst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, the great black banner of the surrender still hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sluggish folds against the blazing sunset. Severed</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms, halls and passages gaped strangely, broken masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal projected dismally from the complex wreckage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast masses of twisted cable dropped like tangled sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weed, and from its base came a tumult of innumerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices, violent concussions, and the sound of trumpets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All about this great white pile was a ring of desolation;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smashed and blackened masses, the gaunt founda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions and ruinous lumber of the fabric that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed by the Council's orders, skeletons of girders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Titanic masses of wall, forests of stout pillars. Amongst</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sombre wreckage beneath, running water flashed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistened, and far away across the space, out of the midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a vague vast mass of buildings, there thrust the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted end of a water-main, two hundred feet in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, thunderously spouting a shining cascade. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere great multitudes of people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wherever there was space and foothold, people</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarmed, little people, small and minutely clear, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the sunset touched them to indistinguishable gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Vast masses of twisted cable dropped liko tangled soa-wced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They clambered up the tottering walla, they clung in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreaths and groups about the high-standing pillars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They swarmed along the edges of the circle of ruins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The air was full of their shouting, and they were press-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and swaying towards the central space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The upper stories of the Council House seemed de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted, not a human being was visible. Only the droop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing banner of the surrender hung heavily against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. The dead were within the Council House, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden by the swarming people, or carried away. Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham could see only a few neglected bodies in gaps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners of the ruins, and amidst the flowing water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you let them see you, Sire?" said Ostrog. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are very anxious to see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham hesitated, and then walked forward to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broken verge of wall dropped sheer. He stood look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down, a lonely, tall, black figure against the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very slowly the swarming ruins became aware of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as they did so little bands of black-uniformed men</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared remotely, thrusting through the crowds to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the Council House. He saw little black heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">become pink, looking at him, saw by that means a wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">of recognition sweep across the space. It occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that he should accord them some recognition. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">held up his arm, then pointed to the Council House and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped his hand. The voices below became unanimous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered volume, came up to him as multitudinous wave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets of cheering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The western sky was a pallid bluish green, and Jupiter</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone high in the south, before the capitulation was ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished. Above was a slow insensible change, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance of night serene and beautiful; below was hurry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement, conflicting orders, pauses, spasmodic de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopments of organization, a vast ascending clamor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion. Before the Council came out, toiling per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiring men, directed by a conflict of shouts, carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth hundreds of those who had perished in the hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-hand conflict within those long passages and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chambers. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Guards in black lined the way that the Council would</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">come, and as far as the eye could reach into the hazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue twilight of the ruins, and swarming now at every</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible point in the captured Council House and along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shattered cliff of its circumadjacent buildings, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">innumerable people, and their voices even when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not cheering, were as the soughing of the sea upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pebble beach. Ostrog had chosen a huge commanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile of crushed and overthrown masonry, and on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stage of timbers and metal girders was being hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed. Its essential parts were complete, but hum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming and clangorous machinery still glared fitfully in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows beneath this temporary edifice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stage had a small higher portion on which Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham stood with Ostrog and Lincoln close beside him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little in advance of a group of minor officers. A broader</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower stage surrounded this quarter deck, and on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the black-uniformed guards of the revolt armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the little green weapons whose very names Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">still did not know. Those standing about him perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his eyes wandered perpetually from the swarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">people in the twilight ruins about him to the darkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of the White Council House, whence the Trustees</seg><seg type="columnLine">would presently come, and to the gaunt cliffs of ruin</seg><seg type="columnLine">that encircled him, and so back to the people. The voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crowd swelled to a deafening tumult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He saw the Councillors first afar off in the glare of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the temporary lights that marked their path, a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of white figures blinking in a black archway. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Council House they had been in darkness. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched them approaching, drawing nearer past first</seg><seg type="columnLine">this blazing electric star and then that; the minatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of the crowd over whom their power had lasted for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred and fifty years marched along beside them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As they drew still nearer their faces came out weary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white and anxious. He saw them blinking up through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glare about him and Ostrog. He contrasted their</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange cold looks in the Hall of Atlas. . . . Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently he could recognize several of them; the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had rapped the table at Howard, a burly man with a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard, and one delicate-featured, short, dark man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiarly long skull. He noted that two were whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pering together and looking behind him at Ostrog. Next</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came a tall, dark and handsome man, walking down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast. Abruptly he glanced up, his eyes touched Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, and passed beyond him to Ostrog. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">way that had been made for them was so contrived that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had to march past and curve about before they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sloping path of planks that ascended to the stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">where their surrender was to be made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Master, the Master! God and the Master,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted the people. "To hell with the Council!" Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham looked at their multitudes, receding beyond count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into a shouting haze, and then at Ostrog beside him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white and steadfast and still. His eye went again to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little group of White Councillors. And then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up at the familiar quiet stars overhead. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous element in his fate was suddenly vivid. Could</seg><seg type="columnLine">that be his indeed, that little life in his memory two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years gone by--and this as well?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the Crow's Nest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND so after strange delays and through an avenue</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doubt and battle, this man from the nineteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">century came at last to his position at the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that complex world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first when he rose from the long deep sleep that</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed his rescue and the surrender of the Council,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not recognize his surroundings. By an effort he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained a clue in his mind, and all that had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back to him, at first with a quality of insincerity</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like a story heard, like something read out of a book.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And even before his memories were clear, the exulta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of his escape, the wonder of his prominence were</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in his mind. He was owner of half the world;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master of the Earth. This new great age was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">completest sense his. He no longer hoped to discover</seg><seg type="columnLine">his experiences a dream; he became anxious now to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vince himself that they were real.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An obsequious vale assisted him to dress under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of a dignified chief attendant, a little man</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose face proclaimed him Japanese, albeit he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">English like an Englishman. From the latter he learnt</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of the state of affairs. Already the revolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was an accepted fact; already business was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed throughout the city. Abroad the downfall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Council had been received for the most part with de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Nowhere was the Council popular, and the thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand cities of Western America, after two hundred years</seg><seg type="columnLine">still jealous of New York, London, and the East, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">risen almost unanimously two days before at the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Graham's imprisonment. Paris was fighting within</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself. The rest of the world hung in suspense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While he was breaking his fast, the sound of a tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone bell jetted from a corner, and his chief attendant</seg><seg type="columnLine">called his attention to the voice of Ostrog making polite</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiries. Graham interrupted his refreshment to reply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very shortly Lincoln arrived, and Graham at once ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed a strong desire to talk to people and to be shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the new life that was opening before him. Lin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coln informed him that in three hours' time a repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentative gathering of officials and their wives would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">held in the state apartments of the wind-vane Chief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham's desire to traverse the ways of the city was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, at present impossible, because of the enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement of the people. It was, however, quite possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to take a bird's-eye view of the city from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crow's nest of the wind-vane keeper. To this accordingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham was conducted by his- attendant. Lincoln, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a graceful compliment to the attendant, apologized for</seg><seg type="columnLine">not accompanying them, on account of the present pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of administrative work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Higher even than the most gigantic wind-wheels hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">this crow's nest, a clear thousand feet above the roofs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little disc-shaped speck on a spear of metallic filigree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable stayed. To its summit Graham was drawn in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little wire-hung cradle. Halfway down the frail-seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem was a light gallery about which hung a cluster</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tubes--minute they looked from above--rotating</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly oii the ring of its outer rail. These were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">specula, era rapport with the wind-vane keeper's mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rors, in one of which Ostrog had shown him the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of his rule. His Japanese attendant ascended before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and they spent nearly an hour asking and answering</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a day full of the promise and quality of spring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The touch of the wind warmed. The sky was an intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue and the vast expanse of London shone dazzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the morning sun. The air was clear of smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and haze, sweet as the air of a mountain glen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Save for the irregular oval of ruins about the House</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Council and the black flag of the surrender that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluttered there, the mighty city seen from above showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">few signs of the swift revolution that had, to his imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ination, in one night and one day, changed the destinies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world. A multitude of people still swarmed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">these ruins, and the huge openwork stagings in the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance from which started in times of peace the service</seg><seg type="columnLine">of aeroplanes to the various great cities of Europe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">America, were also black with the victors. Across a nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row way of planking raised on trestles that crossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins a crowd of workmen were busy restoring the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection between the cables and wires of the Council</seg><seg type="columnLine">House and the rest of the city, preparatory to the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fer thither of Ostrog's headquarters from the Wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vane buildings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the rest the luminous expanse was undisturbed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So vast was its serenity in comparison with the areas</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disturbance, that presently Graham, looking beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, could almost forget the thousands of men lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight in the artificial glare within the quasi-sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terranean labyrinth, dead or dying of the overnight</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds, forget the improvised wards with the hosts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">surgeons, nurses, and bearer3 feverishly busy, forget,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, all the wonder, consternation and novelty under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the electric lights. Down there in the hidden ways of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the anthill he knew that the revolution triumphed, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">black everywhere carried the day, black favors, black ban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ners, black festoons across the streets. And out here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the fresh sunlight, beyond the crater of the fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if nothing had happened to the earth, the forest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wind Vanes that had grown from one or two while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council had ruled, roared peacefully upon their inces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sant duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far away, spiked, jagged and indented by the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanes, the Surrey Hills rose blue and faint; to the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nearer, the sharp contours of High gate and Mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well Hill were similarly jagged. And all over the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tryside, he knew, on every crest and hill, where once the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedges had interlaced, and cottages, churches, inns, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmhouses had nestled among their trees, wind wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to those he saw and bearing like them vast ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertisements, gaunt and distinctive symbols of the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, cast their whirling shadows and stored incessantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the energy that flowed away incessantly through all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arteries of the city. And underneath these wandered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the countless flocks and herds of the British Food Trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their lonely guards and keepers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Not a familiar outline anywhere broke the cluster of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic shapes below. St. Paul's he knew survived, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the old buildings in Westminster, embedded out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight, arched over and covered in among the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths of this great age. The Thames, too, made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall and gleam of silver to break the wilderness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city; the thirsty water mains drank up every drop of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters before they reached the walls. Its bed and estuary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoured and sunken, was now a canal of sea water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a race of grimy bargemen brought the heavy materials</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trade from the Pool thereby beneath the very feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the workers. Faint and dim in the eastward between</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth and sky hung the clustering masts of the colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipping in the Pool. For all the heavy traffic, for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no need of haste, came in gigantic sailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships from the ends of the earth, and the heavy goods</seg><seg type="columnLine">for which there was urgency in mechanical ships of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller swifter sort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And to the south over the hills, came vast aqueducts</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sea water for the sewers and in three separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions, ran pallid lines--the roads, stippled with mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing grey specks. On the first occasion that offered he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was determined to go out and see these roads. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come after the flying ship he was presently to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. His attendant officer described them as a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently curving surfaces a hundred yards wide, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">one for the traffic going in one direction, and made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a substance called Eadhamite--an artificial substance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far as he could gather, resembling toughened glass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along this shot a strange traf.lc of narrow rubber-shod</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicles, great single wheels, two and four wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicles, sweeping along at velocities of from one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">six miles a minute. Railroads had vanished; a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">embankments remained as rust-crowned trenches here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there. Some few formed the cores of Eadhamite</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Among the first things to strike his attention had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great fleets of advertisement balloons and kites that</seg><seg type="columnLine">receded in irregular vistas northward and southward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">along the lines of the aeroplane journeys. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeroplanes were to be seen. Their passages had ceased,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only one little-seeming aeropile circled high in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue distance above the Surrey Hills, an unimpressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">soaring speck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A THING Graham had already learnt, and which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found very hard to imagine, was that nearly all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the towns in the country, and almost all the villages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disappeared. Here and there only, he understood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some gigantic hotel-like edifice stood amid square miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some single cultivation and preserved the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a town--as Bournemouth, Wareham, or Swanage. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officer had speedily convinced him how inevitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a change had been. The old order had dotted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country with farmhouses, and every two or three miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the ruling landlord's estate, and the place of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inn and cobbler, the grocer's shop and church--the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage. Every eight miles or so was the country town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where lawyer, corn merchant, wool-stapler, saddler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">veterinary surgeon, doctor, draper, milliner and so forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived. Every eight miles--simply because that eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile marketing journey, four there and back, was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as was comfortable for the farmer. But directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railways came into play, and after them the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">railways, and all the swift new motor cars that had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed wagons and horses, and so soon as the high roads</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to be made of wood, and rubber, and Eadhamite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all sorts of elastic durable substances--the necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of having such frequent market towns disappeared. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big towns grew. They drew the worker with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational force of seemingly endless work, the em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployer with their suggestions of an infinite ocean of</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And as the standard of comfort rose, as the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexity of the mechanism of living increased, life in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country had become more and more costly, or narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and impossible. The disappearance of vicar and squire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extinction of the general practitioner by the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">specialist, had robbed the village of its last touch of cul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. After telephone, kinematograph and phonograph</seg><seg type="columnLine">had replaced newspaper, book, schoolmaster, and letter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live outside the range of the electric cables was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live an isolated savage. In the country were neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of being clothed nor fed (according to the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fined conceptions of the time), no efficient doctors for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an emergency, no company and no pursuits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'Moreover, mechanical appliances in agriculture made</seg><seg type="columnLine">one engineer the equivalent of thirty laborers. So, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verting the condition of the city clerk in the days when</seg><seg type="columnLine">London was scarce inhabitable because of the coaly foul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of its air, the laborers now came hurrying by road</seg><seg type="columnLine">or air to the city and its life and delights at night to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave it again in the morning. The city had swallowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up humanity; man had entered upon a new stage in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">development. First had come the nomad, the hunter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then had followed the agriculturist of the agricultural</seg><seg type="columnLine">state, whose towns and cities and ports were but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headquarters and markets of the countryside. And noW,</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical consequence of an epoch of invention, was this</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge new aggregation of men. Save London, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only four other cities in Britain--Edinburgh, Ports-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, Manchester and Shrewsbury. Such things as</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, simple statements of fact though they were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemporary men, strained Graham's imagination to</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture. And when he glanced ''over beyond there" at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange things that existed on the Continent, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed him altogether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He had a vision of city beyond city, cities on great</seg><seg type="columnLine">plains, cities beside great rivers, vast cities along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea margin, cities girdled by snowy mountains. Over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great part of the earth the English tongue was spoken;</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken together with its Spanish American and Hindoo</seg><seg type="columnLine">92</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and Negro and "Pidgin" dialects, it was the everyday</seg><seg type="columnLine">language of two-thirds of the people of the earth. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Continent, save as remote and curious survivals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three other languages alone held sway--German, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached to Antioch and Genoa and jostled Spanish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">English at Cadiz, a Gallicized Russian which met the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian English in Persia and Kurdistan and the "Pid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gin" English in Pekin, and French still clear and bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant, the language of lucidity, which shared the Medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terranean with the Indian English and German and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached through a negro dialect to the Congo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And everywhere now, through the city-set earth, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the administered "black belt" territories of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropics, the same cosmopolitan social organization pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vailed, and everywhere from Pole to Equator his prop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erty and his responsibilities extended. The whole world</seg><seg type="columnLine">was civilized; the whole world dwelt in cities; the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world was property. Over the British Empire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout America his ownership was scarcely dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guised, Congress and Parliament were usually regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">as antique, curious gatherings. And even in the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Empires of Russia and Germany, the influence of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth was conceivably of enormous weight. There, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, came problems--possibilities, but, uplifted as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, even Russia and Germany seemed sufficiently re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mote. And of the quality of the black belt administra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and of what that might mean for him he thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the fashion of his former days, not at all. That it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should hang like a threat over the spacious vision before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him could not enter his nineteenth century mind. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind turned at once from the scenery to the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a vanished dread. "What of the yellow peril?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked and Asano made him explain. The Chinese spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tre had vanished. Chinaman and European were at</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace. The twentieth century had discovered with re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luctant certainty that the average Chinaman was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized, more moral, and far more intelligent than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the average European serf, and had repeated on a gigan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic scale the fraternization of Scot and Englishman that</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened in the seventeenth century. As Asano put it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They thought it over. They found we were white men</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all." Graham turned again to the view and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts took a new direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the rim south-west, glittering and strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluptuous, and in some way terrible, shone those</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pleasure Cities, of which the kinematograph-phonograph</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the old man in the street had spoken. Strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">places reminiscent of the legendary Sybaris, cities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">art and beauty, mercenary art and mercenary beauty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sterile wonderful cities of motion and music, whither</seg><seg type="columnLine">repaired all who profited by the fierce, inglorious, eco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomic struggle that went on in the glaring labyrinth</seg><seg type="columnLine">below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fierce he knew it was. IIow fierce he could judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the fact that these latter-day people referred back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the England of the nineteenth century as the figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an idyllic easy-going life. He turned his eyes to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene immediately before him again, trying to conceive</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big factories of that intricate maze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Northward he knew were the potters, makers not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only of earthenware and china, but of the kindred pastes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and compounds a subtler mineralogical chemistry had</seg><seg type="columnLine">devised; there were the makers of statuettes and wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornaments and much intricate furniture; there too were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the factories where feverishly competitive authors de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vised their phonograph discourses and advertisements and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged the groupings and developments for their per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petually startling and novel kinematographic dramatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">works. Thence, too, flashed the world-wide messages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world-wide falsehoods of the news-tellers, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chargers of the telephonic machines that had replaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newspapers of the past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the westward beyond the smashed Council House</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were the voluminous offices of municipal control and gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment; and to the eastward, towards the port, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trading quarters, the huge public markets, the theatres,</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses of resort, betting palaces, miles of billiard</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloons, baseball and football circuses, wild beast rings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the innumerable temples of the Christian and quasi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christian sects, the Mahomedans, Buddhists, Gnostics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spook Worshippers, the Incubus Worshippers, the Furni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture Worshippers, and so forth; and to the south again a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast manufacture of textiles, pickles, wines and condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. And from point to point tore the countless mul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titudes along the roaring mechanical ways. A gigan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic hive, of which the winds were tireless servants, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ceaseless wind-vanes an appropriate crown and</seg><seg type="columnLine">symbol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE thought of the unprecedented population that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been sucked up by this sponge of halls and galleries</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the thirty-three million lives that were playing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">each its own brief ineffectual drama below him, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">complacency that the brightness of the day and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space and splendor of the view, and above all the sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own importance had begotten, dwindled and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished. Looking down from this height over the city it</seg><seg type="columnLine">became at last possible to conceive this overwhelming</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude of thirty-three millions, the reality of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsibility he would take upon himself, the vastness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the human Maelstrom over which his slender king-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship hung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to figure the individual life. It astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to realize how little the common man had changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of the visible change in his conditions. Life</seg><seg type="columnLine">and property, indeed, were secure from violence almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over the world, zymotic diseases, bacterial diseases</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all sorts had practically vanished, everyone had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiency of food and clothing, and warmed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city ways and sheltered from the weather--so much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost mechanical progress of science and the physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">organization of society had accomplished. But the crowd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was already beginning to discover, was a crowd still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless in the hands of demagogue and organizer, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividually cowardly, individually swayed by appetite, col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lectively incalculable. The memory of countless figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">in pale blue canvas came before his mind. Millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such men and women below him, he knew, had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been out of the city, had never seen beyond the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">round of unintelligent grudging participation in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's business, and unintelligent dissatisfied sharing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its tawdrier pleasures. He thought of the hopes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his vanished contemporaries, and for a moment the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream of London in Morris's quaint old News from No-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, and the perfect land of Hudson's beautiful Crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Age appeared before him in an atmosphere of infinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss. He thought of his own hopes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For in the latter days of that passionate life that lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">now so far behind him, the conception of a free and equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">manhood had become a very real thing to him. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped, as indeed his age had hoped, rashly taking it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">granted, that the sacrifice of the many to the few would</seg><seg type="columnLine">some day cease, thac a day was near when every child</seg><seg type="columnLine">born of woman should have a fair and assured chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of happiness. And here, after two hundred years, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same hope, still unfulfilled, cried passionately through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city. After two hundred years, he knew, greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever, grown with the city to gigantic proportions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were poverty and helpless labor and all the sorrows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already he knew something of the history of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervening years. He had heard now of the moral decay</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had followed the collapse of supernatural religion</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the minds of ignoble man, the decline of public honor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ascendency of wealth. For men who had lost their</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">belief in God had still kept their faith in property, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth ruled a venial world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His Japanese attendant, Asano, in expounding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">political history of the intervening two centuries, drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">an apt image from a seed eaten by insect parasites. First</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is the original seed, ripening vigorously enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then comes some insect and lays an egg under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin, and behold! in a little while the seed is a hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape with an active grub inside that has eaten out its</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance. And then comes some secondary parasite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some ichneumon fly, and lays an egg within this grub,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and behold! that, too, is a hollow shape, and the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">living thing is inside its predecessor's skin which itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">is snug within the seed coat. And the seed coat still</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeps its shape, most people think it a seed still, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all one knows it may still think itself a seed, vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous and alive. "Your Victorian kingdom," said Asano,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"was like that--kingship with the heart eaten out." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">landowners--the barons and gentry--began ages ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">with King John; there were lapses, but they beheaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">King Charles, and ended practically with King George,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mere husk of a king . . . the real power in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of their parliament. But the Parliament--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">organ of the land-holding tenant-ruling gentry--did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep its power long. The change had already come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nineteenth century. The franchises had been broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened until it included masses of ignorant men, "urban</seg><seg type="columnLine">myriads," who went in their featureless thousands to</seg><seg type="columnLine">vote together. And the natural consequence of a swarm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing constituency is the rule of the party organization.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Power was passing even in the Victorian time to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party machinery, secret, complex, and corrupt. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily power was in the hands of great men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">business who financed the machines. A time came when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the real power and interest of the Empire rested visibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two party councils, ruling by newspapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and electoral organizations--two small groups of rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">and able men, working at first in opposition, then pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a reaction of a genteel ineffectual sort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were numberless books in existence, Asano said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prove that--the publication of some of them was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">early as Graham's sleep--a whole literature of reaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact. The party of the reaction seems to have locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself into its study and rebelled with unflinching de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termination--on paper. The urgent necessity of either</seg><seg type="columnLine">capturing or depriving the party councils of power is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">common suggestion underlying all the thoughtful work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the early twentieth century, both in America and</seg><seg type="columnLine">England. In most of these things America was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier than England, though both countries drove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That counter-revolution never came. It could never</seg><seg type="columnLine">organize and keep pure. There was not enough of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old sentimentality, the old faith in righteousness, left</seg><seg type="columnLine">among men. Any organization that became big enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to influence the polls became complex enough to be un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dermined, broken up, or bought outright by capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich men. Socialistic and Popular, Reactionary and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Purity Parties were all at last mere Stock Exchange</seg><seg type="columnLine">counters, selling their principles to pay for their elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioneering. And the great concern of the rich was natur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally to keep property intact, the board clear for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game of trade. Just as the feudal concern had been to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the board clear for hunting and war. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world was exploited, a battlefield of businesses; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">financial convulsions, the scourge of currency manipula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, tariff wars, made more human misery during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twentieth century--because the wretchedness was dreary</seg><seg type="columnLine">life instead of speedy death--than had war, pestilence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and famine, in the darkest hours of earlier history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His own part in the development of this time he now</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew clearly enough. Through the successive phases</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the development of this mechanical civilization, aiding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently directing its development, there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown a new power, the Council, the board of his trustees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first it had been a mere chance union of the millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Isbister and Warming, a mere property holding com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany, the creation of two childless testators' whims, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the collective talent of its first constitution had speedily</seg><seg type="columnLine">guided it to a vast influence, until by title deed, loan</seg><seg type="columnLine">and share, under a hundred disguises and pseudonyms</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had ramified through the fabric of the American and</seg><seg type="columnLine">English States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wielding an enormous influence and patronage, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council had early assumed a political aspect; and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its development it had continually used its wealth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip the beam of political decisions and its political ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantages to grasp yet more and more wealth. At last</seg><seg type="columnLine">the party organizations of two hemispheres were in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands; it became an inner council of political control.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its last struggle was with the tacit alliance of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jewish families. But these families were linked only</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a feeble sentiment, at any time inheritance might</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling a huge fragment of their resources to a minor, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman or a fool, marriages and legacies alienated hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of thousands at one blow. The Council had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">such breach in its continuity. Steadily, steadfastly it</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE original Council was not simply twelve men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceptional ability; they fused, it was a council of</seg><seg type="columnLine">genius. It struck boldly for riches, for political influ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, and the two subserved each other. With amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">foresight it spent great sums of money on the art of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying, holding that invention back against an hour fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. It used the patent laws, and a thousand half-legal</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedients, to hamper all investigators who refused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work with it. In the old days it never missed a capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. It paid his price. Its policy in those days was</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorous--unerring, and against it as it grew steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and incessantly was only the chaotic selfish rule of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually rich. In a hundred years Graham had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost exclusive owner of Africa, of South America, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">France, of London, of England and all its influence--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all practical purposes, that is--a power in North</seg><seg type="columnLine">America--then the dominant power in America. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council bought an organized China, drilled Asia, crippled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Old World empires, undermined them financially,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought and defeated them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And this spreading usurpation of the world was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">dexterously performed--a proteus--hundreds of banks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">companies, syndicates, masked the Council's operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that it was already far advanced before common men</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected the tyranny that had come. The Council never</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated, never faltered. Means of communication, land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings, governments, municipalities, the territorial</seg><seg type="columnLine">companies of the tropics, every human enterprise, it gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered greedily. And it drilled and marshalled its men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its railway police, its roadway police, its house guards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drain and cable guards, its hosts of land-workers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their unions it did not fight, but it undermined and</seg><seg type="columnLine">betrayed and bought them. It bought the world at last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, finally, its culminating stroke was the introduction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the Council, in conflict with the workers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of its huge monopolies, did something flagrantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">illegal and that without even the ordinary civility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bribery, the old Law, alarmed for the profits of its com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaisance, looked about it for weapons. But there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more armies, no fighting navies; the age of Peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come. The only possible war ships were the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam vessels of the Council's Navigation Trust. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">police forces they controlled; the police of the railways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ships, cf their agricultural estates, their time-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keepers and order-keepers, outnumbered the neglected</seg><seg type="columnLine">little forces of the old country and municipal organiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions ten to one.

Was that song</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely the trick of a demagogue, to be forgotten when</seg><seg type="columnLine">its purpose was served? Was the hope that still stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">within him only the memory of abandoned things, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestige of a creed outworn? Or had it a wider mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, an import interwoven with the destiny of man?</seg><seg type="columnLine">To what end had he awakened, what was there for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do? Humanity was spread below him like a map.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought of the millions and millions of humanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">following each other unceasingly for ever out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness of non-existence into the darkness of death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">iTo what end? Aid there must be, but it transcended</seg><seg type="columnLine">his power of thought. He saw for the first time clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own infinite littleness, saw stark and terrible the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragic contrast of human strength and the craving of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human heart. For that little while he knew himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the petty accident he was, and knew therewith the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatness of his desire. And suddenly his littleness</seg><seg type="columnLine">was intolerable, his aspiration was intolerable, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him an irresistible impulse to pray. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayed. He prayed vague, incoherent, contradictory</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, his soul strained up through time and space and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the fleeting multitudinous confusion of being, to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards something--he scarcely knew what--towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that could comprehend his striving and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man and a woman were far below on a roof space</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the southward enjoying the freshness of the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing air. The man had brought out a perspective glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spy upon the Council House and he was showing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to use it. Presently their curiosity was satisfied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could see no traces of bloodshed from their position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after a survey of the empty sky she came round to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the crow's nest. And there she saw two little black</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures, so small it was hard to believe they were men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who watched and one who gesticulated with hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstretched to the silent emptiness of Heaven.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She handed the glass to the man. He looked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I believe it ij the Master. Yes. I a a sure. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Master!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lowered the glass and looked at her. "Waving</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands about almost as if he was praying. I wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he is up to. Worshipping the sun? There weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsees in this country in his time, were there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He looked again. ''He's stopped it now. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance attitude, I suppose." He put •'own the glas3</seg><seg type="columnLine">and became meditative. "He won't have anything to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do but enjoy himself--just enjoy himself. Ostrog will</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss the show of course. Ostrog will have to, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of keeping all these Laborer fools in bounds. Them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their song! And got it all by sleeping, dear eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">--'just sleeping. It's a wonderful world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XV</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prominent People</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE state apartments of the Wind Vane Keeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have seemed astonishingly intricate to Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham had he entered them fresh from his nineteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">century life, but already he was growing accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scale of the new time. They can scarcely be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed as halls and rooms, seeing that a complicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">system of arches, bridges, passages and galleries divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">and united every part of the great space. He came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through one of the now familiar sliding panels upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau or landing at the head of a flight of very broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gentle steps, with men and women far more bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liantly dressed than any he had hitherto seen ascending</seg><seg type="columnLine">and descending. From this position he looked down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vista of intricate ornament in lustreless white and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mauve and purple, spanned by bridges that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought of porcelain and filigree, and terminating far off</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a cloudy mystery of perforated screens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Glancing upward, he saw tier above tier of ascending</seg><seg type="columnLine">galleries with faces looking down upon him. The air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was full of the babble of innumerable voices of a music</seg><seg type="columnLine">that descended from above, a gay and exhilarating music</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose source he never discovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The central aisle was thick with people, but by no</seg><seg type="columnLine">means uncomfortably crowded; altogether that assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly must have numbered many thousands. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliantly, even fantastically dressed, the men as fanci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully as the women, for the sobering influence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Puritan conception of dignity upon masculine dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">had long since passed away. The hair of the men, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it was rarely worn long, was commonly curled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a manner that suggested the barber, and baldness</seg><seg type="columnLine">had vanished from the earth. Frizzy straight-cut masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would have charmed Rosetti abounded, and one gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tleman, who was pointed out to Graham under the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious title of an "amorist," wore his hair in two be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming plaits a la Marguerite. The pigtail was in evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence; it would seem that citizens of Chinese extraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no longer ashamed of their race. There was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniformity of fashion apparent in the forms of clothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn. The more shapely men displayed their symmetry</seg><seg type="columnLine">in trunk hose, and here were puffs and slashes, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cloak and there a robe. The fashions of the days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leo the Tenth were perhaps the prevailing influence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the aesthetic conceptions of the far east were also</seg><seg type="columnLine">patent. Masculine embonpoint, which, in Victorian</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, would have been subjected to the tightly buttoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">perils, the ruthless exaggeration of tight-legged tight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed evening dress, now formed but the basis of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth of dignity and drooping folds. Graceful slender-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness abounded also. To Graham, a typically stiff man</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from a typically stiff period, not only did these men</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem altogether too graceful in person, but altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">too expressive in their vividly expressive faces. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesticulated, they expressed surprise, interest, amuse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, above all, they expressed the emotions excited in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their minds by the ladies about them with astonishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">frankness. Even at the first glance it was evident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">women were in a great majority.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ladies in the company of these gentlemen dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">played in dress, bearing and manner alike, less emphasis</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more intricacy. Some affected a classical simplicity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of robing and subtlety of fold, after the fashion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">First French Empire, and flashed conquering arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders as Graham passed. Others had closely-fitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">dresses without seam or belt at the waist, sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with long fold falling from the shoulders. The delight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful confidences of evening dress had not been diminished</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the passage of two centuries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everyone's movements seemed graceful. Graham re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked to Lincoln that he saw men as Raphael's cartoons</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking, and Lincoln told him that the attainment of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">appropriate set of gestures was part of every rich per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's education. The Master's entry was greeted with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of tittering applause, but these people showed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguished manners by not crowding upon him nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">annoying him by any persistent scrutiny, as he descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps towards the floor of the aisle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had already learnt from Lincoln that these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaders of existing London society; almost every</seg><seg type="columnLine">person there that night was either a powerful official</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the immediate connection of a powerful official. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">had returned from the European Pleasure Cities ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressly to welcome him. The aeronautic authorities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose defection had played a part in the overthrow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Council only second to Graham's were very promi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent, and so, too, was the Wind Vane Control. Amongst</seg><seg type="columnLine">others there were several of the more prominent officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Food Trust; the controller of the European Pig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geries had a particularly melancholy and interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance and a daintily cynical manner. A bishop</seg><seg type="columnLine">in full canonicals passed athwart Graham's vision, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versing with a gentleman dressed exactly like the tradi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional Chaucer, including even the laurel wreath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is that?" he asked almost involuntarily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Bishop of London," said Lincoln.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--the other, I mean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poet Laureate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You still-?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He doesn't make poetry, of course. He's a cousin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Wotton--one of the Councillors. But he's one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Red Rose Royalists--a delightful club--and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep up the tradition of these things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Asano told me there was a King."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The King doesn't belong. They had to expel him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's the Stuart blood, I suppose; but really--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too much?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Far too much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham did not quite follow all this, but it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the general inversion of the new age. He bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">condescendingly to his first introduction. It was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that subtle distinctions of class prevailed even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this assembly, that only to a small proportion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests, to an inner group, did Lincoln consider it ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">propriate to introduce him. This first introduction was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Master Aeronaut a man whose sun-tanned face con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trasted oddly with the delicate complexions about him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just at present his critical defection from the Council</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him a very important person indeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ilis manner contrasted very favorably, according to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham's ideas, with the general bearing. He made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few commonplace remarks, assurances of loyalty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frank inquiries about the Master's health. His manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">was breezy, his accent lacked the easy staccato of latter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day English. He made it admirably clear to Graham</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was a bluff "aerial dog"--he used that phrase--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was no nonsense about him, that he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly manly fellow and old-fashioned at that, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't profess to know much, and that what he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know was not worth knowing. He made a manly</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow, ostentatiously free from obsequiousness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am glad to see that type endures," said Graham.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Phonographs and kinematographs," said Lincoln, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little spitefully. "He has studied from the life." Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at the burly form again. It was oddly</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminiscent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As a matter of fact we bought him," said Lincoln.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Partly. And partly he was afraid of Ostrog. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing rested with him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned sharply to introduce the Surveyor-Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral of the Public School Trust. This person was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">willowy figure in a blue-grey academic gown, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">beamed down upon Graham through pince-nez of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Victorian pattern, and illustrated his remarks by ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of a beautifully manicured hand. Graham was</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately interested in this gentleman's functions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked him a number of singularly direct questions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Surveyor-General seemed quietly amused at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master's fundamental bluntness. He was a little vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to the monopoly of education his Company possessed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was done by contract with the syndicate that ran the</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous London Municipalities, but he waxed en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiastic over educational progress since the Victorian</seg><seg type="columnLine">times. "We have conquered Cram," he said, "completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquered Cram--there is not an examination left in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. Aren't you glad?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you get the work done?" asked Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We make it attractive--as attractive as possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if it does not attract then--we let it go. We cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">an immense field."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE proceeded to details, and they had a lengthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation. The Surveyor-General mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the names of Pestalozzi and Froebel with profound re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spect, although he displayed no intimacy with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">epoch-making words. Graham learnt that University</seg><seg type="columnLine">Extension still existed in a modified form. "There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain type of girl, for example," said the Surveyor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">General, dilating with a sense of his usefulness, "with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a perfect passion for severe studies--when they are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">too difficult you know. We cater to them by the thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. At this moment," he said with a Napoleonic</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch, "nearly five hundred phonographs are lecturing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in different parts of London on the influence exercised</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Plato and Swift on the love affairs of Shelley, Haz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">litt, and Burns. And afterwards they write essays on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lectures, and the names in order of merit are put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in conspicuous places. You see how your little germ</seg><seg type="columnLine">has grown? The illiterate middle-class of your days</seg><seg type="columnLine">has quite passed away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About the public elementary schools," said Graham.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do you control them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Surveyor-General did, "entirely." Now Graham,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his later democratic days, had taken a keen interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in these and his questioning quickened. Certain casual</seg><seg type="columnLine">phrases that had fallen from the old man with whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had talked in the darkness recurred to him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surveyor-General, in effect, endorsed the old man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. "We have abolished Cram," he said, a phrase</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham was beginning to interpret as the abolition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sustained work. The Surveyor-General became senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental. "We try and make the elementary schools very</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant for the little children. They will have to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">so soon. Just a few simple principles--obedience--in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dustry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You teach them very little?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should we? It only leads to trouble and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">content. We amuse them. Even as it is--there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">troubles--agitations. Where the laborers get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas, one cannot tell. They tell one another. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are socialistic dreams--anarchy even! Agitators will</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to work among them. I take it--I have always</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken it--that my foremost duty is to fight against pop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular discontent. Why should people be made unhappy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"1 wonder," said Graham thoughtfully. ''But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a great many things I want to know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lincoln, who had stood watching Graham's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the conversation, intervened. ''There are</seg><seg type="columnLine">others," he said in an undertone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Surveyor-General of schools gesticulated him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self away. "Perhaps," said Lincoln, intercepting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">casual glance, "you would like to know some of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladies?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The daughter of the Manager of the Piggeries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the European Food Trust was a particularly charming</seg><seg type="columnLine">little person with red hair and animated blue eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln left him awhile to converse with her, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">displayed herself as quite an enthusiast for the "dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">old times," as she called them, that had seen the begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning of his trance. As she talked she smiled, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes smiled in a manner that demanded reciprocity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I have tried," she said, "countless times--to imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">those old romantic days. And to you--they are memo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ries. How strange and crowded the world must seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you! I have seen photographs and pictures of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old times, the little isolated houses built of bricks made</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of burnt mud and all black with soot from your fires,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railway bridges, the simple advertisements, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemn savage Puritanical men in strange black coats</seg><seg type="columnLine">and those tall hats of theirs, iron railway trains on</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron bridges overhead, horses and cattle, and even dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">running half wild about the streets. And suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have come into this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Into this," said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Out of your life--out of all that was familiar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The old life was not a happy one," said Graham. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not regret that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at him quickly. There was a brief pause.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She sighed encouragingly. "No?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Graham. "It was a little life--and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning. But this-. We thought the world com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plex and crowded and civilised enough. Yet I see--</seg><seg type="columnLine">although in this world I am barely four days old--</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking back on my own time, that it was a queer, bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">baric time--the mere beginning of this new order. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere beginning of this new order. You will find it</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to understand how little I know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may ask me what you like," she said, smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then tell me who these people are. I'm still very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much in the dark about them. It's puzzling. Are there</seg><seg type="columnLine">any Generals?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men in hats and feathers?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course not. No. I suppose they are the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who control the great public businesses. Who is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguished looking man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That? He's a most important officer. That is Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den. He is managing director of the Antibilious Pill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Company. I have heard that his workers sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">urn out a myriad myriad pills a day in twenty-four hours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fancy a myriad myriad!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A myriad myriad. No wonder he looks proud," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham. "Pills! What a wonderful time it is! That</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in purple?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is not quite one of the inner circle, you know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we like him. He is really clever and very amus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He is one of the heads of the Medical Faculty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our London University. All medical men, you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are shareholders in the Medical Faculty Company, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wear that purple. You have to be--to be qualified. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, people who are paid by fees for doing some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--" She smiled away the social pretensions of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">such people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are any of your great artists or authors here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No authors. They are mostly such queer people--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so preoccupied about themselves. And they quarrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">so dreadfully! They will fight, some of them, for prece-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence on staircases! Dreadful, isn't it? But I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wraysbury, the fashionable capillotomist, is here. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capri."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Capillotomist," said Graham. "Ah! I remember. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">artist! Why not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have to cultivate him," she said apologetically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Our heads are in his hands." She smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham hesitated at the invited compliment, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance was expressive. "Have the arts grown with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of civilised things?" he said. "Who are your great</seg><seg type="columnLine">painters?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at him doubtfully. Then laughed. "For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment," she said, "I thought you meant--" She laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. "You mean, of course, those good men you used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think so much of because they could cover great spaces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of canvas with oil-colours? Great oblongs. And people</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to put the things in gilt frames and hang them up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in rows in their square rooms. We haven't any. People</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew tired of that sort of thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what did you think I meant?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She put a finger significantly on a cheek whose glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was above suspicion, and smiled and looked very arch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pretty and inviting. "And here," and she indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyelid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GRAHAM had an adventurous moment. Then a gro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tesque memory of a picture he had somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen of Uncle Toby and the Widow flashed across his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. An archaic shame came upon him. He became</seg><seg type="columnLine">acutely aware that he was visible to a great number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested people. "I see," he remarked inadequately.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned awkwardly away from her fascinating facility.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked about him to meet a number of eyes that im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately occupied themselves with other things. Pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly he coloured a little. "Who is that talking with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady in saffron?" he asked, avoiding her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The person in question he learnt was one of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">organisers of the American theatres just fresh from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic production at Mexico. His face reminded Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham of a bust of Caligula. Another striking looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was the Black Labour Master. The phrase at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time made no deep impression, but afterwards it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred;--the Black Labour Master? The little lady, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no degree embarrassed, pointed out to him a charming</seg><seg type="columnLine">little woman as one of the subsidiary wives of the An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gelican Bishop of London. She added encomiums on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">episcopal courage--hitherto there had been a rule of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerical monogamy--"neither a natural nor an expedient</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition of things. Why should the natural develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the affections be dwarfed and restricted because</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man is a priest?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And, by the bye," she added, "are you an Anglican?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham was on the verge of hesitating inquiries about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the status of a "subsidiary wife," apparently an euphe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistic phrase, when Lincoln's return broke off this very</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestive and interesting conversation. They crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aisle to where a tall man in crimson, and two charm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing persons in Burmese costume (as it seemed to him)</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited him diffidently. From their civilities he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to other presentations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a little while his multitudinous impressions began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to organise themselves into a general effect. At first</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glitter of the gathering had raised all the democrat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Graham; he had felt hostile and satirical. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not in human nature to resist an atmosphere of cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teous regard. Soon the music, the light, the play of</seg><seg type="columnLine">colours, the shining arms and shoulders about him, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of hands, the transient interest of smiling faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the frothing sound of skilfully modulated voices, the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere of compliment, interest and respect, had woven</seg><seg type="columnLine">together into a fabric of indisputable pleasure. Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time forgot his spacious resolutions. He gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">way insensibly to the intoxication of the position that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was conceded him, his manner became less conscious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more convincingly regal, his feet walked assuredly, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black robe fell with a bolder fold and pride ennobled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice. After all this was a brilliant interesting world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His glance went approvingly over the shifting colours</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the people, it rested here and there in kindly criticism</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a face. Presently it occurred to him that he owed</seg><seg type="columnLine">some apology to the charming little person with the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair and blue eyes. He felt guilty of a clumsy snub.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not princely to ignore her advances, even if his</seg><seg type="columnLine">policy necessitated their rejection. He wondered if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should see her again. And suddenly a little thing touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the glamour of this brilliant gathering and changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">its quality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked up and saw passing across a bridge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">porcelain and looking down upon him, a face that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost immediately hidden, the face of the girl he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen overnight in the little room beyond the theatre</seg><seg type="columnLine">after his escape from the Council. And she was look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with much the same expression of curious expec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation, of uncertain intentness, upon his proceedings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the moment he did not remember when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen her, and then with recognition came a vague mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ory of the stirring emotions of their first encounter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the dancing web of melody about him kept the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that great marching song from his memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lady to whom he was talking repeated her remark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Graham recalled himself to the quasi-regal flirtation</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon which he was engaged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But from that moment a vague restlessness, a feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that grew to dissatisfaction, came into his mind. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was troubled as if by some half forgotten duty, by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of things important slipping from him amidst this</seg><seg type="columnLine">light and brilliance. The attraction that these bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladies who crowded about him were beginning to exer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cise ceased. He no longer made vague and clumsy re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponses to the subtly amorous advances that he was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured were being made to him, and his eyes wandered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another sight of that face that had appealed so</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongly to his sense of beauty. But he did not see her</seg><seg type="columnLine">again until he was awaiting Lincoln's return to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">this assembly. In answer to his request Lincoln had</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised that an attempt should be made to fly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon, if the weather permitted. He had gone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make certain necessary arrangements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham was in one of the upper galleries in conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation with a bright-eyed lady on the subject of Eadha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mite--the subject was his choice and not hers. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had interrupted her warm assurances of personal de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">votion with a matter-of-fact inquiry. He found her, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had already found several other latter-day women</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night, less well informed than charming. Suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling against the eddying drift of nearer melody,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the song of the Revolt, the great song he had heard in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hall, hoarse and massive, came beating down to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced up startled, and perceived above him an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oeil de boeuf through which this song had come, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond, the upper courses of cable, the blue haze, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pendant fabric of the lights of the public ways. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the song break into a tumult of voices and cease.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now he perceived quite clearly the drone and tumult</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the moving platforms and a murmur of many people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a vague persuasion that he could not account for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of instinctive feeling that outside in the ways a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge crowd must be watching this place in which their</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master amused himself. He wondered what they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be thinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though the song had stopped so abruptly, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the special music of this gathering reasserted itself, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> motif of the marching song, once it had begun, lingered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bright-eyed lady was still struggling with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysteries of Eadhamite when he perceived the girl he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen in the theatre again. She was coming now</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the gallery towards him; he saw her first before</seg><seg type="columnLine">she saw him. She was dressed in a faintly luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">grey, her dark hair about her brows was like a cloud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as he saw her the cold light from the circular opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the ways fell upon her downcast face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lady in trouble about the Eadhamite saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change in his expression, and grasped her opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape. "Would you care to know that girl, Sire?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked boldly. "She is Helen Wotton--a niece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ostrog's. She knows a great many serious things. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one of the most serious persons alive. I am sure you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will like her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another moment Graham was talking to the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bright-eyed lady had fluttered away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I remember you quite well," said Graham. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in that little room. When all the people were sing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and beating time with their feet. Before I walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the Hall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her momentary embarrassment passed. She looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him, and her face was steady. "It was wonderful,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said, hesitated, and spoke with a sudden effort. "All</seg><seg type="columnLine">those people would have died for you, Sire. Countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">people did die for you that night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her face glowed. She glanced swiftly aside to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no other heard her words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lincoln appeared some way off along the gallery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making his way through the press towards them. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him and turned to Graham strangely eager, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift change to confidence and intimacy. "Sire," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said quickly, "I cannot tell you now and here. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">common people are very unhappy; they are oppressed--</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are misgoverned. Do not forget the people, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced death--death that you might live."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know nothing--" began Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I cannot tell you now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lincoln's face appeared close to them. He bowed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apology to the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You find the new world pleasant, Sire?" asked Lin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coln, with smiling deference, and indicating the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">and splendour of the gathering by one comprehensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture. "At any rate, you find it changed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Graham, "changed. And yet, after all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so greatly changed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait till you are in the air," said Lincoln. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind has fallen; even now an aeropile awaits you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl's attitude awaited dismissal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham glanced at her face, was on the verge of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">question, found a warning in her expression, bowed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and turned to accompany Lincoln.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Aeropile</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a while, as Graham went through the passages</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Wind-Vane offices with Lincoln, he was pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied. But, by an effort, he attended to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things which Lincoln was saying. Soon his preoccupa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion vanished. Lincoln was talking of flying. Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a strong desire to know more of this new human at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainment. He began to ply Lincoln with questions. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had followed the crude beginnings of aerial navigation</seg><seg type="columnLine">very keenly in his previous life; he was delighted to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the familiar names of Maxim and Pilcher, Langley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chanute, and, above all, of the aerial proto-martyr Lillien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thal, still honored by men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even during his previous life two lines of investiga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion had pointed clearly to two distinct types of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trivance as possible, and both of these had been realized.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the one hand was the great engine-driven aeroplane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a double row of horizontal floats with a big aerial screw</seg><seg type="columnLine">9S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The ttcropilc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> behind, and on the other the nimbler aeropile. The aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes flew safely only in a calm or moderate wind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden storms, occurrences that were now accurately</seg><seg type="columnLine">predictable, rendered them for all practical purposes</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless. They were built of enormous size--the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch of wing being six hundred feet or more, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of the fabric a thousand feet. They were for</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger traffic alone. The lightly swung car they car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried was from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length. It was hung in a peculiar manner in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">minimize the complex vibration that even a moderate</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind produced, and for the same reason the little seats</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the car--each passenger remained seated during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voyage--were slung with great freedom of movement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The starting of the mechanism was only possible from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gigantic car on the rail of a specially constructed stage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham had seen these vast stages, the flying stages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the crow's nest very well. Six huge blank areas</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were, with a giant "carrier" stage on each.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The choice of descent was equally circumscribed, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">accurately plane surface being needed for safe ground-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Apart from the destruction that would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused by the descent of this great expanse of sail and</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, and the impossibility of its rising again, the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion of an irregular surface, a tree-set hillside, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance, or an embankment, would be sufficient to pierce</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> or damage the framework, to smash the ribs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, and perhaps kill those aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first Graham felt disappointed with these cum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bersome contrivances, but he speedily grasped the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that smaller machines would have been unremunerative,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the simple reason that their carrying power would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">disproportionately diminished with diminished size. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, the huge size of these things enabled them--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a consideration of primary importance--to traverse</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air at enormous speeds, and so run no risks of unan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipated weather. The briefest journey performed, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">from London to Paris, took about three-quarters of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, but the velocity attained was not high; the leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">to New York occupied about two hours, and by timing</seg><seg type="columnLine">oneself carefully at the intermediate stations it was pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible in quiet weather to go around the world in a day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little aeropiles (as for no particular reason they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were distinctively called) were of an altogether different</seg><seg type="columnLine">type. Several of these were going to and fro in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. They were designed to carry only one or two per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons, and their manufacture and maintenance was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">costly as to render them the monopoly of the richer</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of people. Their sails, which were brilliantly col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ored, consisted only of two pairs of lateral air floats</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same plane, and of a screw behind. Their small</seg><seg type="columnLine">size rendered a descent in any open space neither difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nor disagreeable, and it was possible to attach pneumatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels or even the ordinary motors for terrestrial traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, and so carry them to a convenient starting place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They required a special sort of swift car to throw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air, but such a car was efficient in any open</seg><seg type="columnLine">place clear of high buildings or trees. Human aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nautics, Graham perceived, were evidently still a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">way behind the instinctive gift of the albatross or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly-catcher. One great influence that might have brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aeropile to a more rapid perfection had been with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">held; these inventions had never been used in warfare.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The last great international struggle had occurred before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usurpation of the Council.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Flying Stages of London were collected together</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an irregular crescent on the southern side of the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They formed three groups of two each and retained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the names of ancient suburban hills or villages. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were named in order, Roehampton, Wimbledon Park,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Streatham, Norwood, Blackheath, and Shooter's Hill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were uniform structures rising high above the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral roof surfaces. Each was about four thousand yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and a thousand broad, and constructed of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound of aluminum and iron that had replaced iron in</seg><seg type="columnLine">architecture. Their higher tiers formed an openwork of</seg><seg type="columnLine">girders through which lifts and staircases ascended.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The upper surface was a uniform expanse, with portions</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the starting carriers--that could be raised and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">then able to run on very slightly inclined rails to the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fabric. Save for any aeropiles or aeroplanes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in port these open surfaces were kept clear for</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrivals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the adjustment of the aeroplanes it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom for passengers to wait in the system of theatres,</seg><seg type="columnLine">restaurants, news-rooms, and places of pleasure and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulgence of various sorts that interwove with the pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perous shops below. This portion of London was in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequence commonly the gayest of all its districts with</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of the meretricious gaiety of a seaport or city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hotels. And for those who took a more serious view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of aeronautics, the religious quarters had flung out an</seg><seg type="columnLine">attractive colony of devotional chapels, while a host of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant medical establishments competed to supply phys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical preparatives for the journey. At various levels</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the mass of chambers and passages beneath these,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran, in addition to the main moving ways of the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">which laced and gathered here, a complex system of</seg><seg type="columnLine">special passages and lifts and slides, for the convenient</seg><seg type="columnLine">interchange of people and luggage between stage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage. And a distinctive feature of the architecture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this section was the ostentatious massiveness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal piers and girders that everywhere broke the vistas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spanned the halls and passages, crowding and twin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up to meet the weight of the stages and the weighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">impact of the aeroplanes overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham went to the flying stages by the public ways.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was accompanied by Asano, his Japanese attendant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln was called away by Ostrog, who was busy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his administrative concerns. A strong guard of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wind-Vane police awaited the Master outside the Wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vane offices, and they cleared a space for him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper moving platform. His passage to the flying stages</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unexpected, nevertheless a considerable crowd gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered and followed him to his destination. As he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, he could hear the people shouting his name, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw numberless men and women and children in blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">come swarming up the staircases in the central path,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesticulating and shouting. He could not hear what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted. He was struck again by the evident existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a vulgar dialect among the poor of the city. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last he descended, his guards were immediately sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by a dense excited crowd. Afterwards it oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred to him that some had attempted to reach him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with petitions. His guards cleared a passage for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with difficulty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE found an aeropile in charge of an aeronaut await-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him on the westward stage. Seen close this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism was no longer small. As it lay on its launch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing carrier upon the wide expanse of the flying stage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its aluminum body skeleton was as big as the hull of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-ton yacht. Its lateral supporting sails braced</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stayed with metal nerves almost like the nerves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bee's wing, and made of some sort of glassy artificial</seg><seg type="columnLine">membrane, cast their shadow over many hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">square yards. The chairs for the engineer and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger hung free to swing by a complex tackle, within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the protecting ribs of the frame and well abaft the middle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The passenger's chair was protected by a wind-guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and guarded about with metallic rods carrying air cush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions. It could, if desired, be completely closed in, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham was anxious for novel experiences, and desired</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it should be left open. The aeronaut sat behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass that sheltered his face. The passenger could secure</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself firmly in his seat, and this was almost unavoid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able on landing, or he could move along by means of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little rail and rod to a locker at the stem of the machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where his personal luggage, his wraps and restoratives</seg><seg type="columnLine">were placed, and which also with the seats, served as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">makeweight to the parts of the central engine that pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected to the propeller at the stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engine was very simple in appearance. Asano,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing out the parts of this apparatus to him, told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that, like the gas-engine of Victorian days, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the explosive type, burning a small drop of a sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance called "fomile" at each stroke. It consisted simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reservoir and piston about the long fluted crank of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the propeller shaft. So much Graham saw of the machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flying stage about him was empty save for Asano</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their suite of attendants. Directed by the aeronaut</seg><seg type="columnLine">he placed himself in his seat. He then drank a mixture</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing ergot--a dose, he learnt, invariably adminis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered to those about to fly, and designed to counteract</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possible effect of diminished air pressure upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">system. Having done so, he declared himself ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the journey. Asano took the empty glass from him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped through the bars of the hull, and stood below</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the stage and waved his hand. Suddenly he seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to glide along the stage to the right and vanish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engine was beating, the propeller spinning, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a second the stage and the buildings beyond were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gliding swiftly and horizontally past Graham's eye; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things seemed to tilt up abruptly. He gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little rods on either side of him instinctively. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt himself moving upward, heard the air whistle over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the wind screen. The propeller screw moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">round with powerful rhythmic impulses--one, two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three, pause; one, two, three--which the engineer con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled very delicately. The machine began a quivering</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration that continued throughout the flight, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof areas seemed running away to starboard very quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and growing rapidly smaller. He looked from the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engineer through the ribs of the machine. Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideways, there was nothing very startling in what he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a rapid funicular railway might have given the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensations. He recognised the Council House and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Highgate Ridge. And then he looked straight down</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment physical terror possessed him, a pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionate sense of insecurity. He held tight. For a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond or so he could not lift his eyes. Some hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet or more sheer below him was one of the big wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanes of south-west London, and beyond it the south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernmost flying stage crowded with little black dots. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">things seemed to be falling away from him. For a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond he had an impulse to pursue the earth. He set his</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth, he lifted his eyes by a muscular effort, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of panic passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He remained for a space with his teeth set hard, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes staring into the sky. Throb, throb, throb--beat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">100	AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">went the engine; throb, throb, throb,--beat. He gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bars tightly, glanced at the aeronaut, and saw a smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his sun-tanned face. He smiled in return--perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little artificially. "A little strange at first," he shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he recalled his dignity. But he dared not look</seg><seg type="columnLine">down again for some time. He stared over the aeronaut's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to where a rim of vague blue horizon crept up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. For a little while he could not banish the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of possible accidents from his mind. Throb, throb, throb</seg><seg type="columnLine">--beat; suppose some trivial screw went wrong in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">supporting engine! Suppose--! He made a grim effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dismiss all such suppositions. After a while they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least abandon the foreground of his thoughts. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">up he went steadily, higher and higher into the clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once the mental shock of moving unsupported through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air was over, his sensations ceased to be unpleasant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">became very speedily pleasurable. He had been warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">of air sickness. But he found the pulsating movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the aeropile as it drove up the faint south-west breeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very little in excess of the pitching of a boat head on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to broad rollers in a moderate gale, and he was constitu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionally a good sailor. And the keenness of the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarefied air into which they ascended produced a sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightness and exhilaration. He looked up and saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue sky above fretted with cirrus clouds. His eye came</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously down through the ribs and bars to a shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight of white birds that hung in the lower sky. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">space he watched these. Then going lower and less appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensively, he saw the slender figure of the Wind-Vane</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper's crow's nest shining golden in the sunlight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing smaller every moment. As his eye fell with</seg><seg type="columnLine">more confidence now, there came a blue line of hills, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then London, already to leeward, an intricate space of</seg><seg type="columnLine">roofing. Its near edge came sharp and clear and ban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished his last apprehensions in a shock of surprise. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boundary of London was like a wall, like a cliff, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep fall of three or four hundred feet, a frontage broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by terraces here and there, a complex decorative</seg><seg type="columnLine">facade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That gradual passage of town into country through</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extensive sponge of suburbs, which was so character-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istic a feature of the great cities of the nineteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">century, existed no longer. Nothing remained of it but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a waste of ruins here, variegated and dense with thickets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the heterogeneous growths that had once adorned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gardens of the belt, interspersed among levelled brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">patches of sown ground, and verdant stretches of winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">greens. The latter even spread among the vestiges of</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses. But for the most part the reefs and skerries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins, the wreckage of suburban villas, stood among</seg><seg type="columnLine">their streets and roads, queer islands amidst the levelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanses of green and brown, abandoned indeed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants years since, but too substantial, it seemed, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cleared out of the way of the wholesale horticultural</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms of the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vegetation of this waste undulated and frothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">amidst the countless cells of crumbling house walls, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke along the foot of the city wall in a surf of bramble</seg><seg type="columnLine">and holly and ivy and teazle and tall grasses. Here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there gaudy pleasure palaces towered amidst the puny</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains of Victorian times, and cable ways slanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from the city. That winter day they seemed de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted. Deserted, too, were the artificial gardens among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ruins. The city limits were indeed as sharply de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fined as in the ancient days when the gates were shut at</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightfall and the robber foeman prowled to the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. A huge semi-circular throat poured out a vigorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic upon the Eadhamite Bath Road. So the first pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect of the world beyond the city flashed on Graham, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwindled. And when at last he could look vertically</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward again, he saw below him the vegetable fields</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Thames valley--innumerable minute oblongs of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ruddy brown, intersected by shining threads, the sewage</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditches.	,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS exhilaration increased rapidly, became a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">intoxication. He found himself drawing deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaths of air, laughing aloud, desiring to shout. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time that desire became too strong for him, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The machine had now risen as high as was customary</seg><seg type="columnLine">with aeropiles, and they began to curve about towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south. Steering, Graham perceived, was effected by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening or closing of one or two thin strips of membrane</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one or other of the otherwise rigid wings, and by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement of the whole engine backward or forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">along its supports. The aeronaut set the engine gliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly forward along its rail and opened the valve of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leeward wing until the stem of the aeropile was hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zontal and pointing southward. And in that direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">they drove with a slight list to leeward, and with a slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternation of movement, first a short, sharp ascent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a long downward glide that was very swift and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasing. During these downward glides the propeller</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inactive altogether. These ascents gave Graham a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious sense of successful effort; the descents through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rarefied air were beyond all experience. He wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">never to leave the upper air again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time he was intent upon the minute details of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landscape that ran swiftly northward beneath him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its minute, clear detail pleased him exceedingly. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed by the ruin of the houses that had once dotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country, by the vast treeless expanse of country from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which all farms and villages had gone, save for crumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins. He had known the thing was so, but seeing it so</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an altogether different matter. He tried to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">out places he had known within the hollow basin of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world below, but at first he could distinguish no data that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Thames valley was left behind. Soon, however, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were driving over a sharp chalk hill that he recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Guildford Hog's Back, because of the familiar out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of the gorge at its eastward end, and because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins of the town that rose steeply on either lip of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorge. And from that he made out other points, Leith</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hill, the sandy wastes of Aldershot, and so forth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Downs escarpment was set with gigantic slow-moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-wheels. Save where the broad Eadhamite Ports-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth Road, thickly dotted with rushing shapes, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course of the old railway, the gorge of the Wey was</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked with thickets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole expanse of the Downs escarpment, so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the grey haze permitted him to see, was set with wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels to which the largest of the city was but a younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother. They stirred with a stately motion before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south-west wind. And here and there were patches dotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sheep of the British Food Trust, and here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there a mounted shepherd made a spot of black. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing under the stern of the aeropile came the Wealden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heights, the line of Hindhead, Pitch Hill, and Leith Hill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a second row of wind-wheels that seemed striving</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rob the downland whirlers of their share of breeze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The purple heather was speckled with yellow gorse, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the further side a drove of black oxen stampeded be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore a couple of mounted men. Swiftly these swept be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind, and dwindled and lost color, and became scarce mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing specks that were swallowed up in haze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when these had vanished in the distance Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a peewit wailing close at hand. He perceived he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now above the South Downs, and staring over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder saw the battlements of Portsmouth Landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stage towering over the ridge of Portsdown Hill. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">another moment there came into sight a spread of ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping like floating cities, the little white cliffs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Needles dwarfed and sunlit, and the grey and glittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of the narrow sea. They seemed to leap the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solent in a moment, and in a few seconds the Isle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">101</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wight was running past, and then beneath him spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wider and wider extent of sea, here purple with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of a cloud, here grey, here a burnished mirror,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and here a spread of cloudy greenish blue. The Isle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wight grew smaller and smaller. In a few more minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strip of grey haze detached itself from other strips</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were clouds, descended out of the sky and became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coastline--sunlit and pleasant--the coast of northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">France. It rose, it took color, became definite and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailed, and the counterpart of the Downland of England</seg><seg type="columnLine">was speeding by below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a little time, as it seemed, Paris came above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon, and hung there for a space, and sank out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight again as the aeroplane circled about to the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. But he perceived the Eiffel Tower still standing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beside it a huge dome surmounted by a pin-point</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colossus. And he perceived, too, though he did not un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand it at the time, a slanting drift of smoke. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeronaut said something about "trouble in the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways," that Graham did not heed at the time. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the minarets and towers and slender masses that</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamed skyward above the city wind-vanes, and knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in the matter of grace at least Paris still kept in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of her larger rival. And even as he looked a pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue shape ascended very swiftly from the city like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead leaf driving up before a gale. It curved round and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soared towards them growing rapidly larger and larger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The aeronaut was saying something. "What?" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham, loth to take his eyes from this. "Aeroplane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sire," bawled the aeronaut pointing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They rose and curved about northward as it drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer. Nearer it came and nearer, larger and larger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The throb, throb, throb--beat, of the aeropile's flight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had seemed so potent and swift, suddenly appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow by comparison with this tremendous rush. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">great the monster seemed, how swift and ready! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed quite closely beneath them, driving along silently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vast spread of wire-netting translucent wings, a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive. Graham had a momentary glimpse of the rows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of wrapped-up passengers, slung in their little</seg><seg type="columnLine">cradles behind wind-screens, of a white-clothed engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling against the gale along a ladder way, of spouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines beating together, of the whirling wind screw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of a wide waste of wing. He exulted in the sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in an instant the thing had passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It rose slightly and their own little wings swayed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush of its flight. It fell and grew smaller. Scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">had they moved, as it seemed, before it was again only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flat blue thing that dwindled in the sky. This was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeroplane that went to and fro between London and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris. In fair weather and in peaceful times it came and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went four times a day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They beat across the Channel, slowly as it seemed now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Graham's enlarged ideas, and Beachy Head rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">greyly to the left of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Land," called the aeronaut, his voice small against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistling of the air over the wind-screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet," bawled Graham, laughing. "Not land yet. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to learn more of this machine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I meant--" said the aeronaut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to learn more of this machine," repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm coming to you," he said, and had flung himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">free of his chair and taken a step along the guarded rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them. He stopped for a moment, and his color</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed and his hands tightened. Another step and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clinging close to the aeronaut. He felt a weight on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder, the pressure of the air. His hat was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling speck behind. The wind came in gusts over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-screen and blew his hair in streamers past his cheek.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The aeronaut made some hasty adjustments for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting of the centres of gravity and pressure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to have these things explained," said Graham.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What do you do when you move that engine forward?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The aeronaut hesitated. Then he answered, "They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">complex, Sire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't mind," shouted Graham. "I don't mind."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a moment's pause. "Aeronautics is the se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cret--the privilege--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know. But I'm the Master, and I mean to know."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He laughed, full of this novel realization of power that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his gift from the upper air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The aeropile curved about, and the keen fresh wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut across Graham's face and his garment lugged at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body as the stem pointed round to the west. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men looked into each other's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sire, there are rules--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not where I am concerned," said Graham. "You seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forget."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The aeronaut scrutinized his face. "No," he said. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not forget, Sire. But in all the earth--no man who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a sworn aeronaut--has ever a chance. They come as</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have heard something of the sort.

"That's not</seg><seg type="columnLine">my game. I want to do it myself. Do it myself if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">smash for it! No! I will. See. I am going to clamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this--to come and share your seat. Steady! I mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fly of my own accord if I smash at the end of it. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have something to pay for my sleep. Of all other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things--. In my past it was my dream to fly.

Perhaps he chose it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be. He swore. He swung himself round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervening mass of levers and the aeropile swayed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Am I Master of the earth?" he said. "Or is your</seg><seg type="columnLine">Society? No. Take your hands off those levers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold my wrists. Yes--so. And now, how do we turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">her nose down to the glide?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sire," said the aeronaut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will protect me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord! Yes! If I have to burn London. Now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with that promise Graham bought his first lesson</seg><seg type="columnLine">in aerial navigation. "It's clearly to your advantage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this journey," he said with a loud laugh--for the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like strong wine--"to teach me quickly and well. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">I pull this? Ah! So! Hullo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back, Sire! Back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Back--right. One--two--three--good God! Ah!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up she goes! But this is living!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now the machine began to dance the strangest</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures in the air. Now it would sweep round a spiral of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely a hundred yards in diameter, now it would rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">up into the air and swoop down again, steeply, swiftly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling like a hawk, to recover in a rushing loop that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept it high again. In one of these descents it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving straight at the drifting park of balloons in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southeast, and only curved about and cleared them by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden recovery of dexterity. The extraordinary swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and smoothness of the motion, the extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of the rarefied air upon his constitution, threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham into a careless fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at last a queer incident came to sober him, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">send him flying down once more to the crowded life</seg><seg type="columnLine">below with all its dark insoluble riddles. As he swooped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a tap and something flying past, and a drop like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop of rain. Then as he went on down he saw some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like a white rag whirling down in his wake. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that?" he asked. "I did not see."</seg><seg type="columnLine">102</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The aeronaut glanced, and then clutched at the lever</seg><seg type="columnLine">to recover, for they were sweeping down.

He heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise coming up to meet him, a noise like the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves upon a pebbly beach, and saw that the roofs about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying stage were dark with his people rejoicing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his safe return. A dark mass was crushed together</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the stage, a darkness stippled with innumerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces, and quivering with the minute oscillation of waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">white handkerchiefs and waving hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Three Days</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LINCOLN awaited Graham in an apartment beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying stages. He seemed curious to learn all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had happened, pleased to hear of the extraor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary delight and interest which Graham took in flying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham was in a mood of enthusiasm. "I must learn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly," he cried. "I must master that. I pity all poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">souls who have died without this opportunity. The sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift air! It is the most wonderful experience in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will find our new times full of wonderful expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riences," said Lincoln. "I do not know what you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">care to do now. We have music that may seem novel."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For the present," said Graham, "flying holds me. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me learn more of that. Your aeronaut was saying there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is some trades union objection to one's learning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is, I believe," said Lincoln. "But for you--!</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you would like to occupy yourself with that, we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make you a sworn aeronaut tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham expressed his wishes vividly and talked of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensations for a while. "And as for affairs," he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly. "How are things going on?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lincoln waved affairs aside. "Ostrog will tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tomorrow," he said. "Everything is settling down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Revolution accomplishes itself all over the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Friction is inevitable here and there, of course; but your</seg><seg type="columnLine">rule is assured. You may rest secure with things in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ostrog's hands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Would it be possible for me to be made a sworn</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeronaut, as you call it, forthwith--before I sleep?" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham, pacing. "Then I could be at it the very first</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing tomorrow again. ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would be possible," said Lincoln thoughtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Quite possible. Indeed, it shall be done." He laughed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I came prepared to suggest amusements, but you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found one for yourself. I will telephone to the aeronauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal offices from here and we will return to your apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments in the Wind-Vane Control. By the time you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">dined the aeronauts will be able to come. You don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that after you have dined, you might prefer--?" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have prepared a show of dancers--they have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought from the Capri theatre."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hate ballets," said Graham shortly. "Always did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That other--. That's not what I want to see. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancers in the old days. For the matter of that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had them in ancient Egypt. But flying--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True," said Lincoln. "Though our dancers--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They can afford to wait," said Graham; "they can</seg><seg type="columnLine">afford to wait. I know. I'm not a Latin. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions I want to ask some expert--about your machin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery. I'm keen. I want no distractions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have the world to choose from," said Lincoln,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"whatever you want is yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Asano appeared, and under the escort of a strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard they returned through the city streets to Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham's apartments. Far larger crowds had assembled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness his return than his departure had gathered, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shouts and cheering of these masses of people some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times drowned Lincoln's answers to the endless questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham's aerial journey had suggested. At first Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">had acknowledged the cheering and cries of the crowd by</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows and gestures, but Lincoln warned him that such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognition would be considered incorrect behavior. Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham, already a little wearied by rhythmic civilities, ig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nored his subjects for the remainder of his public prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Directly they arrived at his apartments Asano de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted in search of kinematographic renderings of mach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inery in motion, and Lincoln despatched Graham's com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mands for models of machines and small machines to il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lustrate the various mechanical advances of the last two</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries. The little group of appliances for telegraphic</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication attracted the Master so strongly that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">delightfully prepared dinner, served by a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">charmingly dexterous girls, waited for a space. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit of smoking had almost ceased from the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, but when he expressed a wish for that indulgence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiries were made and some excellent cigars were dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered in Florida, and sent to him by pneumatic des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch while the dinner was still in progress. After-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards came the aeronauts, and a feast of ingenious won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders in the hands of a latter-day engineer. For the time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any rate, the neat dexterity of counting and number-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing machines, building machines, spinning engines, patent</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorways, explosive motors, grain and water elevators,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughter-house machines and harvesting appliances, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more fascinating to Graham than any bayadere. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were savages," was his refrain, "we were savages. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the stone age--compared with this.... And what</seg><seg type="columnLine">else have you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came also practical psychologists with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">very interesting developments in the art of hypnotism.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The names of Milne Bramwell, Fechner, Liebault, William</seg><seg type="columnLine">James, Myers and Gurney, he found, bore a value now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would have astonished their contemporaries. Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral practical applications of psychology were now in gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral use; it had largely superseded drugs, antiseptics and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anaesthetics in medicine; was employed by almost all who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had any need of mental concentration. A real enlarge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of human faculty seemed to have been effected in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this direction. The feats of "calculating boys," the won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, as Graham had been wont to regard them, of mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merizes, were now within the range of anyone who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could afford the services of a skilled hypnotist. Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago the old examination methods in education had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed by these expedients. Instead of years of study,</seg><seg type="columnLine">candidates had substituted a few -?eeks of trances, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the trances expert coaches had simply to repeat</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the points necessary for adequate answering, adding</seg><seg type="columnLine">a suggestion of the post hypnotic recollection of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">points. In process mathematics particularly, this Sid had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been of singular service, and it was now invariably in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voked by such players of chess and games of manual</seg><seg type="columnLine">dexterity as were still to be found. In fact, all operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">conducted under finite rules, of a quasi-mechanical sort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is, were now systematically relieved from the wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derings of imagination and emotion, and brought to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexampled pitch of accuracy. Little children of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboring classes, so soon as they were of sufficient age</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be hypnotized, were thus converted into beautifully</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">punctual and trustworthy machine minders, and released</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthwith from the long, long thoughts of youth. Aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nautical pupils, who gave way to giddiness, could be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved from their imaginary terrors. In every street</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hypnotists ready to print permanent memories upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mind. If anyone desired to remember a name, a series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of numbers, a song or a speech, it^ could be done by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">method, and conversely memories could be effaced, habits</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed, and desires eradicated--a sort of psychic sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gery was, in fact, in general use. Indignities, humbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiences, were thus forgotten, amorous widows would</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliterate their previous husbands, angry lovers release</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves from their slavery. To graft desires, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, was still impossible, and the facts of thought trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference were yet unsystematized. The psychologists il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lustrated their expositions with some astounding experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments in mnemonics made through the agency of a troupe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pale-faced children in blue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham, like most of the people of his former time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">distrusted the hypnotist, or he might then and there have</seg><seg type="columnLine">eased his mind of many painful preoccupations. But in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of Lincoln's assurances, he held to the old theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">that to be hypnotized was in some way the surrender of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his personality, the abdication of his will. At the ban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quet of wonderful experiences that were beginning, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted very keenly to remain absolutely himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next day, and another day, and yet another day</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed in such interests as these. Each day Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent many hours in the glorious entertainment of (lying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the third day he soared across middle France, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">within sight of the snow-clad Alps. These vigorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">exercises gave him restful sleep, and each day saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great stride in his health from the spiritless anaemia of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his first awakening. And whenever he was not in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, and awake, Lincoln was assiduous in the cause of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement; all that was novel and curious in contempo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rary invention was brought to him, until at last his</seg><seg type="columnLine">appetite for novelty was well-nigh glutted. One might</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill a dozen inconsecutive volumes with the strange things</seg><seg type="columnLine">they exhibited. Each afternoon he held his court for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour or so. He speedily found his interest in his contem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poraries becoming personal and intimate. At first he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been alert chiefly for unfamiliarity and peculiarity; any</seg><seg type="columnLine">floppishness in their dress, any discordance with his pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceptions of nobility in their status and manners had</seg><seg type="columnLine">jarred upon him, and it was remarkable to him how soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">that strangeness and the faint hostility that arose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, disappeared; how soon he came to appreciate the true</seg><seg type="columnLine">perspective of his position, and see the old Victorian days</seg><seg type="columnLine">remote and quaint. He found himself particularly amused</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the red-haired daughter of the Manager of the Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pean Piggeries. On the second day after dinner he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the acquaintance of a latter-day dancing girl, and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">her an astonishing artist. And after that, more hypnotic</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonders. On the third day Lincoln was moved to sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gest that the Master should repair to a Pleasure City,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this Graham declined, nor would he accept the services</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hypnotists in his aeronautical experiments. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">link of locality held him to London; he found a perpetual</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder in topographical identifications that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have missed abroad. "Here--or a hundred feet below</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," he could say, "I used to eat my midday cutlets</seg><seg type="columnLine">during my London University days. Underneath here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Waterloo and the perpetual hunt for confusing trains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Often have I stood waiting down there, bag in hand, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared up into the sky above the forest of signals, little</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking I should walk some day a hundred yards in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. And now in that very sky that was once a grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke canopy, I circle in an aeropile."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During those three days Graham was so occupied with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such distractions that the vast political movements in</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress outside his quarters had but a small share of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention. Those about him told him little. Daily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came Ostrog, the Boss, his Grand Visier, his mayor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palace, to report in vague terms the steady establish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of his rule; "a little trouble" soon to be settled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this city, "a slight disturbance" in that. The song of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">social revolt came to him no more; he never learned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been forbidden in the municipal limits; and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great emotions of the crow's nest slumbered in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But on the second and third of the three days he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, in spite of his interest in the daughter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pig Manager, or it may be by reason of the thoughts her</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation suggested, remembering the girl Helen Wot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, who had spoken to him so oddly at the Wind-Vane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keeper's gathering. The impression she had made was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep one, albeit the incessant surprise of novel circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances had kept him from brooding upon it for a space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now her memory was coming to its own. He won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered what she had meant by those broken half-forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentences; the picture of her eyes and the earnest passion'</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her face became more vivid as his mechanical inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ests faded. Her beauty came compellingly between him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and certain immediate temptations of ignoble passion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he did not see her again until three full days were</seg><seg type="columnLine">past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham Remembers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE came upon him at last in a little gallery that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran from the Wind-Vane Offices toward his state</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartments. The gallery was long and narrow, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a series of recesses, each with an arched fenestration that</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked upon a court of palms. He came upon her sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly in one of these recesses. She was seated. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned her head at the sound of his footsteps and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sight of him. Every touch of color vanished from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face. She rose instantly, made a step toward him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if to address him, and hesitated. He stopped and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, expectant. Then he perceived that a nervous tumult</seg><seg type="columnLine">silenced her, perceived, too, that she must have sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech with him to be waiting for him in this place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt a regal impulse to assist her. "I have wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see you," he said. "A few days ago you wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me something--you wanted to tell me of the people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was it you had to tell me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at him with troubled eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You said the people were unhappy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment she was silent still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It must have seemed strange to you," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It did. And yet--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was an impulse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at him with a face of hesitation.

His voice sank and ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not one man, but all men--give them only a leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak the desire of their hearts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head, and for a time there was silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked up suddenly, and their eyes met.

On previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasions he had passed over this ceremony as</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily as possible, in order to resume his aerial experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ences, but now he began to ask quick short questions. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very anxious to take up his empire forthwith. Ostrog</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought flattering reports of the development of affairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">abroad. In Paris and Berlin, Graham perceived that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was saying, there had been trouble, not organized re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance indeed, but insubordinate proceedings. "After</seg><seg type="columnLine">all these years," said Ostrog, when Graham pressed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiries; "the Commune has lifted its head again. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the real nature of the struggle, to be explicit." But</seg><seg type="columnLine">order had been restored in these cities. Graham, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more deliberately judicial for the stirring emotions he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt, asked if there had been any fighting. "A little,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Ostrog. "In one quarter only. But the Senegalese</seg><seg type="columnLine">division of our African agricultural police--the Consoli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dated African Companies have a very well drilled police</seg><seg type="columnLine">--was ready, and so were the aeroplanes. We expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little trouble in the continental cities, and in America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But things are very quiet in America. They are satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied with the overthrow of the Council. For the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should you expect trouble?" asked Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is a lot of discontent--social discontent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Labor Company?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are learning," said Ostrog with a touch of sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. "Yes. It is chiefly the discontent with the Labor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Company. It was that discontent supplied the motive</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of this overthrow--that and vour awakening."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ostrog smiled. He became explicit. "We had to stir</seg><seg type="columnLine">up their discontent, we had to revive the old ideals of</seg><seg type="columnLine">universal happiness--all men equal--all men happy--no</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxury that everyone may not share--ideas that have</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumbered for two hundred years. You know that? We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to revive these ideals, impossible as they are--in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to overthrow the Council. And now--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our revolution is accomplished, and the Council is</seg><seg type="columnLine">overthrown, and people whom we have stirred up--re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main surging.

"They are fine loyal</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutes, with no wash of ideas in their heads--such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">our rabble has. The Council should have had them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">police of the Ways, and things might have been different.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course, there is nothing to fear except rioting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreckage. You can manage your own wings now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can soar away to Capri if there is any smoke or fuss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have the pull of all the great things; the aeronauts</seg><seg type="columnLine">are privileged and rich, the closest trades union in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, and so are the engineers of the wind vanes.

"The day of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocracy is past," he said. "Past for ever. That day</seg><seg type="columnLine">began with the bowmen of Crecy, it ended when marching</seg><seg type="columnLine">infantry, when common men in masses ceased to win</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battles of the world, when costly cannon, great iron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clads, and strategic railways became the means of power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Today is the day of wealth. Wealth now is power as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">never was power before--it commands earth and sea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. All power is for those who can handle wealth. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">You must accept facts, and these are facts. The world</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Crowd! The Crowd as Ruler! Even in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">days that creed has been tried and condemned. Today</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has only one believer--a multiplex, silly one--the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Crowd."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham did not answer immediately. He stood lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sombre preoccupations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Ostrog. "The day of the common man is</seg><seg type="columnLine">past. On the open countryside one man is as good as</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, or nearly as good. The earlier aristocracy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a precarious tenure of strength and audacity. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tempered--tempered. There were insurrections,</seg><seg type="columnLine">duels, riots. The first real aristocracy, the first perma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent aristocracy, came in with castles and armor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished before the musket and bow. But this is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second aristocracy. The real one. Those days of gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder and democracy were only an eddy in the stream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The common man now is a helpless unit. In these days</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have this great machine of the city, and an organiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion complex beyond his understanding."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yet," said Graham, "there is something resists, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing you are holding down--something that stirs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presses."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will see," said Ostrog, with a forced smile that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would brush these difficult questions aside. "I have not</seg><seg type="columnLine">roused the force to destroy myself--trust me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder," said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ostrog stared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must the world go this way?" said Graham, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotions at the speaking point. "Must it indeed go in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way? Have all our hopes been vain?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?" said Ostrog. "Hopes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I came from a democratic age. And I find an aristo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cratic tyranny!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well,--but you are the chief tyrant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Ostrog, "take the general question. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the way that change has always travelled. Aristoc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">racy, the prevalence of the best--the suffering and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinction of the unfit, and so to better things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But aristocracy! those people I met--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh! not those!" said Ostrog. "But for the most part</seg><seg type="columnLine">they go to their death. Vice and pleasure! They have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no children. That sert of stuff will die out. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world keeps to one road, that is, if there is no turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. An easy road to excess, convenient Euthanasia for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pleasure seekers singed in the flame, that is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to improve the race!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Pleasant extinction," said Graham. "Yet--He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought for an instant. "There is that other thing--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Crowd, the great mass of poor men. Will that die</seg><seg type="columnLine">out? That will not die out. And it suffers, its suffering</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a force that even you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ostrog moved impatiently, and when he spoke, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke rather less evenly than before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you trouble about these things," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Everything will be settled in a few days now. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crowd is a huge foolish beast. What if it does not die</seg><seg type="columnLine">out? Even if it does not die, it can still be tamed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven. I have no sympathy with servile men. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard those people shouting and singing two nights ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were taught that song. If you had taken any man</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in cold blood and asked why he shouted, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have told you. They think they are shouting for you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they are loyal and devoted to you. Just then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ready to slaughter the Council. Today--they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">already murmuring against those who have overthrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Council."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no," said Graham. "They shouted because their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives were dreary, without joy or pride, and because in</seg><seg type="columnLine">me--in me--they hoped."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And what was their hope? What is their hope?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What right have they to hope? They work ill and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">want the reward of those who work well. The hope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind--what is it? That some day the Over-man</seg><seg type="columnLine">may come, that some day the inferior, the weak and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bestial may be subdued or eliminated. Subdued if</seg><seg type="columnLine">not eliminated. The world is no place for the bad. the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid, the enervated. Their duty--it's a fine duty tool--</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to die. The death of the failure! That is the path</seg><seg type="columnLine">by which the beast rose to manhood, by which man goe3</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to higher things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OSTROG took a pace, seemed to think, and turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham. "I can imagine how this great world state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ours seems to a Victorian Englishman. You regret</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the old forms of representative government--their</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectres still haunt the world, the voting councils and</seg><seg type="columnLine">parliaments and all that eighteenth century tomfoolery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You feel moved against our Pleasure Cities. I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought of that,--had I not been busy. But you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will learn better. The people are mad with envy--they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be in sympathy with you. Even in the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, they clamor to destroy the Pleasure Cities. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pleasure Cities are the excretory organs of the State,</seg><seg type="columnLine">attractive places that year after year draw together all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is weak and vicious, all that is lascivious and lazy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">108</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">all the easy roguery of the world, to a graceful destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. They go there, they have their time, they die child-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, all the pretty silly lascivious women die childless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mankind is the better. If the people were sane they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not envy the rich their way of death. And you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would emancipate the silly brainless workers that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have enslaved, and try to make their lives easy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant again. Just as they have sunk to what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are fit for." He smiled a smile that irritated Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">oddly. "You will learn better. I know those ideas; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my boyhood I read your Shelley and dreamt of Liberty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is no liberty, save wisdom and self-control. Lib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erty is within--not without. It is each man's own affair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suppose -- which is impossible -- that these swarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelping fools in blue get the upper hand of us, what then?</seg><seg type="columnLine">They will only fall to other masters. So long as there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are sheep Nature will insist on beasts of prey. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean but a few hundred years' delay. The coming of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aristocrat is fatal and assured. The end will be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Over-man--for all the mad protests of humanity. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">them revolt, let them win and kill me and my like. Others</seg><seg type="columnLine">will arise--other masters. The end will be the same."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder," said Graham doggedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he stood downcast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I must see these things for myself," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly assuming a tone of confident mastery. "Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">by seeing can I understand. I must learn. That is what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to tell you, Ostrog. I do not want to be King in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Pleasure City; that is not my pleasure. I have spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough time with aeronautics--and those other things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must learn how people live now, how the common life</seg><seg type="columnLine">has developed. Then I shall understand these things</seg><seg type="columnLine">better. I must learn how common people live--the labor</seg><seg type="columnLine">people more especially--how they work, marry, bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">children, die--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You get that from our realistic novelists," suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ostrog, suddenly preoccupied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want reality," said Graham, "not realism."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are difficulties," said Ostrog, and thought. "On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole perhaps--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did not expect--.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had thought--. And yet, perhaps--. You say you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to go through the Ways of the city and see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">common people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he came to some conclusion. "You would</seg><seg type="columnLine">need to go disguised," he said. "The city is intensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited, and the discovery of your presence among them</seg><seg type="columnLine">might create a fearful tumult. Still this wish of yours</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go into this city--this idea of yours--. Y'es, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think the thing over it seems to me not altogether--.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It can be contrived. If you would really find an interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that! You are, of course, Master. You can go soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you like. A disguise for this excursion Asano will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to manage. He would go with you. After all it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not a bad idea of yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will not want to consult me in any matter?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Graham suddenly, struck by an odd suspicion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, dear no! No! I think you may trust affairs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me for a time, at any rate," said Ostrog, smiling. "Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we differ--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham glanced at him sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no fighting likely to happen soon?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have been thinking about these negroes. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe the people intend any hostility to me, and, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, I am the Master. I do not want any negroes brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to London. It is an archaic prejudice perhaps, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have peculiar feelings about Europeans and the subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">races. Even about Paris--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ostrog stood watching him from under his drooping</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows. "I am not bringing negroes to London," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. "But if--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are not to bring armed negroes to London, what-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ever happens," said Graham. "In that matter I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite decided."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ostrog, after a pause, decided not to speak, and bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">deferentially.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In the City Ways</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND that night, unknown and unsuspected, Graham,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in the costume of an inferior wind-vane</seg><seg type="columnLine">official keeping holiday, and accompanied by Asano</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Labor Company canvas, surveyed the city through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had wandered when it was veiled in darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now he saw it lit and waking, a whirlpool of life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In spite of the surging and swaying of the forces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolution, in spite of the unusual discontent, the mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terings of the greater struggle of which the first revolt</seg><seg type="columnLine">was but the prelude, the myriad streams of commerce</seg><seg type="columnLine">still flowed wide and strong. He knew now something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dimensions and quality of the new age, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not prepared for the infinite surprise of the detailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">view, for the torrent of color and vivid impressions that</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured past him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This was his first real contact with the people of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter days. He realized that all that had gone before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saving his glimpses of the public theatres and markets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had its element of seclusion, had been a movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the comparatively narrow political quarter, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his previous experiences had revolved immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the question of his own position. But here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city at the busiest hours of night, the people to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large extent returned to their own immediate interests,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the resumption of the real informal life, the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits of the new time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They emerged at first into a street whose opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways were crowded with the blue canvas liveries. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarm Graham saw was a portion of a procession--</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was odd to see a procession parading the city seated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They carried banners of coarse red stuff with red let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters. "No disarmament," said the banners, for the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in crudely daubed letters and with variant spelling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and "Why should we disarm?" "No disarming." "No</seg><seg type="columnLine">disarming." Banner after banner went by, a stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">banners flowing past, and at last at the end, the song of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revolt and a noisy band of strange instruments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They all ought to be at work," said Asano. "They have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no food these two days, or they have stolen it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Asano made a detour to avoid the con-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested crowd that gaped upon the occasional passage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead bodies from hospital to a mortuary, the gleanings</seg><seg type="columnLine">after death's harvest of the first revolt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night few people were sleeping, everyone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">abroad. A vast excitement, perpetual crowds perpetu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally changing, surrounded Graham; his mind was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused and darkened by an incessant tumult, by the cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enigmatical fragments of the social struggle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as yet only beginning. Everywhere festoons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">banners of black and strange decorations, intensified the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality of his popularity. Everywhere he caught snatches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that crude thick dialect that served the illiterate class,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the class, that is, beyond the reach of phonograph culture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">111 their common-place intercourse. Everywhere this</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble of disarmament was in the air, with a quality</seg><seg type="columnLine">of immediate stress of which he had no inkling during</seg><seg type="columnLine">his seclusion in the Wind-Vane quarter. He perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">that as soon as he returned he must discuss this with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ostrog, this and the greater issues of which it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression, in a far more conclusive way than he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far done. Perpetually that night, even in the earlier</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours of their wanderings about the city, the spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unrest and revolt swamped his attention, to the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion of countless strange things he might otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">have observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This preoccupation made his impressions fragmentary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">109</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet amidst so much that was strange and vivid, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject, however personal and insistent, could exert un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided sway. There were spaces when the revolution-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ary movement passed clean out of his mind, was drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside like a curtain from before some startling new</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspect of the time. Helen had swayed his mind to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense earnestness of inquiry, but there came times</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she, even, receded beyond his conscious thoughts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At one moment, for example, he found they were travers-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the religious quarter, for the easy transit about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city afforded by the moving ways rendered sporadic</seg><seg type="columnLine">churches and chapels no longer necessary--and his at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention was vividly arrested by the facade of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christian sects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were traveling seated on one of the swift upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, the place leapt upon them at a bend and advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly towards them. It was covered with inscrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions from top to base, in vivid white and blue, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a vast and glaring kinematograph transparency</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented a realistic New Testament scene, and where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast festoon of black to show that the popular religion</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed the popular politics, hung across the lettering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham had already become familiar with the phono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">type writing and these inscriptions arrested him, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his sense for the most part almost incredible blas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phemy. Among the less offensive were: ''Salvation on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the First Floor and turn to the Right." "Put your</seg><seg type="columnLine">Money on your Maker." "The Sharpest Conversion in</seg><seg type="columnLine">London, Expert Operators! Look Slippy!" "What Christ</seg><seg type="columnLine">would say to the Sleeper;--Join the Up-to-date Saints!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Be a Christian--without hindrance to your present Oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupation." "All the Brightest Bishops on the Bench to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night and Prices as Usual." "Brisk Blessings for Busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Business Men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But this is appalling!" said Graham, as that deaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening scream of mercantile piety towered above them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What is appalling?" asked his little officer, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking vainly for anything unusual in this shrieking</seg><seg type="columnLine">enamel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This! Surely the essence of religion is reverence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh that!" Asano looked at Graham. "Does it shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" he said in the tone of one who makes a discovery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I suppose it would, of course. I had forgotten. Nowa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">days the competition for attention is so keen, and people</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply haven't the leisure to attend to their souls, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, as they used to do." He smiled. "In the old days</seg><seg type="columnLine">you had quiet Sabbaths and the countryside. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere I've read of Sunday afternoons that--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, that," said Graham glancing back at the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceding blue and white. "That is surely not the only--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are hundreds of different ways. But, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, if a sect doesn't tell it doesn't pay. Worship</seg><seg type="columnLine">has moved with the times. There are high class sects</seg><seg type="columnLine">with quieter ways--costly incense and personal attentions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all that. These people are extremely popular and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prosperous. They pay several dozen lions for those apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments to the Council--to you, I should say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Graham still felt a difficulty with the coinage, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mention of a dozen lions brought him abruptly to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter. In a moment the screaming temples and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarming touts were forgotten in this new interest. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn of a phrase suggested, and an answer confirmed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea that gold and silver were both demonetized, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamped gold wrhich had begun its reign amidst the mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chants of Phoenicia was at last dethroned. The change</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been graduated but swift, brought about by an exten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of the system of cheques that had even in his pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious life already practically superseded gold in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger business transactions. The common traffic of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, the common currency indeed of all the world, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">conducted by means of the little brown, green and pink</seg><seg type="columnLine">council cheques for small amounts, printed with a blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">payee. Asano had several with him, and at the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity he supplied the gaps in his set. They were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">printed not on tearable paper, but on a semi-transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">fabric of silken flexibility, interwoven with silk Acros3</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all sprawled a fac-simile of Graham's signature, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first encounter with the curves and turns of that famil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iar autograph for two hundred and three years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOME intermediary experiences made no impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently vivid to prevent the matter of the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armament claiming his thoughts again; a blurred picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a Theosophist temple that promised MIRACLES</seg><seg type="columnLine">in enormous letters of unsteady fire was least submerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, but then came the view of the dining hall in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northumberland Avenue. That interested him very</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the energy and thought of Asano he was able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">view this place from a little screened gallery reserved</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the attendants of the tables. The building was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaded by a distant muffled hooting, piping and bawling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which he did not at first understand the import, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">which recalled a certain mysterious leathery voice he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard after the resumption of the lights on the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his solitary wandering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had grown accustomed now to vastness and great</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers of people, nevertheless this spectacle held him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long time. It was as he watched the table service</seg><seg type="columnLine">more immediately beneath, and interspersed with many</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions and answers concerning details, that the reali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zation of the full significance of the feast of several</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand people came to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was his constant surprise to find that points that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one might have expected to strike vividly at the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">outset never occurred to him until some trivial detail</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly shaped as a riddle and pointed to the obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he had overlooked. In this matter, for instance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had not occurred to him that this continuity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, this exclusion of weather, these vast halls and ways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">involved the disappearance of the household; that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">typical Victorian "Home," the little brick cell containing</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen and scullery, living rooms and bedrooms, had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save for the ruins that diversified the countryside, van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished as surely as the wattle hut. But now he saw what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had indeed been manifest from the first, that London,</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded as a living place, was no longer an aggregation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of houses but a prodigious hotel, an hotel with a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand classes of accommodation, thousands of dining halls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chapels, theatres, markets and places of assembly, a syn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thesis of enterprises, of which he chiefly was the owner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">People had their sleeping rooms, with, it might be, ante-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chambers, rooms that were always sanitary at least what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever the degree of comfort and privacy, and for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest they lived much as many people had lived in the new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">made giant hotels of the Victorian days, eating, read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, thinking, playing, conversing, all in places of public</seg><seg type="columnLine">resort, going to their work in the industrial quarters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city or doing business in their offices in the trading</seg><seg type="columnLine">section.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He perceived at once how necessarily this state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs had developed from the Victorian city. The fun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">damental reason for the modern city had ever been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">economy of co-operation. The chief thing to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the merging of the separate households in his own gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eration was simply the still imperfect civilization of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, the strong barbaric pride, passions, and preju-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dices, the jealousies, rivalries, and violence of the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lower classes, which had necessitated the entire sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aration of contiguous households. But the change, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">taming of the people, had been in rapid progress even</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. In his brief thirty years of previous life he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen an enormous extension of the habit of consuming</seg><seg type="columnLine">meals from home, the casually patronized horse-box</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee-house had given place to the open and crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aerated Bread Shop for instance, women's clubs had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">their beginning, and an immense development of reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms, lounges and libraries had witnessed to the growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of social confidence. These promises had by this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">attained to their complete fulfilment. The locked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred household had passed away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These people below him belonged, he learnt, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower middle class, the class just above the blue laborers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a class so accustomed in the Victorian period to feed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every precaution of privacy that its members, when occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion confronted them with a public meal, would usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide their embarrassment under horseplay or a markedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">militant demeanor. But these gaily, if lightly dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">people below, albeit vivacious, hurried and uncommuni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cative, were dexterously mannered and certainly quite at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ease with regard to one another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He noted a slight significant thing; the table, as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he could see, was and remained delightfully neat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing to parallel the confusion, the broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast crumbs, the splashes of viand and condiment, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">overturned drink and displaced ornaments, which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have marked the stormy progress of the Victorian meal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The table furniture was very different. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornaments, no flowers, and the table was without a cloth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being made, he learnt, of a solid substance having the</seg><seg type="columnLine">texture and appearance of damask. He discerned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this damask substance was patterned with gracefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed trade advertisements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a sort of recess before each diner was a complex</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus of porcelain and metal. There was one plate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of white porcelain, and by means of taps for hot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold volatile fluids the diner washed this himself be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the courses; he also washed his elegant white metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife and fork and spoon as occasion required.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soup and the chemical wine that was the common drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">were delivered by similar taps, and the remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">covers traveled automatically in tastefully arranged dishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the table along silver rails. The diner stopped these</seg><seg type="columnLine">and helped himself at his discretion. They appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a little door at one end of the table, and vanished at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. That turn of democratic sentiment in decay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ugly pride of menial souls, which renders equals</seg><seg type="columnLine">loth to wait on one another, was very strong he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">among these people. He was so preoccupied with these</seg><seg type="columnLine">details that it was only just as he was leaving the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he remarked the huge advertisement dioramas that</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched majestically along the upper walls and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed the most remarkable commodities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond this place they came into a crowded hall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he discovered the cause of the noise that had per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexed him. They paused at a turnstile at which a pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham's attention was immediately arrested by a vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent, loud hoot, followed by a vast leathery voice. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master is sleeping peacefully," it vociferated. "He is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent health. He is going to devote the rest of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life to aeronautics. He says women are more beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever. Galloop! Wow! Our wonderful civilization</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishes him beyond measure. Beyond all measure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galloop. He puts great trust in Boss Ostrog, absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence in Boss Ostrog. Ostrog is to be his chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">minister; is authorized to remove or reinstate public</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers--all patronage will be in his hands. All patronage</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hands of Boss Ostrog! The Councillors have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent back to their own prison above the Council House."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham stopped at the first sentence, and, looking up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beheld a foolish trumpet face from which this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brayed. This was the General Intelligence Machine. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a space it seemed to be gathering breath, and a regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing from its cylindrical body was audible. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it trumpeted "Galloop, Galloop," and broke out again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Paris is now pacified. All resistance is over. Galloop!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The black police hold every position of importance in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. They fought with great bravery, singing songs</seg><seg type="columnLine">written in praise of their ancestors by the poet Kipling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once or twice they got out of hand, and tortured and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutilated wounded and captured insurgents, men and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">women. Moral--don't go rebelling. Haha! Galloop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galloop! They are lively fellows. Lively brave fellows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let this be a lesson to the disorderly banderlog of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. Yah! Banderlog! Filth of the earth! Galloop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galloop!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice ceased. There was a confused murmur of</seg><seg type="columnLine">disapproval among the crowd. "Damned niggers." A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man began to harangue near them. "Is this the Master's</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing, brothers? Is this the Master's doing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Black police!" said Graham. "What is that? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't mean--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Asano touched his arm and gave him a warning look,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forthwith another of these mechanisms screaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">deafeningly and gave tongue in a shrill voice. "Yahaha,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yahah, Yap! Hear a live paper yelp! Live paper. Yaha!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shocking outrage in Paris. Yahahah! The Parisians</seg><seg type="columnLine">exasperated by the black police to the pitch of assassina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Dreadful reprisals. Savage times come again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blood! Blood! Yaha!" The nearer Babble Machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooted stupendously, "Galloop, Galoop," drowned the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sentence, and proceeded in a rather flatter note</seg><seg type="columnLine">than before with novel comments on the horrors of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">order. "Law and order must be maintained," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer Babble Machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," began Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't ask questions here," said Asano, "or you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be involved in an argument."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then let us go on," said Graham, "for I want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know more of this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS he and his companion pushed their way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excited crowd that swarmed beneath these</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices, toward the exit, Graham conceived more clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proportion and features of this room. Altogether,</seg><seg type="columnLine">great and small, there must have been nearly a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand of these erections, piping, hooting, bawling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gabbling in that great space, each with its crowd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited listeners, the majority of them men dressed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue canvas. There were all sizes of machines, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little gossipping mechanisms that chuckled out mechani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal sarcasm in odd corners, through a number of grades</seg><seg type="columnLine">to such fifty-foot giants as that which had first hooted</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This place was unusually crowded, because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense public interest in the course of affairs in Paris.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently the struggle had been much more savage than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ostrog had represented it. All the mechanisms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">discoursing upon that topic, and the repetition of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people made the huge hive buzz with such phrases as</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lynched policemen," "Women burnt alive," "Fuzzv</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wuzzy." "But does the Master allow such things?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man'near him. "Is this the beginning of the Master's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rule?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Is this the beginning of the Master's rule? For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time after he had left the place, the hooting, whist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling and braying of the machines pursued him: "Galloop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galloop," "Yahahah, Yaha, Yap! Yaha!" Is this the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of the Master's rule?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Directly they were out upon the ways he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">question Asano closely on the nature of the Parisian</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle. "This disarmament! What was their trouble?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What does it all mean?" Asano seemed chiefly anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reassure him that it was "all right." "But these out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rages 1" "You cannot have an omelet," said Asano, "with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out breaking eggs. It is only the rough people. Only in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one part of the city. All the rest is all right The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parisian laborers are the wildest in the world, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">ours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What! the Londoners?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, the Japanese. They have to be kept in order."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But burning women alive!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A Commune!" said Asano. "They would rob you</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your property. They would do away with property</seg><seg type="columnLine">and give the world over to mob rule. You are Master,</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1111</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the world is yours.

Senegal regi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, and Niger and Timbuctoo."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Regiments?" said Graham, "I thought there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one--."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Asano, and glanced at him. "There is more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham felt unpleasantly helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did not think," he began and stopped abruptly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went off at a tangent to ask for information about these</seg><seg type="columnLine">Babble Machines. For the most part, the crowd present</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been shabbily or even raggedly dressed, and Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">learnt that so far as the more prosperous classes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned, in all the more comfortable private apartments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the city were fixed Babble Machines that would speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly a lever was pulled. The tenant of the apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">could connect this with the cables of any of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">News Syndicates that he preferred. When he learnt</seg><seg type="columnLine">this presently, he demanded the reason of their absence</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his own suite of apartments. Asano stared. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never thought," he said. "Ostrog must have had them</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham started. "How was I to know?" he exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps he thought they would annoy you," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They must be replaced directly I return," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham after an interval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found a difficulty in understanding that this news</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and the dining hall were not great central places,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that such establishments were repeated almost beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">counting all over the city. But ever and again during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night's expedition his ears, in some new quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">would pick out from the tumult of the ways the peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooting of the organ of Boss Ostrog, "Galloop. Galloop!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the shrill "Yahaha, Yaha, Yap!--Hear a live paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelp!" of its chief rival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Repeated, too, everywhere, were such creches as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one he now entered. It was reached by a lift, and by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass bridge that flung across the dining hall and trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ersed the ways at a slight upward angle. To enter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first section of the place necessitated the use of his solvent</seg><seg type="columnLine">signature under Asano's direction. They were immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately attended to by a man in a violet robe and gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasp, the insignia of practising medical men. He per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived from this man's manner that his identity was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, and proceeded to ask questions on the strange ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangements of the place without reserve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On either side of the passage, which was silent and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The general Intelligence tnachioc.</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">padded, as if to deaden the footfall, were narrow little</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors, their size and arrangement suggestive of the cells</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a Victorian prison. But the upper portion of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was of the same greenish transparent stuff that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosed him at his awakening, and within, dimly seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay, in every case, a very young baby in a little nest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wadding. Elaborate apparatus watched the atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rang a bell far away in the central office at the slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est departure from the optimum of temperature and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moisture. A system of such creches had almost entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced the hazardous adventures of the old-world nurs-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The attendant presently called Graham's attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wet nurses, a vista of mechanical figures, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, shoulders and breasts of astonishingly realistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">modeling, articulation, and texture, but mere brass tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pods below, and having in place of features a flat disc</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing advertisements likely to be of interest to mothers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of all the strange things that Graham came upon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, none jarred more upon his habits of thought than</seg><seg type="columnLine">this place. The spectacle of the little pink creatures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feeble limbs swaying uncertainly in vague first</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements, left alone, without embrace or endearment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wholly repugnant to him. The attendant doctor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a different opinion. His statistical evidence showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond dispute that in the Victorian times, the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous passage of life was the arms of the mother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there human mortality had ever been most terrible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the other hand this creche company, the International</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creche Syndicate, lost not one-half per cent of the million</seg><seg type="columnLine">babies or so that formed its peculiar care. But Graham's</seg><seg type="columnLine">prejudice was too strong even for those figures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Along one of the many passages of the place they</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently came upon a young couple in the usual blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas peering through the transparency and laughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysterically at the bald head of their first-born. Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham's face must have showed his estimate of them for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their merriment ceased and they looked abashed. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">this little incident accentuated his sudden realization of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gulf between his habits of thought and the ways of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new age. He passed on to the crawling rooms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kindergarten, perplexed and distressed. He found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the endless long playrooms were empty! the latter-day</seg><seg type="columnLine">children at least still spent their nights in sleep. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went through these, the little officer pointed out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of the toys, developments of those devised by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspired sentimentalist Froebel. There were nurses</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, but much was done by machines that sang and</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced and dangled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham was still not clear upon many points. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">so many orphans," he said perplexed, reverting to a first</seg><seg type="columnLine">misconception, and learnt again that they were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">orphans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So soon as thev had left the creche he began to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the horror the babies in their incubating cases had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused him. "Is motherhood gone?" he said. "Was it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cant? Surely it was an instinct. This seems so unnat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ural--abominable almost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Along here we shall come to the dancing place," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asano by way of reply. "It is sure to be crowded. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of all the political unrest it will be crowded. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">women take no great interest in politics--except a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there. You will see the mothers--most young</seg><seg type="columnLine">women in London are mothers. In that class it is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered a creditable thing to have one child--a proof of</seg><seg type="columnLine">animation. Few middle class people have more than one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the Labor Company it is different. As for mother-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood! They still take an immense pride in the children.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They come here to look at them quite often."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then do you mean that the population of the world</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_V*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is falling? Yes. Except among the people under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Labor Company.

"The</seg><seg type="columnLine">world has changed. In a moment you will see the mothers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the new age. Come this way. We shall see those</seg><seg type="columnLine">yonder again very soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They ascended a certain height in a swift lift, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed to a slower one. As they went on the music</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew upon them, until it was near and full and splen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">did, and, moving with its glorious intricacies they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguish the beat of innumerable dancing feet. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a payment at a turnstile, and emerged upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide gallery that overlooked the dancing place, and upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full enchantment of sound and sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here," said Asano, "are the fathers and mothers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little ones you saw."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hall was not so richly decorated as that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlas, but saving that, it was, for its size, the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid Graham had seen. The beautiful white-limbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures that supported the galleries reminded him once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the restored magnificence of sculpture; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to writhe in engaging attitudes, their faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. The source of the music that filled the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hidden, and the whole vast shining floor was thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">with dancing couples. "Look at them," said the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer, "see how much they show of motherhood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE gallery they stood upon ran along the upper edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a huge screen that cut the dancing hall on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side from a sort of outer hall that showed through broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">arches the incessant onward rush of the city ways. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">this outer hall was a great crowd of less brilliantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed people, as numerous almost as those who danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">within, the great majority wearing the blue uniform of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Labor Company that was now so familiar to Graham.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too poor to pass the turnstiles to the festival, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet unable to keep away from the sound of its seductions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of them even had cleared spaces, and were dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">also, fluttering their rags in the air. Some shouted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they danced, jests and odd allusions Graham did not un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand. Once someone began whistling the refrain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revolutionary song, but it seemed as though that</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning was promptly suppressed. The corner was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark and Graham could not see. He turned to the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Above the caryatid® were marble busts of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom that age esteemed great moral emancipators and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pioneers; for the most part their names were strange to</seg><seg type="columnLine">graham, though he recognized Grant Allen, Le Gallienne.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nietzsche, Shelley and Goodwin. Great black festoons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eloquent sentiments reinforced the huge inscription</seg><seg type="columnLine">that partially defaced the upper end of the dancing place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asserted that "The Festival of the Awakening" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Myriads are taking holiday or staying from work</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of that, quite apart from the laborers who</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuse to go back," said Asano. "These people are al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways ready for holidays."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham walked to the parapet and stood leaning over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking down at the dancers. Save for two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">remote whispering couples, who had stolen apart, he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his guide had the gallery to themselves. A warm breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scent and vitality came up to him. Both men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women below were lightly clad, bare-armed, open-necked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the universal warmth of the city permitted. The hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the men was often a mass of effeminate curls, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chins were always shaven, and many of them had flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">or colored cheeks. Many of the women were very pretty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all were dressed with elaborate coquetry. As they</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept by beneath, he saw ecstatic faces with eyes half</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed in pleasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What sort of people are these?" he asked abruptly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Workers--prosperous workers. What you would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the middle class. Independent tradesmen with</seg><seg type="columnLine">little separate businesses have vanished long ago, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are store servers, managers, engineers of a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorts. Tonight is a holiday of course, and every dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in the city will be crowded, and every place of</seg><seg type="columnLine">worship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But--the women?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The same. There's a thousand forms of work for</seg><seg type="columnLine">women now. But you had the beginning of the inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendent working-woman in your days. Most women are</seg><seg type="columnLine">independent now. Most of these are married more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less--there are a number of methods of contract--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gives them more money, and enables them to enjoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," said Graham looking at the flushed faces, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash and swirl of movement, and still thinking of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmare of pink helpless limbs. "And these are--</seg><seg type="columnLine">mothers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The more I see of these things the more complex I</seg><seg type="columnLine">find your problems. This, for instance, is a surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That news from Paris was a surprise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a little while he spoke again:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These are mothers. Presently, I suppose, I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">get into the modern way of seeing things. I have old</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits of mind clinging about me--habits based, I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose, on needs that are over and done with. Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our time, a woman was supposed not only to bear chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren, but to cherish them, to devote herself to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to educate them--all the essentials of moral and mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">education a child owed its mother. Or went without.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quite a number, I admit, went without. Nowadays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly, there is no more need for such care than if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were butterflies. I see that! Only there was an ideal--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that figure of a grave, patient woman, silently and serene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly mistress of a home, mother and maker of men--to love</seg><seg type="columnLine">her was a sort of worship--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped and repeated, "A sort of worship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ideals change," said the little man, "as needs change."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham awoke from an instant reverie and Asano re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated his words. Graham's mind returned to the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course I see the perfect reasonableness of this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Restraint, soberness, the matured thought, the unselfish</seg><seg type="columnLine">act, they are necessities of the barbarous state, the life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangers. Dourness is man's tribute to unconquered</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature. But man has conquered nature now for all prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical purposes--his political affairs are managed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bosses with a black police--and life is joyous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at the dancers again. "Joyous," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are weary moments," said the little officer re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flectively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They all look young. Down there I should be visibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oldest man. And in my own time I should have passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as middle-aged."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are young. There are few old people in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">class in the work cities."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How is that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Old people's lives are not so pleasant as they used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, unless they arc rich to hire lovers and helpers. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have an institution called Euthanasy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! that Euthanasy!" said Graham. "The easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">death?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The easy death. It is the last pleasure. The Eu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jhanasy Company does it well. People will pay the sum--</seg><seg type="columnLine">'t is a costly thing--long beforehand, go off to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure city and return impoverished and weary, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">weary."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is a lot left for me to understand," said Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a pause. "Yet I see the logic of it all. Our array</seg><seg type="columnLine">of angry virtues and sour restraints was the consequence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of danger and insecurity. The Stoic, the Puritan, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my time, were vanishing types. In the old days man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was armed against Pain, now he is eager for Pleasure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There lies the difference. Civilization has driven pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and danger so far off--for well-to-do people. And only</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-to-do people matter now. I have been asleep two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a minute they leant on the balustrading, follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the intricate evolution of the dance. Indeed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene was very beautiful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Before God," said Graham suddenly, "I would rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a wounded sentinel freezing in the snow than one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these painted fools!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the snow," said Asano, "one might think differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am uncivilized," said Graham, not heeding him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is the trouble. I am primitive--Paleolithic. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountain of rage and fear and anger is sealed and closed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the habits of a lifetime make them cheerful and easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and delightful. You must bear with my nineteenth cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tury shocks and disgusts. These people, you say, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">skilled workers and so forth. And while these dance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">men are fighting--men are dying in Paris to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world--that they may dance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Asano smiled faintly. "For that matter, men are dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">in London," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a moment's silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where do these sleep?" asked Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Above and below--an intricate warren."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And where do they work? This is--the domestic</seg><seg type="columnLine">life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will see little work tonight. Half the workers</seg><seg type="columnLine">are out or under arms. Half these people are keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">holiday. But we will go to the work places if you wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time Graham watched the dancers, then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly turned away. "I want to see the workers. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen enough of these," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASANO led the way along the gallery across the danc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hall. Presently they came to a transverse pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage that brought a breath of fresher, colder air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Asano glanced at this passage as they went past,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, went back to it, and turned to Graham with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. "Here, Sire," he said, "is something--will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar to you at least--and yet--. But I will not tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Come!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led the way along a closed passage that presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">became cold. The reverberation of their feet told that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this passage was a bridge. They came into a circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallery that was glazed in from the outer weather, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so reached a circular chamber which seemed familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">though Graham could not recall distinctly when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered it before. In this was a ladder--the first ladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen since his awakening--up which they went,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came into a high, dark, cold place in which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">another almost vertical ladder. This they ascended, Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham still perplexed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at the top he understood, and recognized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic bars to which he clung. He was in the cage</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the ball of St. Paul's. The dome rose but a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">way above the general contour of the city, into the still</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight, and sloped away, shining greasily under a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant lights, into a circumambient ditch of darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out between the bars he looked upon the wind-clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern sky and saw the starry constellations all un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. Capella hung in the west, Vega was rising, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seven glittering points of the Great Bear swept over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in their stately circle about the Pole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw these stars in a clear gap of sky. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">east and south the great circular shapes of complaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-wheels blotted out the heavens, so that the glare</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Council House was hidden. To the south-west</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung Orion, showing like a pallid ghost through a tracery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ironwork and interlacing shapes above a dazzling cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uscation of lights. A bellowing and siren screaming that</seg><seg type="columnLine">114</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the flying stages warned the world that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the aeroplanes was ready to start. He remained for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a space gazing toward the glaring stage. Then his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to the northward constellations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time he was silent. "This," he said at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling in the shadow, "seems the strangest thing of all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To stand in the dome of Saint Paul's and look once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon these familiar, silent stars!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thence Graham was taken by Asano along devious</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways to the great gambling and business quarters where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulk of the fortunes in the city were lost and made.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It impressed him as a well-nigh interminable series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">very high halls, surrounded by tiers upon tiers of gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leries into which opened thousands of offices, and tra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versed by a complicated multitude of bridges, footways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aerial motor rails, and trapeze and cable leaps. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">here more than anywhere the note of vehement vitality,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of uncontrollable, hasty activity, rose high. Everywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">was violent advertisement, until his brain swam at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumult of light and color. And Babble Machines of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarly rancid tone were abundant and filled the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">with strenuous squealing and an idiotic slang. "Skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">your eyes and slide," "Gewhoop, Bonanza," "Gollipers</seg><seg type="columnLine">come and hark!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The place seemed to him to be dense with people either</seg><seg type="columnLine">profoundly agitated or swelling with obscure cunning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet he learnt that the place was comparatively empty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the great political convulsion of the last few days</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reduced transactions to an unprecedented minimum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In one huge place were long avenues of roulette tables,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each with an excited, undignified crowd about it; in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other a yelping Babel of white-faced women and red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necked leathery-lunged men bought and sold the shares</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an absolutely fictitious business undertaking which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every five minutes, paid a dividend of ten per cent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cancelled a certain proportion of its shares by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lottery wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These business activities were prosecuted with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy that readily passed into violence, and Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching a dense crowd found at its centre a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of prominent merchants in violent controversy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth and nails on some delicate point of business eti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quette. Something still remained in life to be fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for. Further he had a shock at a vehement announce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in phonetic letters of scarlet flame, each twice the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of a man, that "We Assure the Propraiet'r.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We Assure the Propraiet'r."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who's the proprietor?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what do they assure me?" he asked. "What do</seg><seg type="columnLine">they assure me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't you have assurance?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham thought. "Insurance?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--Insurance. I remember that was the older</seg><seg type="columnLine">word. They are insuring your life. Dozands of people</seg><seg type="columnLine">are taking out policies, myriads of lions are being put</seg><seg type="columnLine">on you. And further on other people are buying an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuities. They do that on everybody who is at all promi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent. Look there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A crowd of people surged and roared, and Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a vast black screen suddenly illuminated in still</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger letters of burning purple. "Anuetes on the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">praiet'r--x 5 pr. G." The people began to boo and shout</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this, a number of hard breathing, wild-eyed men came</seg><seg type="columnLine">running past, clawing with hooked fingers at the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a furious crush about a little doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Asano did a brief calculation. "Seventeen per cent per</seg><seg type="columnLine">annum is their annuity on you. They would not pay so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much per cent if they could see you now, Sire. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not know. Your own'annuities used to be a very safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">investment, but now you are sheer gambling, of course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is probably a desperate bid. I doubt if people will</seg><seg type="columnLine">get their money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd of would-be annuitants grew so thick about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them that for some time they could move neither forward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nor backward. Graham noticed what appeared to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a high proportion of women among the speculators,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was reminded again of the economical independence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their sex. They seemed remarkably well able to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of themselves in the crowd, using their elbows with</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular skill, as he learnt to his cost. One curly-headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">person caught in the pressure for a space, looked stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastly at him several times, almost as if she recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and then, edging deliberately towards him, touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand with her arm in a scarcely accidental manner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made it plain by a look as ancient as Chaldea that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found favor in her eyes. And then a lank, grey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearded man, perspiring copiously in a noble passion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-help, blind to all earthly things save that glaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">bait, thrust between them in a cataclysmal rush towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">that alluring "x 5 pr. G."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to get out of this," said Graham to Asano.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is not what I came to see. Show me the workers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to see the people in blue. These parasitic luna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tics--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found himself wedged in a struggling mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, and this hopeful sentence went unfinished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            CHAPTER XXI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            The Under Side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FROM the Business Quarter they presently passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the running ways into a remote quarter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, where the bulk of the manufactures was done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On their way the platforms crossed the Thames twice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and passed in a broad viaduct across one of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads that entered the city from the North. In both</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases his impression was swift and in both very vivid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black sea water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">overarched by buildings, and vanishing either way into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blackness starred with receding lights. A string of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black barges passed seaward, manned by blue-clad men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The road was a long and very broad and high tunnel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">along which big-wheeled machines drove noiselessly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly. Here, too, the distinctive blue of the Labor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Company was in abundance. The smoothness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">double tracks, the largeness and the lightness of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">pneumatic wheels in proportion to the vehicular body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck Graham most vividly. One lank and very high</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriage with longitudinal metallic rods hung with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention unduly. Abruptly the edge of the archway cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blotted out the picture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently they left the way and descended by a lift</seg><seg type="columnLine">and traversed a passage that sloped downward, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a descending lift again. The appearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things changed. Even the pretence of architectural or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nament disappeared, the lights diminished in number and</seg><seg type="columnLine">size, the architecture became more and more massive in</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportion to the spaces as the factory quarters were</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached. And in the dusty biscuit-making place of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">potters, among the felspar mills, in the furnace rooms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal workers, among the incandescent lakes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude Eadhamite, the blue canvas clothing was on man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman and child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many of these great and dusty galleries were silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenues of machinery, endless raked out ashen furnaces</seg><seg type="columnLine">testified to the revolutionary dislocation, but wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was work it was being done by slow-moving work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers in blue canvas. The only people not in blue canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the overlookers of the work-places and the orange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad Labor Police. And fresh from the flushed faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dancing halls, the voluntary vigors of the business</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter, Graham could note the pinched faces, the feeble</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles, and weary eyes of many of the latter-day work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers. Such as he saw at work were noticeably inferior in</seg><seg type="columnLine">physique to the few gaily dressed managers and fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">women who were directing their labors. The burly la-</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">115</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lorers of the old Victorian times had followed the dray</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse and all such living force producers, to extinction;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place of his costly muscles was taken by some dex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terous machine. The latter-day laborer, male as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">female, was essentially a machine-minder and feeder, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant and attendant, or an artist under direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The women, in comparison with those Graham remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered, were as a class distinctly plain and flat chested.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two hundred years of emancipation from the moral re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">straints of Puritanical religion, two hundred years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">city life, had done their work in eliminating the strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of feminine beauty and vigor from the blue canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">myriads. To be brilliant physically or mentally, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any way attractive or exceptional, had been and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still a certain way of emancipation to the drudge, a line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of escape to the Pleasure City and its splendors and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights, and at last to the Euthanasy and peace. To be</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadfast against such inducements was scarcely to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected of meanly nourished souls. In the young cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Graham's former life, the newly aggregated laboring</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass had been a diverse multitude, still stirred by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tradition of personal honor and a high morality; now it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was differentiating into a distinct class, with a moral</seg><seg type="columnLine">and physical difference of its own--even with a dialect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They penetrated downward, ever downward, towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the working places. Presently they passed underneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the streets of the moving ways, and saw its plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms running on their rails far overhead, and chinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of white lights between the transverse slits. The fac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tories that were not working were sparsely lighted; to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham they and their shrouded aisles of giant machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed plunged in gloom, and even where work was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on the illumination was far less brilliant than</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the public ways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the blazing lakes of Eadhamite he came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warren of the jewelers, and, with some difficulty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by using his signature, obtained admission to these gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leries. They were high and dark, and rather cold. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first a few men were making ornaments of gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">filagree, each man at a little bench by himself, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little shaded light. The long vista of light patches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the nimble fingers brightly lit and moving among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gleaming yellow coils, and the intent face like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of a ghost, in each shadow, had the oddest effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The work was beautifully executed, but without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of modeling or drawing, for the most part</seg><seg type="columnLine">intricate grotesques or the ringing of the changes on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">geometrical motif. These workers wore a peculiar white</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform without pockets or sleeves. They assumed this</seg><seg type="columnLine">on coming to work, but at night they were stripped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined before they left the premises of the Company.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In spite of every precaution, the Labor policeman told</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in a depressed tone, the Company was not infre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently robbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond was a gallery of women busied in cutting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting slabs of artificial ruby, and next these were men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women busied together upon the slabs of copper net</seg><seg type="columnLine">that formed the basis of cloisonne tiles. Many of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers had lips and nostrils a livid white, due to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease caused by a peculiar purple enamel that chanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be much in fashion. Asano apologized to Graham for</seg><seg type="columnLine">(he offense of their faces, but excused himself on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">score of convenience of this route. "This is what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to see," said Graham; "this is what I wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see," trying to avoid a start at a particularly striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">disfigurement that suddenly stared him in the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She might have done better with herself than that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Asano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham made some indignant comments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Sire, "we simply could not stand that stuff with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the purple," said Asano. "In your days people could</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand such crudities, they were nearer the barbaric by</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY continued along one of the lower galleries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this cloisonne factory, and came to a little bridge that</seg><seg type="columnLine">spanned a vault. Looking over the parapet, Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that beneath was a wharf under yet more tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">archings than any he had seen. Three barges, smothered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in floury dust, were being unloaded of their cargoes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">powdered felspar by a multitude of coughing men, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">guiding a little truck; the dust filled the place with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">choking mist, and turned the electric glare yellow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague shadows of these workers gesticulated about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, and rushed to and fro against a long stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitewashed wall. Every now and then one would stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shadowy, huge mass of masonry rising out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inky water, brought to Graham's mind the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the multitude of ways and galleries and lifts, that rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor above floor overhead between him and the sky. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">men worked in silence under the supervision of two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Labor Police; their feet made a hollow thunder on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plunks along which they went to and fro. And as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at this scene, some hidden voice in the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to sing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop that!" shouted one of the policemen, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order was disobeyed, and first one and then all the white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained men who were working there had taken up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating refrain, singing it defiantly, the Song of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Revolt. The feet upon the planks thundered now to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythm of the song, tramp, tramp, tramp. The police-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had shouted glanced at his fellow, and Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him shrug his shoulders. He made no further effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop the singing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so they went through these factories and places</seg><seg type="columnLine">of toil, seeing many painful and grim things. But why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should the gentle reader be depressed? Surely to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">refined nature our present world is distressing enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">without bothering ourselves about these miseries to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. We shall not suffer anyhow. Our children may,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what is that to us? That walk left on Graham's mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">a maze of memories, fluctuating pictures of swathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">halls, and crowded vaults seen through clouds of dust, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">intricate machines, the racing threads of looms, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy beat of stamping machinery, the roar and rattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of belt and armature, of ill-lit subterranean aisles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping places, illimitable vistas of pin-point lights. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">here the smell of tanning, and here the reek of a brewery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and here, unprecedented reeks. And everywhere were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillars and cross archings of such a massiveness as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham had never before seen, thick Titans of greasy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining brickwork crushed beneath the vast weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that complex city world, even as these anzemic millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">were crushed by its complexity. And everywhere were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale features, lean limbs, disfigurement and degradation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once and again, and again a third time, Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the song of the revolt during his long, unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">research in these places, and once he saw a confused</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle down a passage, and learnt that a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these serfs had seized their bread before their work</seg><seg type="columnLine">was done. Graham was ascending towards the ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">again when he saw a number of blue-clad children run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning down a transverse passage, and presently perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reason of their panic in a company of the Labor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Police armed with clubs, trotting toward some unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbance. And then came a remote disorder. But for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most part this remnant that worked, worked hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly. All the spirit that was left in fallen humanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">was above in the streets that night, calling for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master, and valiantly and noisily keeping its arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They emerged from these wanderings and stood blink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the bright light of the middle passage of the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms again. They became aware of the remote hooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yelping of the machines of one of the General Intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence Offices, and suddenly came men running, and along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platforms and about the ways everywhere was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting and crying. Then a woman with a face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">316</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ho saw a confuscd struggle down a passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mute white terror, and another who gasped and shrieked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has happened now?" said Graham puzzled, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not understand their thick speech. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard it in English and perceived that the thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone was shouting, that men yelled to one another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that women took up screaming, that was passing like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first breeze of a thunderstorm, chill and sudden through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city, was this: "Ostrog has ordered the Black Police</seg><seg type="columnLine">to London. The Black Police are coming from South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Africa. . . . The Black Police. The Black Police."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asano's face was white and astonished: he hesitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at Graham's face, and told him the thing he al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready knew. "But how can they know?" asked Asano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham heard someone shouting. "Stop all work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stop all work," and a swarthy hunchback, ridiculously</seg><seg type="columnLine">gay in green and gold, came leaping down the platforms</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him, bawling again and again in good English,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is Ostrog's doing, Ostrog, the Knave! The Master</seg><seg type="columnLine">is betrayed." His voice was hoarse and a thin foam</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped from his ugly shouting mouth. He yelled an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unspeakable horror that the Black Police had done in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris, and so passed shrieking, "Ostrog the Knave!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Graham stood still, for it had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him again that these things were a dream. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up at the great cliff of buildings on either side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanishing into blue haze at last above the lights, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the roaring tiers of platforms, and the shouting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">running people who were gesticulating past. "The Mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter is betrayed!" they cried. "The Master is betrayed!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the situation shaped itself in his mind real</seg><seg type="columnLine">and urgent. His heart began to beat fast and strong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has come," he said. "I might have known. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour has come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought swiftly. "What am I to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go back to the Council House," said Asano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why should I not appeal--? The people are here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You will lose time. They will doubt if it is you. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will mass about the Council House. There you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">find their leaders. Your strength is there--with them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Suppose this is only a rumor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It sounds true," said Asano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us have the facts," said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Asano shrugged his shoulders. "We had better get</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Council House," he cried. "That is where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will swarm. Even now the ruins may be impass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham regarded him doubtfully and followed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went up the stepped platforms to the swiftest</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, and there Asano accosted a laborer. The answers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his questions were in the thick, vulgar speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did he say?" asked Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He knows little, but he told me that the Black Police</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have arrived here before the people knew--had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone in the Wind-Vane Offices learnt. He said a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A girl? Not--?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He said a girl--he did not know who she was--who</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out from the Council House crying aloud, and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men at work among the ruins."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then another thing was shouted, something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned an aimless tumult into determinate movements,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came like a wind along the street. "To your Wards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your Wards. Every man get arms. Every man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Ward!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXII</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Struggle in the Council House</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASANO and Graham hurried along to the ruins about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Council House; they saw everywhere the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement of the people rising. "To your Wards!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">To your Wards!" Everywhere men and women in blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hurrying from unknown subterranean employments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the staircases of the middle path; at one place Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw an arsenal of the revolutionary committee beseiged</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a crowd of shouting men, at another a couple of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hated yellow uniform of the Labor Police, pursued</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a gathering crowd, fled precipitately along the swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">way that went in the opposite direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cries of "To your Wards!" became at last a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuous shouting as they drew near the Government</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter. Many of the shouts were unintelligible. "Os-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trog has betrayed us," one man bawled in a hoarse voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and again, dinning that refrain into Graham's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear until it haunted him. This person stayed close be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side Graham and Asano on the swift way, shouting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people who swarmed on the lower platforms as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed past them. His cry about Ostrog alternated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some incomprehensible orders. Presently he went leap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down and disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham's mind was filled with the din. His plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">were vague and unformed. He had one picture of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanding position from which he could address the</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitudes, another of meeting Ostrog face to face. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was full of rage, of tense muscular excitement, his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped, his lips were pressed together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The way to the Council House across the ruins was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impassable, but Asano met that difficulty and took Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham into the premises of the central post-office. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">post-office was nominally at work, but the blue-clothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">porters moved sluggishly or had stopped to stare through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arches of their galleries at the shouting men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going by outside. "Every man to his Ward! Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to his Ward!" Here, by Asano's advice, Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed his identity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They crossed to the Council House by a cable cradle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Already in the brief interval since the capitulation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Councillors a great change had been wrought in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appearance of the ruins. The spurting cascades of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ruptured sea water-mains had been captured or</seg><seg type="columnLine">tamed, and huge temporary pipes ran overhead along a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flimsy looking fabric of girders. The sky was laced with</seg><seg type="columnLine">restored cables and wires that served the Council House,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a mass of new fabric with cranes and other building</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines going to and fro upon it, projected to the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the white pile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moving ways that ran across this area had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">restored, albeit for once running under the open sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These were the ways that Graham had seen from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little balcony in the hour of his awakening, not nine days</seg><seg type="columnLine">since, and the hall of his Trance had been on the further</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">side, where now shapeless piles of smashed and shattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">masonry were heaped together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was already high day and the sun was shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly. Out of their tall caverns of blue electric light</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the swift ways crowded with multitudes of people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who poured off them and gathered ever denser over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreckage and confusion of the ruins. The air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of their shouting, and they were pressing and sway-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing towards the central building. For the most part</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shouting mass consisted of shapeless swarms, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there Graham could see that a rude discipline</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled to establish itself. And every voice clamored</seg><seg type="columnLine">for order in the chaos. "To your Wards! Every man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his Ward!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cable carried them into a hall which Graham rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognized as the ante-chamber to the Hall of the Atlas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the gallery of which he had walked days ago with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howard to show himself to the vanished Council, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour from his awakening. Now the place was empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for two cable attendants. These men seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hugely astonished to recognize the Sleeper in the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who swung down from the cross seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is Helen Wotton?" he demanded. "Where is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen Wotton?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They did not know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then where is Ostrog? I must see Ostrog forth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">with. He has disobeyed me. I have come back to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">things out of his hands." Without waiting for Asano,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went straight across the place, ascended the steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the further end, and pulling the curtain aside found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself facing the perpetually laboring Titan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hall was empty. Its appearance had changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">very greatly since his first sight of it. It had suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious injury in the violent struggle of the first out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">break. On the right hand side of the great figure the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper half of the wall had been torn away for nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred feet of its length, and a sheet of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">glassy film that had enclosed Graham at his awakening</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been drawn across the gap. This deadened, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not altogether exclude the roar of the people outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wards! Wards! Wards" they seemed to be saying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through it there were visible the beams and supports</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal scaffoldings that rose and fell according to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">requirements of a great crowd of workmen. An idle</seg><seg type="columnLine">building machine, with lank arms of red painted metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">that caught the still plastic blocks of mineral paste and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung them neatly into position, stretched gauntly across</seg><seg type="columnLine">this green tinted picture. On it were still a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">workmen staring at the crowd below. For a moment he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood regarding these things, and Asano overtook him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ostrog," said Asano, "will be in the small offices</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond there." The little man looked livid now and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes searched Graham's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had scarcely advanced ten paces from the cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain before a little panel to the left of the Atlas rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and Ostrog, accompanied by Lincoln and followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by two black and yellow clad negroes, appeared crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remote corner of the hall, toward a second panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was raised and open. "Ostrog," shouted Graham,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at the sound of his voice the little party turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ostrog said something to Lincoln and advanced alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham was the first to speak. His voice was loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dictatorial. "What is this I hear?" he asked. "Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you bringing negroes here--to keep the people down?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is none too soon," said Ostrog. "They have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting out of hand more and more, since the revolt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I under-estimated--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you mean that these infernal negroes are on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On the way. As it is, you have seen the people--</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No wonder! But--after what was said. You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken too much on yourself, Ostrog."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ostrog said nothing, but drew nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These negroes must not come to London," said Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham. "I am Master and they shall not come.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ostrog glanced at Lincoln, who at once came towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with his two attendants close behind him. "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">not?" asked Ostrog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "White men must be mastered by white men. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The negroes are only an instrument."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that is not the question. I am the Master. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean to be the Master. And I tell you these negroes</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall not come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The people--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe in the people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because you are an anachronism. You are a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the Past--an accident. You are Owner perhaps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">half the property in the world. But you are not Master.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You do not know enough to be Master."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced at Lincoln again. "I know now what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think--I can guess something of what you mean to do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even now it is not too late to warn you. You dream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human equality--of a socialistic order--you have all those</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn-out dreams of the nineteenth century fresh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid in your mind, and you would rule this age that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do not understand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen!" said Graham. "You can hear it--a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the sea. Not voices--but a voice. Do you altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We taught them that," said Ostrog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps. Can you teach them to forget it? But</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough of this! These negroes must not come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a pause and Ostrog looked him in the eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They will," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I forbid it," said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have started."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will not have it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Ostrog. "Sorry as I am to follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of the Council--. For your own good--you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">not side with--Disorder. And now that you are here--.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was kind of you to come here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LINCOLN laid his hand on Graham's shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruptly Graham realized the enormity of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blunder in coming to the Council House. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the curtains that separated the hall from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ante-chamber. The clutching hand of Asano intervened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In another moment Lincoln had grasped Graham's cloak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and struck at Lincoln's face, and incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinently a negro had him by collar and arm. He wrenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself away, his sleeve tore noisily, and he stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, to be tripped by the other attendant. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the ground heavily and he was staring at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant ceiling of the hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shouted, rolled over, struggling fiercely, clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">an attendant's leg and threw him headlong, and struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lincoln appeared before him, went down heavily again</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a blow under the point of the jaw and lay still.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham made two strides, stumbled. And then Ostrog's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm was round his neck, he was pulled over backward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell heavily, and his arms were pinned to the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a few violent efforts, he ceased to struggle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay staring at Ostrog's heaving throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You--are--a prisoner," panted Ostrog, exulting. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">--were rather a fool--to come back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham turned his head about and perceived through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the irregular green window in the walls of the hall the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who had been working the building cranes gesticu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating excitedly to the people below them. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ostrog followed his eyes and started. He shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to Lincoln, but Lincoln did not move. A bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed among the mouldings above the Atlas. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheets of transparent matter that had been stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">118</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">across the gap were rent, the edges of the torn aperture</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened, curved, ran rapidly towards the framework, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a moment the Council chamber stood open to the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A chilly gust blew in by the gap, bringing with it a war</seg><seg type="columnLine">of voices from the ruinous spaces without, an elvish bab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blement, "Save the Master!" "What are they doing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Master?" "The Master is betrayed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he realized that Ostrog's attention was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted, that Ostrog's grip had relaxed, and, wrenching</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms free, he struggled to his knees. In another</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he had thrust Ostrog back, and lie was on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot, his hand gripping Ostrog's throat, and Ostrog's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands clutching the silk about his neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now men were coming towards them from the dais</seg><seg type="columnLine">--men whose intentions he misunderstood. He had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of someone running in the distance towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtains of the antechamber, and then Ostrog had slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him and these newcomers were upon him. To his</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinite astonishment, they seized him. They obeyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts of Ostrog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was lugged a dozen yards before he realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were not friends--that they were dragging him</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the open panel. When he saw this he pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, he tried to fling himself down, he shouted for help</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all his strength. And this time there were answer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grip upon his neck relaxed, and behold, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower corner of the rent upon the wall, first one and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a number of little black figures appeared shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waving arms. They came leaping down from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gap into the light gallery that had led to the Silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rooms. They ran along it, so near were they that Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham could see the weapons in their hands. Then Ostrog</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shouting in his ear to the men who held him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more he was struggling with all his strength against</seg><seg type="columnLine">their endeavors to thrust him towards the opening that</seg><seg type="columnLine">yawned to receive him. "They can't come down," panted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ostrog. "They daren't fire. It's all right." "We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">save him from them yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For long minutes as it seemed to Graham that in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious struggle continued. His clothes were rent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen places, he was covered in dust, one hand had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been trodden upon. He could hear the shouts of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">supporters, and once he heard shots. He could feel his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength giving way, feel his efforts wild and aimless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But no help came, and surely, irresistibly, that black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yawning opening came nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pressure upon him relaxed and he struggled up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw Ostrog's grey head receding and perceived that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was no longer held. He turned about and came full</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a man in black. One of the green weapons cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to him, a drift of pungent smoke came into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and a steel blade flashed. The huge chamber span</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw a man in pale blue stabbing one of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yellow attendants not three yards from his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then hands were upon him again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was being pulled in two directions now. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though people were shouting to him. He wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand and could not. Someone was clutching about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thighs, he was being hoisted in spite of his vigorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts. He understood suddenly, he ceased to struggle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was lifted up on men's shoulders and carried away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that devouring panel. Ten thousand throats were</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw men in blue and black hurrying after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreating Ostrogites and firing. Lifted up, he saw now</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the whole expanse of the hall beneath the Atlas</seg><seg type="columnLine">image, saw that he was being carried towards the raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform in the center of the place. The far end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall was already full of people running towards him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were looking at him and cheering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He became aware that a sort of body-guard surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Active men about him shouted vague orders. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">saw close at hand the black moustached man in yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been among those who had greeted him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public theatre, shouting directions. The hall was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">densely packed with swaying people, the little metal gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lery sagged with a shouting load, the curtains at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end had been torn away, and the ante-chamber was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed densely crowded. He could scarcely make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man near him hear for the tumult about them. "Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">has Ostrog gone?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The man he questioned pointed over the heads towards</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the lower panels about the hall on the side opposite the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gap. They stood open and armed men, blue clad with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">black sashes, were running through them and vanishing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the chambers and passages beyond. It seemed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Graham that a sound of firing drifted through the riot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was carried in a staggering curve across the great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hall towards an opening beneath the gap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He perceived men working with a sort of rude disci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pline to keep the crowd off him, to make a space clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. He passed out of the hall, and saw a crude,</seg><seg type="columnLine">new wall rising blankly before him topped by blue sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was swung down to his feet; someone gripped his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and guided him. He found the man in yellow close at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. They were taking him up a narrow stairway of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brick, and close at hand rose the great red painted masses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cranes and levers and the still engines of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">building machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was at the top of the steps. He was hurried across</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a narrow railed footway, and suddenly with a vast shout-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing the amphitheatre of ruins opened again before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The Master is with us! The Master! The Master!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The shout swept athwart the lake of faces like a wave,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">broke against the distant cliff of ruins, and came back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a welter of cries. "The Master is on our side!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GRAHAM perceived that he was no longer encom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed by people, that he was standing upon a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">temporary platform of white metal, part of a flimsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming scaffolding that laced about the great mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Council House. Over all the huge expanse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins, swayed and .'ddied the shouting people; and here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there the black banners of the revolutionary socie-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties ducked and swayed and formed rare nuclei of or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganization in the chaos. Up the steep stairs of wall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scaffolding by which his rescuers had reached the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Atlas Chamber, clung a solid crowd, and little ener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getic black figures clinging to pillars and projections</seg><seg type="columnLine">were strenuous to induce these congested masses to stir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind him, at a higher point on the scaffolding, a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of men struggled upwards with the flapping folds of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge black standard. Through the yawning gap in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls below him he could look down upon the packed at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentive multitudes in the Hall of the Atlas. The distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying stages to the south came out bright and vivid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought nearer as it seemed by an unusual translucency</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air. A solitary aeropile beat up from the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tral stage as if to meet the coming aeroplanes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What had become of Ostrog?" asked Graham, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as he spoke he saw that all eyes were turned from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him towards the crest of the Council House building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked also in this direction of universal attention.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment he saw nothing but the jagged corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wall, hard and clear against the sky. Then in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow he perceived the interior of a room and recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a start the green and white decorations of his for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer prison. And coming quickly across this opened room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and up to the very verge of the cliff of the ruins came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little white clad figure followed by two other smaller seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing figures in black and yellow. He heard the man beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him exclaim "Ostrog," and turned to ask a question. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he never did, because of the startled exclamation of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other of those who were with him and a lang finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly pointing. He looked, and beheld the aeropile</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been rising from the flying stage when last</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he had looked in that direction, was driving towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The swift steady flight was still novel enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold his attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nearer it came, growing rapidly larger and larger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it had swept over the further edge of the ruins and</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view of the dense multitudes below. It drooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the space and rose and passed overhead, rising to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear the mass of the Council House, a filmy translucent</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape with the solitai-- aeronaut peering down through</seg><seg type="columnLine">its ribs. It vanished beyond the skyline of the ruins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham transferred his attention to Ostrog. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">signalling with his hands, and his attendants were busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking down the wall beside him. In another moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aeropile came into view again, a little thing far away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming round in a wide curve and going slower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly the man in yellow shouted: "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">are they doing? What are the people doing? Why is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ostrog left there? Why is he not captured? They will</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift him--the aeropile will lift him! Ah!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The exclamation was echoed by a shout from the ruins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rattling sound of the green weapons drifted across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intervening gulf to Graham, and, looking down, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a number of black and yellow uniforms running</seg><seg type="columnLine">along one of the galleries that lay open to the air below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the promontory upon which Ostrog stood. They fired as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ran at men unseen, and then emerged a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale blue figures in pursuit. These minute fighting fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures had the oddest effect; they seemed as they ran like</seg><seg type="columnLine">little model soldiers in a toy. This queer appearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a house cut open gave that struggle amidst furniture and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passages a quality of unreality. It was perhaps two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards away from him, and very nearly fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the heads in the ruins below. The black and yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low men ran into an open archway, and turned and fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">a volley. One of the blue pursuers striding forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the edge, flung up his arms, staggered sideways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to Graham's sense to hang over the edge for sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral seconds, and fell headlong down. Graham saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike a projecting corner, fly out, head over heels, head</seg><seg type="columnLine">over heels, and vanish behind the red arm of the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then a shadow came between Graham and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. He looked up and the sky was clear, but he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aeropile had passed. Ostrog had vanished. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in yellow thrust before him, zealous and perspiring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing and blatent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are grounding!" cried the man in yellow'. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are grounding! Tell the people to fire at him. Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to fire at him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham could not understand. He heard loud voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeating these enigmatical orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly over the edge of the ruins he saw the prow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the aeropile come gliding and stop with a jerk. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment Graham understood that the thing had grounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order that Ostrog might escape by it. He saw a blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">haze climbing out of the gulf, perceived that the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">below him were now firing up at the projecting stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man beside him cheered hoarsely, and he saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue rebels had gained the archway that had been con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested by the men in black and yellow a moment before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were running in a continual stream along the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And suddenly the aeropile slipped over the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">che Council House and fell. It dropped, tilting at an angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of forty-five degrees, and dropping so steeply that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to Graham, it seemed perhaps to most of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, that it could not possibly rise again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It fell so closely past him that he could see Ostrog</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching the guides of the seat, with his grey hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaming; see the white-faced aeronaut wrenching over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lever that drove the engine along its guides. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the apprehensive vague cry of innumerable men</seg><seg type="columnLine">below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham clutched the railing before him and gasped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The second seemed an age. The lower van of the aeropile</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed within an ace of touching the people, who yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and screamed and trampled one another below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then it rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment it looked as if it could not possibly clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite cliff, and then that it could not possibly clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind-wheel that rotated beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And behold! it was clear and soaring, still heeling side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, upward into the wind-swept sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The suspense of the moment gave place to a fury of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exasperation as the swarming people realized that Ostrog</seg><seg type="columnLine">had escaped them. With belated activity they renewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fire, until the rattling wove into a roar, until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole area became dim and blue and the air pungent with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thin smoke of their weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Too late! The aeropile dwindled smaller and smaller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and curved about and swept gracefully downward to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying stage from which it had so lately risen. Ostrog</seg><seg type="columnLine">had escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a while a confused babblement arose from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins, and then the universal attention came back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham, perched high among the scaffolding. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faces of the people turned towards him, heard their</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts at his rescue. From the throat of the ways came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the song of the revolt spreading like a breeze across that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying sea of men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little group of men about him shouted congratu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lations on his escape. The man in yellow was close to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a set face and shining eyes. And the song was ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, louder and louder; tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly the realization came of the full meaning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things to him, the perception of the swift change in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his position. Ostrog, who had stood beside him when-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever he had faced that shouting multitude before, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond there--the antagonist. There was no one to rule</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him any longer. Even the people about him, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaders and organizers of the multitude, looked to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he would do, looked to him to act, awaited his or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders. He was King indeed. His puppet reign was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">an end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was very intent to do the thing that was expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him. His nerves and muscles were quivering, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind was perhaps a little confused, but he felt neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear nor anger. His hand that had been trodden upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbed and was hot. He was a little nervous about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bearing. He knew he was not afraid, but he was anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious not to seem afraid. In his former life he had often</seg><seg type="columnLine">been more excited in playing games of skill. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">desirous of immediate action, ho knew he must not think</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much in detail of the huge complexity of the struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him lest he should be paralysed by the sense of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">intricacy. Over there those square blue shapes, the fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stages, meant Ostrog; against Ostrog he was fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">While the Aeroplanes Were Coming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a time the Master of the Earth was not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">master of his own mind. Even his will seemed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not his own, his own acts surprised him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were but a part of the confusion of strange experiences</seg><seg type="columnLine">that poured across his being. These things were defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nite, the aeroplanes were coming, Helen Wotton had</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned the people of their coming, and he was Master</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Earth. Each of these facts seemed struggling for</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete possession of his thoughts. They protruded</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a background of swarming halls, elevated passages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms jammed with ward leaders in council, kinemato-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph and telephone rooms, and windows looking out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a seething sea of marching men. The man in yellow, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">men whom he fancied W'ere called Ward Leaders, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">either propelling him forward or following him obedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">120</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ently; it was hard to tell. Perhaps they were doing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little of both. Perhaps some power unseen and unsus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected, propelled them all. He was aware that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to make a proclamation to the People of the Earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of certain grandiose phrases floating in his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the thing he meant to say. Many little things hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, and then he found himself with the man in yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering a little room where this proclamation of his was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This room was grotesquely latter-day in its appoint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. In the centre was a bright oval lit by shaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric lights from above. The rest was in shadow, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the double finely fitting doors through which he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the swarming Hall of the Atlas made the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">very still. The dead thud of these as they closed behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, the sudden cessation of the tumult in which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been living for hours, the quivering circle of light, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispers and quick noiseless movements of vaguely</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible attendants in the shadows, had a strange effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Graham. The huge ears of a phonographic mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anism gaped in a battery for his words, the black eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of great photographic cameras awaited his beginning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond metal rods and coils glittered dimly, and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing whirled about with a droning hum. He walked into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the centre of the light, and his shadow drew together</seg><seg type="columnLine">black and sharp to a little blot at his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vague shape of the thing he meant to say was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already in his mind. But this silence, this isolation, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden withdrawal from that contagious crowd, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent audience of gaping, glaring machines had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in his anticipation. All his supporters seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrawn together; he seemed to have dropped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">this suddenly, suddenly to have discovered himself. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he was changed. He found that he now feared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be inadequate, he feared to be theatrical, he feared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality of his voice, the quality of his wit. Astonished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned to the man in yellow with a propitiatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture. "For a moment," he said, "I must wait. I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not think it would be like this. I must think of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I have to say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While he was still hesitating there came an agitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">messenger with news that the foremost aeroplanes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing over Arawan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Arawan?" he said. "Where is that? But anyhow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are coming. They will be here. When?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By twilight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great God! In only a few hours. What news of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying stages?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The people of the south-west wards are ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ready!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned impatiently to the blank circles of the lenses</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose it must be a sort of speech. Would to</seg><seg type="columnLine">God I knew certainly the thing that should be said!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aeroplanes at Arawan! They must have started before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main fleet. And the people only ready! Surely . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh! what does it matter whether I speak well or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill?" he said, and felt the light grow brighter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had framed some vague sentence of democratic</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentiment when suddenly doubts overwhelmed him. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief in his heroic quality and calling he found had</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether lost its assured conviction. The picture of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little strutting futility in a windy waste of incompre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensible destinies replaced it. Abruptly it was perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear to him that this revolt against Ostrog was prema-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, foredoomed to failure, the impulse of passionate</seg><seg type="columnLine">inadequacy against inevitable things. He thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that swift flight of aeroplanes like the swoop of Fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards him. He was astonished that he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen things in any other light. In that final emergency</seg><seg type="columnLine">he debated, thrust debate resolutely aside, determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all costs to go through with the thing he had under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken. And he could find no word to begin. Even as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood awkward, hesitating, with an indiscreet apology</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for his inability trembling on his lips, came the noise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many people crying out, the running to and fro of feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wait," cried someone, and a door opened. "She is com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing," said the voices. Graham turned, and the watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights waned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the open doorway he saw a slight grey figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing across a spacious hall. His heart leapt. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Helen Wotton. Behind and about her marched a</seg><seg type="columnLine">riot of applause. The man in yellow came out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer shadows into the circle of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the girl who told us what Ostrog had done,':</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her face was aflame, and the heavy coils of her black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair fell about her shoulders. The folds of the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk robe she wore streamed from her and floated in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythm of her advance. She drew nearer and nearer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his heart was beating fast. All his doubts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. The shadow of the doorway fell athwart her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she was near him. "You have not betrayed us?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she cried. "You are with us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where have you been?" said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At the office of the south-west wards. Until ten min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes since I did not know you had returned. I went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office of the south-west wards to find the Ward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leaders in order that they might tell the people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I came back as soon as I heard--."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew," she cried, "knew you would be with us. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was I--it was I that told them. They have risen. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world is rising. The people have awakened. Thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">God that I did not act in vain! You are Master still."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You told them," he said slowly, and he saw that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of her steady eyes her lips trembled and her throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told them. I knew of the order. I was here. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard that the negroes were to come to London to guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and keep the people down--to keep you a prisoner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I stopped it. I came out and told the people. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are master still."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham glanced at the black lenses of the cameras,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vast listening ears, and back to her face. "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master still," he said slowly, and the swift rush of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet of aeroplanes passed across his thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you did this? You, who are the niece of Ostrog."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For you," she cried. "For you! That you for whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world has waited should not be cheated of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham stood for a space, wordless, regarding her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His doubts and questionings had fled before her presence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He remembered the things that he had meant to say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He faced the cameras again and the light about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew brighter. He turned again towards her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have saved me," he said; "you have saved my</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. And the battle is beginning. God knows what</seg><seg type="columnLine">this night shall see--but not dishonor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused. He addressed himself to those unseen</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitudes who stared upon him through those grotesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">black eyes. At first he spoke slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men and women of the new age," he said, "You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">arisen to do battle for the race! . . . There is no easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">victory before us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE stopped to gather words. The thoughts that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in his mind before she came returned, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">transfigured, no longer touched with the shadow of a pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible irrelevance. "This night is a beginning," he cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This battle that is coming, this battle that rushes upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">us tonight, is only a beginning. All your lives, it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, you must fight. Take no thought though I am beaten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I am utterly overthrown."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found the thing in his mind too vague for words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He paused momentarily, and broke into vague exhorta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, and then a rush of speech came upon him. Much</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he said was but the humanitarian commonplace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vanished age, but the conviction of his voice touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">121</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it to vitality. He stated the case of the old days to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people of the new age, to the woman at his side. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out of the past to you," he said, "with the memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an age that hoped. My age was an age of dreams--</seg><seg type="columnLine">of beginnings, an age of noble hopes; throughout the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world we had made an end of slavery; throughout the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world we had spread the desire and anticipation that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wars might cease, that all men and women might live</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobly, in freedom and peace. ... So we hoped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the days that are past. And what of those hopes? How</seg><seg type="columnLine">is it with man after two hundred years?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great cities, vast powers, a collective greatness be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond our dreams. For that we did not work, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">has come. But how is it with the little lives that make</seg><seg type="columnLine">up this greater life? How is it with the common lives?</seg><seg type="columnLine">As it has been--sorrow and labor, lives cramped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfulfilled, lives tempted by power, tempted by wealth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gone to waste and folly. The old faiths have faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and changed, the new faith--. Is there a new faith?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Things that he had long wished to believe, he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he believed. He plunged at belief and seized it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung for a time at her level. He spoke gustily, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken incomplete sentences, but with all his heart and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, of this new faith within him. He spoke of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatness of self-abnegation, of his belief in an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortal life of Humanity in which we live and move and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have our being. His voice rose and fell, and the record-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing appliances hummed their hurried applause, dim at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendants watched him out of the shadow. Through all</seg><seg type="columnLine">those doubtful places his sense of that silent spectator</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him sustained his sincerity. For a few glorious</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments he was carried away; he felt no doubt of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroic quality, no doubt of his heroic words, he had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all straight and plain. His eloquence limped no longer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And at last he made an end to speaking. "Here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now," he cried, "I make my will. All that is mine in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world I give to the people of the world. All that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine in the world I give to the people of the world. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">give it to you, and myself I give to you. And as God</seg><seg type="columnLine">wills, I will live for you, or I will die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ended with a florid gesture and turned about. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the light of his present exaltation reflected in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the girl. Their eyes met; her eyes were swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming with tears of enthusiasm. They seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">urged towards each other. They clasped hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood gripped, facing one another, in an eloquent silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She whispered. "I knew," she whispered. "I knew."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could not speak, he crushed her hand in his. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind was the theatre of gigantic passions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man in yellow was beside them. Neither had</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted his coming. He was saying that the south-west</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards were marching. "I never expected it so soon," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried. "They have done wonders. You must send them</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word to help them on their way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham dropped Helen's hand and stared at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">absent-mindedly. Then with a start he returned to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous preoccupation about the flying stages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he said. "That is good, that is good." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighed a message. "Tell them;--well done South</seg><seg type="columnLine">West."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned his eyes to Helen Wotton again. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed his struggle between conflicting ideas. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must capture the flying stages," he explained. "Unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can do that they will land negroes. At all costs we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must prevent that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt even as he spoke that this was not what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in his mind before the interruption. He saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of surprise in her eyes. She seemed about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak and a shrill bell drowned her voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It occurred to Graham that she expected him to lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">these marching people, that that was the thing he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. He made the offer abruptly. He addressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in yellow, but he spoke to her. He saw her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">respond. "Here I am doing nothing," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is impossible," protested the man in yellow. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fight in a warren. Your place is here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He explained elaborately. He motioned towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room where Graham must wait, he insisted no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">course was possible. "We must know where you are,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "At any moment a crisis may arise needing</seg><seg type="columnLine">your presence and decision." The room was a luxurious</seg><seg type="columnLine">little apartment with news machines and a broken mirror</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had once been en rapport with the crow's nest spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ula. It seemed a matter of course to Graham that Helen</seg><seg type="columnLine">should stop for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A PICTURE of such a vast dramatic struggle as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses in the ruins had suggested had drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his mind. But here was no spectacular battle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field such as he imagined. Instead was seclusion--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspense. It was only as the afternoon wore on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pieced together a truer picture of the fight that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging, inaudibly and invisibly, within four miles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, beneath the Roehampton stage. A strange and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">precedented contest it was, a battle that was a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand little battles, a battle in a sponge of ways and</seg><seg type="columnLine">channels, fought out of sight of sky or sun under the elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric glare, fought out in a vast confusion by multitudes</seg><seg type="columnLine">untrained in arms, led chiefly by acclamation, multitudes</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulled by mindless labor and enervated by the tradition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two hundred years of servile security against multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudes demoralized by lives of venial privilege and sensual</seg><seg type="columnLine">indulgence. They had no artillery, no differentiation into</seg><seg type="columnLine">this force or that; the only weapon on either side was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little green metal carbine, whose secret manufacture and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden distribution in enormous quantities had been one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ostrog's culminating moves against the Council. Few</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had any experience with this weapon, many had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharged one, many who carried it came unprovided</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ammunition; never was wilder firing in the history</seg><seg type="columnLine">of warfare. It was a battle of amateurs, a hideous ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perimental warfare, armed rioters fighting armed riot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, armed rioters swept forward by the words and fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a song, by the trampling sympathy of their numbers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring in countless myriads towards the smaller ways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disabled lifts, the galleries slippery with blood, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">halls and passages choked with smoke, beneath the flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">stages, to learn there when retreat was hopeless the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient mysteries of warfare. And overhead save for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few sharpshooters upon the roof spaces and for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">bands and threads of vapor that multiplied and darkened</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the evening, the day was a clear serenity. Os-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trog it seems had no bombs at command and in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier phases of the battle the aeropiles played no part.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not the smallest cloud was there to break the empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliance of the sky. It seemed as though it held itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacant until the aeroplanes should come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ever and again there was news of these, drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer, from this Mediterranean port and then that, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently from the south of France. But of the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns that Ostrog had made and which were known to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the city came no news in spite of Graham's urgency,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor any report of success from the dense felt of fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">strands about the flying stages. Section after section of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Labor Societies reported itself assembled, reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself marching, and vanished from knowledge into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">labyrinth of that warfare. What was happening there?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even the busy ward leaders did not know. In spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening and closing of doors, the hasty messengers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ringing of bells and the perpetual clitter-clack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">recording implements, Graham felt isolated, strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">inactive, inoperative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their isolation seemed at times the strangest, the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected of all the things that had happened since</seg><seg type="columnLine">his awakening. It had something of the quality of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">inactivity that comes in dreams. A tumult, the stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendous realization of a world struggle between Ostrog</seg><seg type="columnLine">and himself, and then this confined quiet little room</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its mouthpieces and bells and broken mirror!</seg><seg type="columnLine">122</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the door would be closed and they were alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">together; they seemed sharply marked off then from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unprecedented world storm that rushed together</seg><seg type="columnLine">without, vividly aware of one another, only concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one another. Then the door would open again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">messengers would enter, or a sharp bell would stab their</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet privacy, and it was like a window in a well built</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly lit house flung open suddenly to a hurricane. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark hurry and tumult, the stress and vehemence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle rushed in and overwhelmed them. They were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer persons but mere spectators, mere impressions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tremendous convulsion. They became unreal even to</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, miniatures of personality, indescribably</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, and the two antagonistic realities, the only realities</seg><seg type="columnLine">in being were first the city, that throbbed and roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">yonder in a belated frenzy of defence and secondly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeroplanes hurling inexorably towards them over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">round shoulder of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At first their mood had been one of exalted confidence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great pride had possessed them, a pride in one another</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the greatness of the issues they had challenged. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first he had walked the room eloquent with a transitory</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuasion of his tremendous destiny. But slowly un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy intimations of their coming defeat touched his spirit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There came a long period in which they were alone. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed his theme, became egotistical, spoke of the won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der of his sleep, of the little life of his memories, remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet minute and clear, like something seen through an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inverted opera-glass, and all the brief play of desires and</seg><seg type="columnLine">errors that had made his former life. She said little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the emotion in her face followed the tones in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, and it seemed to him he had at last a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding. He reverted from pure reminiscence to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sense of greatness she imposed upon him. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it all, this destiny was before me," he said; "this</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast inheritance of which I did not dream."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Insensibly their heroic preoccupation with the revolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionary struggle passed to the question of their relation-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. He began to question her. She told him of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days before his awakening, spoke with a brief vividness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the girlish dreams that had given a bias to her life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the incredulous emotions his awakening had aroused.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She told him too of a tragic circumstance of her girlhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had darkened her life, quickened her sense of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justice and opened her heart prematurely to the wider</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorrows of the world. For a little time, so far as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned, the great war about them was but the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">ennobling background to these personal things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In an instant these personal relations were submerged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There came messengers to tell that a great fleet of aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes was rushing between the sky and Avignon. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the crystal dial in the corner and assured him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self that the thing was so. He went to the chart room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and consulted a map to measure the distances of Avig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non, New Arawan, and London. He made swift calcu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lations. He went to the room of the Ward Leaders to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask for news of the fight for the stages--and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one there. After a time he came back to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face had changed. It had dawned upon him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the struggle was perhaps more than half over, that Os-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trog was holding his own, that the arrival of the aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes would mean a panic that might leave him help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. A chance phrase in the message had given him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of the reality that came. Each of these soaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">giants bore its thousand half-savage negroes to the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">grapple of the city. Suddenly his humanitarian enthus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iasm showed flimsy. Only two of the Ward Leaders were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their room, when presently he repaired thither; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall of Atlas seemed empty. He fancied a change in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing of the attendants in the outer rooms. A sombre</seg><seg type="columnLine">disillusionment darkened his mind. She looked at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously when he returned to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No news," he said with an assumed carelessness, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then he was moved to frankness. "Or rather--bad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">news. We are losing. We are gaining no ground and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aeroplanes draw nearer and nearer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He walked the length of the room and turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Unless we can capture those flying stages in the next</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hour--there will be horrible things. We shall be beaten."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No!" she said. "We have justice--we have the peo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ple. We have God on our side."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ' Ostrog has discipline--he had plans. Do you know,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out there just now I felt--. When I heard that these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aeroplanes were a stage nearer. I felt as if I were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fighting the machinery of fate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She made no answer for a while. "We have done</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">right," she said at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He looked at her doubtfully. "We have done what we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could. But does this depend upon us? Is it not an older</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sin, a wider sin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What do you mean?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "These blacks are savages, ruled by force, used as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">force. And they have been under the rule of the whites</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two hundred years. Is it not a race quarrel? The race</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sinned--the race pays."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But these laborers, these poor people of London--!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Vicarious atonement. To stand wrong is to share</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the guilt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She looked keenly at him, astonished at the new aspect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he presented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Without came the shrill ringing of a bell, the sound</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of feet and the gabble of a phonographic message. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man in yellow appeared. "Yes?" said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "They are at Vichy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Where are the attendants who were in the great Hall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Atlas?'' asked Graham abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently the Babble Machine rang again. "We may</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">win yet," said the man in yellow, going out to it. "If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only we can find where Ostrog has hidden his guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Everything hangs on that now. Perhaps this--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Graham followed him. But the only news was of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aeroplanes. They had reached Orleans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Graham returned to Helen. "No news," he said. "No</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">news."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And we can do nothing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">HE paced impatiently. Suddenly the swift anger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that was his nature swept over him. "Curse this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">complex world!" he cried, "and all the inventions of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men! That a man must die like a rat in a snare and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">never see his foe! Oh, for one blow! ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">«m?e ,turned with an abrupt change in his manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1 hat s nonsense," he said. "I am a savage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He paced and stopped. "After all, London and Paris</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are only two cities. All the temperate zone has risen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">What if London is doomed and Paris destroyed? These</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are but accidents." Again came the mockery of news to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">call him to fresh enquiries. He returned with a graver</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">face and sat down beside her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The end must be near," he said. "The people it seems</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have fought and died in tens of thousands, the ways</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about Roehampton must be like a smoked beehive. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they have died in vain. They are still only at the sub</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stage. The aeroplanes are near Paris. Even were a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gleam of success to come now, there would be nothing to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">do, there would be no time to do anything before they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were upon us.

Think of the disorder of things!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">think of this foolish tumult, that cannot even find its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weapons! Oh, for one aeropile--just one! For the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">want of that I am beaten. Humanity is beaten and our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cause is lost!

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice changed. "But--. I think--I have been indis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creet. I knew little--I grasped too hastily. ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused. He was ashamed of this avowal. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one thing that makes up for all. I have known you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Across this gulf of time I have come to you.

With you, too, it has been something more--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">something less--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused with his face searching hers, and without</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamored the unheeded message that the aeroplanes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising into the sky of Amiens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She put her hand to her throat, and her lips were white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stared before her as if she saw some horrible pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility. Suddenly her features changed. "Oh, but I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been honest!" she cried, and then, "Have I been honest?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I loved the world and freedom, I hated cruelty and op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression. Surely it was that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he said, "yes. And we have done what it lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in us to do.

She sat in silence. Her face was a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">riddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   For a moment they heeded nothing of a sudden stir</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, a running to and fro, and cries. Then Helen</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to an attitude of tense attention. "It is--," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried and stood up, speechless, incredulous, triumphant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Graham, too, heard. Metallic voices were shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing "Victory!" Yes it was "Victory!" He stood up also</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the light of a desperate hope in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bursting through the curtains appeared the man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow, startled and dishevelled with excitement. "Vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory," he cried, "victory! The people are winning. Os-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trog's people have collapsed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She rose. "Victory?" And her voice was hoarse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?" asked Graham. "Tell me!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have driven them out of the under galleries at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norwood, Streatham is afire and burning wildly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roehampton is ours.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed, and passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shrill bell rang. An agitated grey-headed man ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared from the room of the Ward Leaders. "It is all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over," he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What matters it now that we have Roehampton? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeroplanes have been sighted at Boulogne!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Channel!" said the man in yellow.

"Half an hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They still have three of the flying stages." said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Those guns?" cried Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We cannot mount them--in half an hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Do you mean they are found?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Too late," said the old man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"If we could stop them another hour!" cried the man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in yellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing can stop them now," said the old man. "They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have near a hundred aeroplanes in the first fleet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Another hour?" asked Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"To be so near!" said the Ward Leader. "Now that we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have found those guns. To be so near--.

"Even now--. An</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hour!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He had suddenly perceived a possibility. He tried to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speak calmly, but his face was white. "There is one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chance.

Now and then they spoke to one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. They spoke the mutilated English of their class</seg><seg type="columnLine">and period. The fire of the Ostrogites had dwindled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ceased, and few of the enemy had been seen for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. But the echoes of the fight that was going on now</seg><seg type="columnLine">far below in the lower galleries of that stage, came every</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then between the staccato of shots from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular side. One of these men was describing to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other how he had seen a man down below there dodge</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind a girder, and had aimed at a guess and hit him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cleanly as he dodged too far. "He's down there still,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the marksman. "See that little patch. Yes. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween those bars." A few yards behind them lay a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger, face upward to the sky, with the blue canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his jacket smouldering in a circle about the neat bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let hole on his chest. Close beside him a wounded man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a leg swathed about, sat with an expressionless face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watched the progress of that burning. Gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them, athwart the carrier lay the captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeropile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't see him now," said the second man in a tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">of provocation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The marksman became foul-mouthed and high-voiced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his earnest endeavor to make things plain. And sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, interrupting him, came a noisy shouting from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">substage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's going on now," he said, and raised himself 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">one arm to stare at the stairheads in the central groove</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stage. A number of blue figures were coming up</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, and swarming across the stage to the aeropile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We don't want all these fools," said his friend. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">only crowd up and spoil shots. What are they after?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ssh!--they're shouting something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men listened. The swarming newcomers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded densely about the aeropile. Three Ward Lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">125</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, conspicuous by their black mantles and badges, clam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered into the body and appeared above it. The rank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">file flung themselves upon the vans, gripping hold of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges, until the entire outline of the thing was manned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some places three deep. One of the marksmen knelt</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. "They're putting it on the carrier--that's what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're after."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose to his feet, his friend rose also. "What's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">good?" said his friend. "We've got no aeronauts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's what they're doing anyhow." He looked at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle, looked at the struggling crowd, and suddenly turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lo the wounded man. "Mind these, mate," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">handing his carbine and cartridge belt; and in a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was running towards the aeropile. For a quarter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour he was a perspiring Titan, lugging, thrusting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting and heeding shouts, and then the thing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, and he stood with a multitude of others cheering</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own achievement. By this time he knew, what in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed everyone in the city knew, that the Master, raw</seg><seg type="columnLine">learner though he was, intended to fly this machine him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, was coming even now to take control of it, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">let no other man attempt it. "He who takes the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger, he who bears the heaviest burden, that man is</seg><seg type="columnLine">King," so the Master was reported to have spoken. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as this man cheered, and while the beads of sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">still chased one another from the disorder of his hair, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the thunder of a greater tumult, and in fitful</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatches the beat and impulse of the revolutionary song.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw through a gap in the people that a thick stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heads still poured up the stairway. "The Master is</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming," shouted voices, "the Master is coming." and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd about him grew denser and denser. He began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to thrust himself towards the central groove. "The Mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter is coming!" "The Sleeper, the Master!" "God and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Master!" roared the voices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And suddenly quite close to him were the black uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms of the revolutionary guard, and for the first and</seg><seg type="columnLine">last time in his life he saw Graham, saw him quite clearly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A tall, dark man in a flowing black robe, with a white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolute face and eyes fixed steadfastly before him; a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who for all the little things about him had neither ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor eyes nor thoughts. . . . For all his days that man</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered the passing of Graham's bloodless face. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment it had gone and he was fighting in the swaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd. A lad weeping with terror thrust against him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing toward the stairways, yelling "Clear for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeropile!" The bell that clears the flying stage became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loud unmelodious clanging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that clanging in his ears Graham drew near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeropile, marched into the shadow of its tilting wing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He became aware that a number of people about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">were offering to accompany him, and waved their offers</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside. He wanted to think how one started the engine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bell clanged faster and faster, and the feet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreating people roared faster and louder. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in yellow was assisting him to mount through the ribs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the body. He clambered into the aeronaut's place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixing himself very carefully and deliberately. What was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it? The man in yellow was pointing to two aeropiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving upward in the southern sky. No doubt they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for the coming aeroplanes. That--presently--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing to do now was to start. Things were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted at him. questions, warnings. They bother him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted to think about the aeropile, to recall every</seg><seg type="columnLine">item of his previous experience. He waved the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him, saw the man in yellow dropping off through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ribs, saw the crowd cleft down the line of the girders</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he was motionless, staring at the levers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wheel by which the engine shifted, and all the deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate appliances of which he knew so little. His eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught a spirit level with the bubble towards him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remembered something, spent a dozen seconds in</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging the engine forward until the bubble floated in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the centre of the tube. He noted that the people were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not shouting, knew they watched his deliberation. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bullet smashed on the bar above his head. Who fired?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Was the line clear of people? He stood up to see and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sat down again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">IN another second the propeller was spinning, and he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was rushing down the guides. He gripped the wheel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and swung the engine back to lift the stem. Then it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the people shouted. In a moment he was throbbing with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the quiver of the engine, and the shouts dwindled swiftly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">behind, rushed down to silence. The wind whistled over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the edges of the screen, and the world sank away from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him very swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Throb, throb, throb--throb, throb, throb; up he drove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He fancied himself free of all excitement, felt cool and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deliberate. He lifted the stem still more, opened one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">valve on his left wing and swept round and up. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looked down with a steady head, and up. One of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ostrogite aeropiles was driving across his course, so that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he drove obliquely towards it and would pass below it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at a steep angle. Its little aeronauts were peering down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at him. What did they mean to do? His mind became</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">active. One, he saw held a weapon pointing, seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prepared to fire. What did they think he meant to do? In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a moment he understood their tactics, and his resolution</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was taken. His momentary lethargy was past. He opened</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two more valves to his left, swung round, end on to this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hostile machine, closed his valves, and shot straight at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it, stem and wind-screening shielding him from the shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They tilted a little as if to clear him. He flung up his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Throb, throb, throb--pause--throb, throb--he set his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">teeth, his face into an involuntary grimace, and crash!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He struck itl He struck upward beneath the nearer wing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Very slowly the wing of his antagonist seemed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">broaden as the impetus of his blow turned it up. He saw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the full breadth of it and then it slid downward out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He felt his stem going down, his hands tightened on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the levers, whirled and rammed the engine back. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">felt the jerk of a clearance, the nose of the machine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jerked up steeply, and for a moment he seemed to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lying on his back. The machine was reeling and stag-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The destruction of the aeropile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">120</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gering, it seemed to be dancing on its screw. He made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge effort, hung for a moment on the levers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly the engine came forward again. He was driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward but no longer so steeply. He gasped for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and flung himself at the levers again. The wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistled about him. One further effort and he was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most level. He could breathe. He turned his head for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time to see what had become of his antagonists.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turned back to the levers for a moment and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. For a moment he could have believed they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">annihilated. And then he saw between the two stages</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the east was a chasm, and down this something, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender edge, fell swiftly and vanished, as a sixpence falls</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a crack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first he did not understand, and then a wild joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed him. He shouted at the top of his voice, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inarticulate shout, and drove higher and higher up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. Throb, throb, throb, pause, throb, throb, throb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where was the other aeropile?" he thought. "They,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too--." As he looked round the empty heavens he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a momentary fear that this machine had risen above him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he saw it alighting on the Norwood stage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had meant shooting. To risk being rammed head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long two thousand feet in the air was beyond their</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter-day courage. The combat was declined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a little while he circled, then swooped in a steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent towards the westward stage. Throb, throb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throb, throb, throb, throb. The twilight was creeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">on apace, the smoke from the Streatham stage that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so dense and dark, was now a pillar of fire, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laced curves of the moving ways and the translucent</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms and domes and the chasms between the buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">were glowing softly now, lit by the tempered radiance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the electric light that the glare of the day overpowered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The three efficient stages that the Ostrogites held--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wimbledon Park was useless because of the fire from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roehampton, and Streatham was a furnace--were glow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with guide lights for the coming aeroplanes. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept over the Roehampton stage he saw the dark masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the people thereon. He heard a clap of frantic cheer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, heard a bullet from the Wimbledon Park stage tweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air, and went beating up above the Surrey</seg><seg type="columnLine">wastes. He felt a breath of wind from the south-west,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lifted his westward wing as he had learned to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so drove upward heeling into the rare swift upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. Throb, throb, throb--throb, throb, throb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up he drove and up, to that pulsating rhythm, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country beneath was blue and indistinct, and London</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread like a little map traced in light, like the mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">model of a city near the brim of the horizon. The south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">west was a sky of sapphire over the shadowy rim of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, and ever as he drove upwards the multitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars increased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And behold! In the southward, low down and glitter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing swiftly nearer, were two little patches of nebulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. And then two more, and then a nebulous glow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly driving shapes. Presently he could count them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were four and twenty. The first fleet of aeroplanes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come! Beyond appeared a yet greater glow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swept round in a half circle, staring at this ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vancing fleet. It flew in a wedge-like shape, a triangular</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight of gigantic phosphorescent shapes sweeping nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the lower air. He made a swift calculation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their pace, and spun the little wheel that brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sngine forward. He touched a lever and the throbbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">affort of the engine ceased. He began to fall, fell swifter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swifter. He aimed at the apex of the wedge. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped like a stone through the whistling air. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarce a second from that soaring moment before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the foremost aeroplane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No man of all that black multitude saw the coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his fate, no man among them dreamt of the hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">that struck downward upon him out of the sky. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were not limp in the agonies of air-sickness, were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">craning their black necks and staring to see the filmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">city that was rising out of the haze, the rich and splendid</seg><seg type="columnLine">city to which "Massa Boss" had brought their obedient</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles. Bright teeth gleamed and the glossy faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone. They had heard of Paris. They knew they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have lordly times among the "poor white" trash. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly Graham struck them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had aimed at the body of the aeroplane, but at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very last instant a better idea had flashed into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. He twisted about and struck near the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the starboard wing with all his accumulated weight. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was jerked back as he struck. His prow went gliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">across its smooth expanse towards the rim. He felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward rush of the huge fabric sweeping him and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeropile along with it, and for a moment that seemed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">age he could not tell what was happening. He heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand throats yelling, and perceived that his machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was balanced on the edge of the gigantic float, and driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, down; glanced over his shoulder and saw the back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone of the aeroplane and the opposite float swaying up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a vision through the ribs of sliding chairs, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces, and hands clutching at the tilting guide bars. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fenestrations in the further float flashed open as the aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naut tried to right her. Beyond he saw a second aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane leaping steeply to escape the whirl of its heeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow. The broad area of swaying wings seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerk upward. He felt his aeropile had dropped clear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the monstrous fabric, clean overturned, hung like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloping wall above him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not clearly understand that he had struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side float of the aeroplane and slipped off, but he per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived that he was flying free on the down glide and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly nearing earth. What had he done? His heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbed like a noisy engine in this throat and for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perilous instant he could not move his levers because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paralysis of his hands. He wrenched the levers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw his engine back, fought for two seconds against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of it, felt himself righting, driving horizontally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">set the engine beating again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE looked upward and saw two aeroplanes glide shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing far overhead, looked back, and saw the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of the fleet opening out and rushing upward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward; saw the one he had struck fall edgewise on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strike like a gigantic knife-blade along the wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels below it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put down his stern and looked again. He drove up</seg><seg type="columnLine">heedless of his direction as he watched. He saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-vanes give, saw the huge fabric strike the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw its downward vans crumple with the weight of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent, and then the whole mass turned over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed upside down, upon the sloping wheels. Throb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throb, throb, pause. Suddenly from the heaving wreck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age a thin tongue of white fire licked up toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zenith. And then he was aware of a huge mass flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air towards him, and turned upwards just</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time to escape the charge--if it was a charge--of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second aeroplane. It whirled by below, sucked him down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fathom, and nearly turned him over in the gust of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">close passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He became aware of three others rushing towards him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of the urgent necessity of beating above them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aeroplanes were all about him, circling wildly to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, as it seemed.

Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the southward a second squadron was coming. Stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily he beat upward. Presently all the aeroplanes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">below him, but for a moment he doubted the height he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had of them, and did not swoop again. And then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down upon a second victim and all its load of</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers saw him coming.

The louder noises</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the day had ceased, and with the gradual</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering forth of the myriad lights with which, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewels, the fair queen was wont to adorn herself for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening at home--a sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of calm security warmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hearts of old and young</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike.

His keen ears had caught a word in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">howling clamor of the newsboys and then with all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heightened sensibilities alert he had heard enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause him to do a thing which for him had become quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncommon--to buy a paper. He had fairly snatched it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a boy who was running past, had cast a quarter in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his direction and turned to a lighted window to scan</seg><seg type="columnLine">the headlines with an evident excitement. The boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">.'ooked several times at the quarter he had received,</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to speak once or twice, but then seeing that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">customer seemed satisfied, raced on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then with scarcely a glance about Dr. Grieg hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">on into the darker streets toward the edge of the city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he might have been followed far into the night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking, walking on and on with the apparent aimless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of one who has a deal of time to spend and does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not find the pastime disagreeable. And yet, if his</seg><seg type="columnLine">course was aimless, no one would have described his</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical appearance in such terms. First, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands deep in his pockets, he hurried along as if in</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste from some dreaded pursuer. Then, and apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any forethought, he stopped under a lamp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled out his lately acquired paper, read and re-read</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in it, and finally with all the appearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who enjoys the contemplation of a master joke that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has engineered, he thrust it once more deep within</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket, seized his coat by the lapels, pulled himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and chuckled,--actually chuckled, though a careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">examination of another paper identical with the one he</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried, failed to reveal the slightest cause for such</seg><seg type="columnLine">behavior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then slowly he wandered on through the higher resi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence portions of the city, occasionally whistling in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rambling way,--aimlessly it seemed, even like his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandering. But the frequent repetition of a few notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested the unconscious echoing of some song of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. They were, however, unheeded by the few who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still awake, save one, an old night watchman, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom the peculiar strains had suddenly awakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange memories. He seemed to be once more leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the little window in his father's house in a land</seg><seg type="columnLine">once dear to him, but which he had come to regard as</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer first in his affections, now that he was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">American. With each repetition of those haunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">strains he could almost hear the tramp, tramp of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gay Studenten as they sang late into the night. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no mistaking it, and for the first time in a score</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years the words came back to him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        "Alt Heidelberg, du feine,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         Du Stadt an Ehren reich,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       Am Neckar und am Rheine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        Keine andre kommet dir gleich."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No mistake! Old Heidelberg; even the lilt at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each line had been common to the students in old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heidelberg.

Early he had been sent to both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Realschule and the Gymnasium, and later by some for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten bit of fortune had been able to go to Heidelberg,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonn and Berlin. Here he had studied under some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest of living scientists, Helmholtz among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest, and he had not only shown unusual ability in mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering the deep mysteries of chemistry and physics, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">had on several occasions given evidence of the possession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of no common power of insight into natural phenomena.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deep electrical problems had been his chief delight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was even suggested that had he cared for notoriety</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might have anticipated the great Heinrich Hertz in</seg><seg type="columnLine">announcing some of the facts which the latter discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning electromagnetic waves. In 1893 and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">years following, he had been back and forth between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris and some of the German universities where was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on the feverish work immediately preceding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world-stirring announcements of Becquerel and Roent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gen. He had followed closely some of the earliest work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Curies in their epoch-making isolation of radio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">active substances, and, at the time (1896-7) when Perrin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was trying to generate electric currents by mean1- of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Roentgen rays. Dr. Grieg was not only f'equently</seg><seg type="columnLine">in London attending meetings of the English icientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">societies, but had given a series of lectures before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philosophical Society of Cambridge on the "Electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nature of Matter." These papers, preserved in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">transactions of the society, show now perhaps more</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly than they did then the wonderful perspicacity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man. In a manner worthy of Faraday or Maxwell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had predicted certain phenomena--or their absence--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be upheld by the work of other investigators a decade</seg><seg type="columnLine">later. Especially had he been intere.-ted in all electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments conducted in a vacuum, as he was watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">for every possible verification of his early theory that</seg><seg type="columnLine">an/ form of matter in a sufficiently divided elementary</seg><seg type="columnLine">form--atoms or their subdivisions--m'ght be trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported by electrical forces, like the ray particles investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gated by Becquerel and Crookes. Though this sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion seemed radically visionary the experience of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific world between 1895 and 1900 had taught it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reserve judgment. Only after a certain familiarity</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the newer rays and radiations had been acquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">did men of science once more venture to make dogmatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">statements relative to possible natural phenomena. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had condemned Grieg as a notoriety seeker, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">owing to the fact that at that time he was not holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">any high academic position, he had little recourse in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his adversity. But his resolve to prove his point doubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that time on. It became the dominating passion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his life to show that his critics were wrong. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">strengthen his own conviction further work was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary. He would yet demonstrate to the world a</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformation more wonderful than any for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the philosopher's stone had ever been sought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it was about 1902, that he turned to America.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurt but far from crushed, he resolved to leave the blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaders of the old world, and come to the land of golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity. As his controversies in Europe had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely over matters of opinion, his distinction in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">country was scarcely, if at all, diminished, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately offered a chair of electrochemistry in several</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the eastern universities. But after a few special lec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures before some of the scientific societies in the eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN VAPOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">states, he continued his journey westward, finally to</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle down in the sunkist city of San Francisco. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">the western spirit of youthful enthusiasm inspired him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as nothing else had since his student days in Bonn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He found everyone ready to accept a newcomer at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent worth with no questions about the past, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">requiring no promise for the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He now rented a few rooms, gathered his books about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and began a period of study and experimentation</seg><seg type="columnLine">more intense, if possible, than any of his earlier years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aside from the postman with his armful of scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">journals and letters from foreign savants he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors; no one knew anything of his order of life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Days and nights lost all distinction for him. Rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">came only when sorely needed and with no relation what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever to the time of day or the custom of those about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He lived as in a prison, glad that its doors locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the entire world of possible disturbers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the years that followed Dr. Grieg gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally felt his way along the path of which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed while yet a student. Every fact, every relation</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the phenomena of molecular physics, brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him nearer his desired goal. While a mere boy he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">read with wild interest of the ancient experiments in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which water inclosed in gold and silver spheres had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been made to actually pass through the pores of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal when subjected to sufficient pressure. Why might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the same thing be accomplished by some other force</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a mechanical one,--by an electric or a magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, for instance? He had also followed the well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known experiments on the diffusion of metals, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">molecules of gold and lead had mixed when blocks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pure substances had been kept in close contact for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time. Here the materials, in small portions to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure, had migrated under some influence broadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">classified under molecular forces. Were these too not</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical? Could they not be controlled artificially?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then later there were the remarkable experiments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bridgman, in this country, and Adams and others in</seg><seg type="columnLine">England, which had shown that the ordinary characteriz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing properties of all substances disappear or change</seg><seg type="columnLine">radically when suitable forces are applied to them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen the rock specimens produced by Adams, prov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that solid, cold granite could be made to change its</seg><seg type="columnLine">form and flow by the mere application of sufficient pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. He had studied Bridgman's data showing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquids may behave as solids, and vice versa, if con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fined and subjected to forces of great enough magni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude. And many of their other physical properties were</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed to such an extent as to afford a new field of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of this came to Grieg as welcome support for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">theories. Each discovery by another enabled him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorten his own methods for arriving at his goal. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalled the famous experiments on electricity and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, by Sir Oliver Lodge and others, and the later</seg><seg type="columnLine">theories about electrons filled him with ecstasies of joy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other investigators as well as himself were finding out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that atoms of matter when in vibration at a sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">high rate, had some effect on the ether of space; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually sent out waves, and in some cases they them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves disappeared as if borne away on the rays of</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy they had emitted--radiations actually affecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain electrical instruments. Soon it was found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">as these electrical properties of matter were made to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease many of the other ordinary "substance" character-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istics diminished or disappeared entirely. The identity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some of the "rays" from radio-active substances and</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms of helium had long been suspected, and it only</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained to produce such a separation and transfer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter artificially to overcome the great difficulty which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was temporarily threatening all of Dr. Grieg's hopes. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">must make atoms,--atoms of helium, for instance, do</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the things that the alpha-particles of radium</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been shown to do. Perhaps it might be possible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do even more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the experimental details involved in this attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">little can be told. Naturally the apparatus used was</seg><seg type="columnLine">complex and delicate. Dr. Grieg's rooms had gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken on the confused appearance of living room, library</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laboratory. In the larger room of the three which</seg><seg type="columnLine">now constituted this "little kingdom," was a long table</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered high with a mysterious conglomeration of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struments, glass tubes, bulbs of quartz and other sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances, an electrically driven vacuum pump, and a Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leod gage for showing the exact degree of vacuum</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained. There were also wires, switches, rheostats</seg><seg type="columnLine">and electrical meters in great numbers, a hopeless mix-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the uninitiated, but to the master--to Grieg--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">was undoubtedly in precise order, in pleasingly fine ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justment--a thing alive, a creature of promise!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of this mass of equipment several portions were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spicuous beyond the rest. Mounted near the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table was a semi-transparent globe, apparently of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass and tinted faintly to a lemon-yellow color. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, it was joined by a tube to the gage and pump, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">below it tapered to a neck provided with a glass stop-cock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On opposite sides entered two wires which seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">terminate in small concave metal reflectors not unlike the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cathodes in early forms of X-ray tubes. These two were</seg><seg type="columnLine">identical and seemed as if curved to focus at a common</seg><seg type="columnLine">point midway between them. A close observer would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have noticed at this foca. point a small bright metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">bead, mounted on the end of a fine wire coming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">another electrode in the rear wall of the bulb. Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ternally, these were all connected by wires to the elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical instruments with which the table and the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath it was largely filled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not far away was a second bulb of about the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">size as the former, but containing a large concave mirror</seg><seg type="columnLine">of very peculiar appearance. At first sight it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been taken for metal, like the smaller ones, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer inspection showed it to be at the same time some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what of a glassy nature, almost transparent when viewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly from in front. At its focus were the ends of</seg><seg type="columnLine">several tirty wires bearing small frames at once sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive of the grid arrangement in some of the vacuum de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tectors used in wireless telegraphy. This bulb was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected to the air pump, but apparently sealed perma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nently, and supported in such a manner that it could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotated to face in any direction. Dr. Grieg called the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter bulb the Mcdior, and the other one the Material-</seg><seg type="columnLine">izer. In them lay the secret of his entire work, the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult of his years of study, and they were at one and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time weapons and tools for possible good of</seg><seg type="columnLine">previously undreamed of potency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long ago he had seen enough of the realization of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams to work on in feverish haste. Although a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought would have shown that his secret was safe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even had his rooms been open to every one, he lived in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a constant tremor of fear, lest his new-found power</seg><seg type="columnLine">should slip into the hands of others. Calmly thoughtful</seg><seg type="columnLine">by nature, he at times lost all self-control at the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of an outsider within his sanctum. And this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear grew day by day until reasons began to formulate</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves in his mind for leaving the house he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to regard almost as his own, and find other quarters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where there might be no curious landlady, where walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not so thin, where fire risk would be less, facilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">better, and so on, until, as he surveyed the array he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly that there was no course left him but to move,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sooner the better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it came about that before long a dray load of huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes and crates was moved into one of the rear rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the second floor of a down-town office building. Grieg</seg><seg type="columnLine">130</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had reasoned rightly, that seclusion was more certain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart of the city than where people's thoughts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">less occupied. Here he had a spacious room, only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sure, and one having but two windows high up so</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to afford only a view of a few square feet of brick</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall a few feet away. But these and other factors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">great sources of gratification to the new occupant, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the least of the several reasons for this was that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent was far lower than it would have been for any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar space. And the walls were of solid brick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">masonry, two feet thick if an inch.--and the floor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of concrete. What more could he wish for? Greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">security and isolation could scarcely have been provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a lonely island in Polynesia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now it was that the work began in earnest. Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grieg had some months earlier succeeded in transmitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">helium from one bulb to another several feet distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of his electrical rays. And the method had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been surprisingly simple after all of the superfluous de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails in the apparatus had been eliminated. At first the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flask containing the helium had been placed in the path</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a powerful beam of ultra-violet rays and the Medior</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulb immediately in front of it in the same rays. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the proper pressures were obtained in the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">containers, he had succeeded in showing by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spectroscope that the space within the Medior con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained a small percentage of helium, whereas before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposure it had contained absolutely none.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From that time on the developments were of the nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of slight adjustments and improvements rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">fundamental inventions. He now had the embryo of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creation which he fully believed could be made to grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">to almost any proportions if properly studied and as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted. Before his mind's eye lay a changing universe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its laws upset, and all human notions of its stability and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixity set at naught. If helium, for example, could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus called by him from one closed vessel and made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear within another, when there was no apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical connection or functioning medium between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, why might not his command be extended to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">other elements as well?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' One evening while sitting far into the night and gaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at his beloved bulbs as he had often done before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now as one hypnotized and immovable for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in many hours, he gradually lost all sense of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and space in contemplating a widening vision that built</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself up and up before him. His cheeks became flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">'and an unwonted fire glowed in the depths of his half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed eyes and, drunk with the dream as well as ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted, he fell asleep and dreamed on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hour after hour his little clock ticked away the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds and the little motor that drove the air-pump purred</seg><seg type="columnLine">on so contentedly that one would scarcely have dreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that its song was one of ceaseless labor and faithfulness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps it knew the importance of its task, and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall say that the little old clock did not philosophize</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply before ticking off another second, knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no power could bring it back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Grieg awoke. He seemed at first startled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if surprised in some secret business, and then recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nizing his whereabouts, he almost laughed aloud. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly he would have done so had not his habit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrecy and quietness become quite fixed. But he did laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little, and for a long time, as he walked about the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hands behind his back, he seemed to be review-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing some pleasant scene. He would stop occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caress some queer-looking piece of apparatus, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps he would speak to some other mysterious con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trivance, all the time with the bearing of one who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">both a general marshalling his troops for a glorious as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sault and a dear friend. His brief ejaculations were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nature of assurances, of promises, of congratulations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night, or rather morning, Grieg thought no more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of sleep. For a time he pored over the books which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scattered about the room,--the most of them open</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some reference of immediate interest. Then he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">newed his experimental work. For days he scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to pause for a moment. When or where he ate</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not known. Had he not actually slept amid his ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus on that other night he might have been credited</seg><seg type="columnLine">with perpetual sleeplessness, among his other powers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But through it all, something seemed to buoy him up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to renew his vigor and instill youth into his veins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It has long been known that when under the influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the force of electric currents of sufficiently high fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quencies and high potentials, practically all substances</seg><seg type="columnLine">act as conductors. This fact had been made use of by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grieg in making the Medior. Now he constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange transformers for increasing these qualities as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as possible. Huge coils, like those of Telsa and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oudin, were built into the apparatus already filling a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large portion of the room. Devices for producing ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet light in powerful beams were added, and mercury</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor lamps replaced the ordinary electric lamps in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling. This was because he had always found his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periments to succeed best in the presence of these radia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of short wavelength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such was his success that he was soon able to transfer</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the heavier gases from one bulb to another, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had first done with the helium. Then came metal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic vapors, the lighter ones first, and finally that of mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cury,--all of course, initially inclosed in a sealed bulb</seg><seg type="columnLine">free from the presence of other substances and made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reappear in the Medior. But the latter, for the reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had led him to so name it, was never intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the final receiver; it was to be but the medium, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agency to affect the transformation of what it received</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an ether wave energy form to that of a particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric current. This, in turn, was to be further trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed into its characteristic matter form by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Materializer. However, the difficulties involved when</seg><seg type="columnLine">this step was attempted under any but ideal conditions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made the Materializer hitherto of little more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">theoretical usefulness. And then in a brief moment he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that the interposition of suitable condensers be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the two bulbs solved the problem completely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When in operation the faintly luminous rays in the Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terializer brought the tiny metallic bead to a bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">incandescence, and a vapor soon appeared around it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">condensing and forming on the sides of the bulb as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">impalpable powder or sometimes as a liquid, which could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be drawn off by means of the stop-cock below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The principal steps in the process were as follows:</seg><seg type="columnLine">A bulb containing, say mercury vapor, was set in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path of a beam of ultra-violet light which in turn also</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed to the Medior, though the latter was possibly some</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet away. (Absorption of these radiations by the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other media had been obviated by giving the waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves a suitable form.) The grid in the Medior</seg><seg type="columnLine">was then heated by an auxiliary electric current from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small storage battery, and the entire bulb was oriented</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that its concave mirror faced the beam of ultra-violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays. Then the high-frequency, high-potential apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">was started and as soon as the condensers were adjusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the proper capacities, the tiny sphere at the focus of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mirrors of the Materializer would begin to glow,--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish vapor would surround it and soon minute globules</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metallic mercury would begin to roll down the sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bulb and could be drawn into a beaker below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, some limitations still remained that he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be removed before his great dream could be en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely realized. Among them was the fact that the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance to be transferred by this method must begin its</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformation in a hermetically sealed flask, entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">freed from the presence of even the slightest trace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other substance. Then again, he had been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN VAPOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">make the transfer only when the active beam of ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet rays was approximately at right angles to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the earth's gravitational force. On this lat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter subject he had thought almost constantly, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">even written a lengthy paper--"On the Relation of Elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronic Path to the Direction of the Gravitational Vector"</seg><seg type="columnLine">--with the notion of reading it at the approaching meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the American Physical Society in San Francisco.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the first thought of his earlier treatment at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of those other scientific societies in Europe caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to tear it up and burn the strips slowly over a Bun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sen burner, smiling as he watched the glow of the ink</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the falling flakes of ash, as if the joke were on others</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not on himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The work of Mosely, the Braggs and others opened up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new avenue for attacking the problem which now ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded all other thoughts. It had been found that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">X-rays excite secondary X-rays by the molecular agita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the substances through which they pass, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these new rays possess characteristics relating</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to the emitting substances. Their directions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">also different from those of the primary rays which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited them, so that they seemed at first to be only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same radiations after reflection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beginning with these facts Grieg was soon able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverse the action of his Materializer and Medior so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a vapor or finely divided solid which had been in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted into the former might be de-materialized and</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitted to a distant place, and there re-materialized</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the same sort of apparatus used as a receiver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came another great discovery. If the flask</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was to act as the receiver already contained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance in a similar form (that is, solid or vapor) to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the substance in the transmitting bulb, but of greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">molecular weight, the mere impinging of the charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet rays on this substance set up molecular agitations</seg><seg type="columnLine">resulting not only in the automatic materialization of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the substance sought, but also in the emission of sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ondary rays in exactly the opposite direction, and these</seg><seg type="columnLine">in turn bore back in pure energy form, portions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">denser material. Thus a single transmitter became both</seg><seg type="columnLine">a de-materializer and a materializer, a sender and a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiver!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The experiment was tried out repeatedly. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">example, equal masses of tin and lead had thus been</seg><seg type="columnLine">exchanged, and the only characteristic difference in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of the sending bulb was that while acting at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time as a receiver, its vapors were in violent</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumult. This motion ceased only when one or both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the substances had been completely transferred. Still</seg><seg type="columnLine">further refinements had then enabled Grieg to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exchange in any direction and thus the gravitational</seg><seg type="columnLine">factor which had long been a stumbling block was</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following this last success and for the first time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, he seemed to move leisurely. Deliberately he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would wander about his room with the air of one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows that his plans have not miscarried, and who sees</seg><seg type="columnLine">his final triumph easily within his reach. The battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was won; he had but to accept the victory! The fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was meditating on what society would call a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave crime, scarcely entered his mind. When it did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">only smiled cynically, as always, in the consciousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own security. Though he should not be classed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a moral pervert, or one naturally bad, he was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps now little better, for he had lost all of his former</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of moral and social responsibility. Human laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">and customs mattered to him not at all. The experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be tried come what might. It would in itself be</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life's triumph, his triumph over his old critics, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supreme proof of the fallacy of human notions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">security. And of the more material reward which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompany it, well, that was secondary; but after all it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would be pleasant to rest and in what way more enjoy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably than to wander leisurely up and down the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">and breadth of his native Alsace-Lorraine and visit again</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scenes of his student days--when the means were</seg><seg type="columnLine">available?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">* * #</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THUS the days went by. The first day of November</seg><seg type="columnLine">had arrived and nearly passed. Grieg, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just eaten a good meal at a nearby restaurant, was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolling aimlessly along the streets and thinking for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part of mere trivialities, but never for one mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment losing sight of the fact that tonight he was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry out an experiment more wonderful than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed of by the alchemists. Tonight should witness</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enterprise that would at once distance all other human</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavors and baffle the keenest of sleuths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a distant clock chimed the hour of nine, he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to his room. At once his step took on the alertness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one who has made a decision. There was work to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done and done now. Once more he was the keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific investigator. Every sensibility was alert, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the training of a lifetime showed itself in every move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On entering his room he switched on a small, blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, glanced around and at once seated himself before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apparatus on the huge table in the center. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pump had been running uninterruptedly for days and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gage showed that every joint was tight. A tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot light here and there told that all wires were intact</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ready for their task. In place of the single Material-</seg><seg type="columnLine">izer bulb that had been seen previously, there was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">a row of such bulbs, six of them, each larger than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original one, and they were all connected to the pump</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so arranged that each could be switched into cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuit instantaneously. Above them was a large glass fun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel or hopper filled with a bluish-gray metallic appearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder. From this ran a large tube which in turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">branched out so as to enter the top of each of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Materializer bulbs, and admit the powder to any one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on opening the proper stopcock. Beneath each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these bulbs was the usual large beaker. No receiver was</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible. It had ceased to be necessary soon after Grieg</seg><seg type="columnLine">had succeeded in using the secondary radiations as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning agency. Evidently the experiment was to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">some form not hitherto seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a last glance over the apparatus, he slowly closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the master switch which made the whole assembly of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism become a thing of potentialities. Then one</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one, smaller switches were also closed, until from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight hum and glow of the various contrivances one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would judge that all was in working order, set for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack, whatever it might be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly Grieg turned the great Medior bulb first one</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and then another and finally he clamped it pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly downwards. After opening one of the inlet cocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">so as to let a little of the gray powder filter down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first Materializer, he watched it intently for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. The focus glowed and then the usual vapors ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, velvety and blue and hovering quiescent like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit soon to vanish. Then he examined the luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">region with a spectroscope, but soon he set it aside, shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head in a worried manner, and directed his atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion once more to the powerful Medior. Apparently some</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjustment was incomplete. Beginning as before, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung the great globe one way and another as one might</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide a searchlight in exploring a distant hillside. Always</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept it pointing in a general dowmvard direction, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Medior rays played upon some iron bars, and always</seg><seg type="columnLine">he watched the glowing haze in the Materializer. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to time it seemed to show slight tremors, but noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the violent nature he was seeking. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">132</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">swung it through a wider angle sweeping out larger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger circles with its axis, and all the while watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently the tell-tale glow at his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he stopped. For a moment he seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one stupefied. The iron bars on which the downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays were playing slowly seemed to "dematerialize," nay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanish into the thin air! Then he leaped to the spectro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope, directed it toward the boiling vapors in the globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him, and sat for a time as if hypnotized--held by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some strange sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As soon as he moved slightly, it was apparent that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his excitement was very high. His breathing came short</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fast. And then with what seemed almost a shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, he sank back in his chair, buried his face in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands, and remained silent for a long time. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">again he looked up, his eyes and hands were wet. New</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines in his face told how great had been his recent</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Like one who has climbed long and laboriously to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach some far height, and who sighs almost in dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment when he realizes that no higher levels exist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grieg sat and gazed blankly before him rapt by vistas</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching far beyond his laboratory walls. Pleasant lands</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out before him, through which came many roads</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with all manner of travelers. They were bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribute to him. It was a golden view, rich in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth of a bluish golden light that filled the dome of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky above and seemed to hover like a gilded cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his fair mountain. And from all around arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hum of a teeming civilization--the droning tone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a busy world--the monotone of existence itself. But no,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was only the purr of his faithful little motor, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzing and hissing of a myriad tiny sparks that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped his dream. And the glow was still confined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fragile bulbs before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Shaking off his stupor, he turned once more to examine</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Slowly their vapors were condensing in a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder about the sides and bottom of the sphere. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the bottom stop-cock and caught a little of it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a watch glass, rubbed a bit of it between his fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held it near a light. IT was distinctly yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low! And the clouds within his bulbs were still seeth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing violently. . . .	THE END.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    It was on the fourth of December when next Grieg</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was seen--on that night when the crowds had been hur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rying homeward and when the newsboys had been calling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out their wares with such uncommon vigor. In the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">private office of the bank occupying the first floor of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the building in which Grieg had worked so long, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">directors and officers sat solemnly listening to a dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tinguished looking man, evidently their president. Ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">citement, worry and suspicion were written on the face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of everyone present, and it was all on account of a brief</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">telegram that had been received that day from China.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Though it concerned a loss that would be considerable,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still worse was the fact that its information had leaked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out and might alarm the depositors. On the table about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which these men were gathered lay a copy of the evening</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">paper, scarcely an hour from the press, but by now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">widely scattered in all parts of the city. Under glaring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">headlines on the first page was the following:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GOLD SENT, IRON ARRIVES</seg><seg type="columnLine">Contents of $100,000 Box Mysteriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">Changes on Way to China</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      San Francisco, Dec. 4.--A box containing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    $100,000 in gold coin shipped by the Anglo and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    London-Paris National Bank of San Francisco</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    on the liner Korea Mam was found to contain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    only iron when opened by the consignee in Hong</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Kong, according to advices received by the bank</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    and steamship company today.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      The box had been strongly guarded since it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    was first filled in the vaults of the San Francisco</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    bank under the close inspection of several of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    bank officials themselves.

Despite his dark skin and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange white headdress, he seemed more like a brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me than did my fellow-students from my home town</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Iowa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore the incident in the library came as a severe</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock to me; a shock both because of my affection for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend, and because of the startling difference in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">workings of the foreign mind from our own American</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas. Raputra had been standing near the door, talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a short, heavy-set man with a red face and a plateau</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">i'll get you somehow ..." my thoughts began, and sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly stopped. Right before my eyes he dropped liko a^</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughtered ox.

Though not personally acquainted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, I knew who he was: Schleicher, a graduate of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">University of Heidelberg in Germany, and doing post-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graduate work in physiological chemistry at the Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versity of Chicago. What little I knew of him was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">savory; he had a reputation of being personally difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get along with. Right now he seemed to be living</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to that reputation. Though I could not hear any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that was said, the sneering expression and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemptuous snarls of the man were irritating even to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a disinterested spectator at a distance. Suddenly Ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">putra drew himself up to the full height of his tall figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deliberately slapped the German across the mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sharp sound of it made me sit upright in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. The white mark of the Hindu's fingers showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the red of Schleicher's face, which grew redder</seg><seg type="columnLine">until his downy mustache stood out white against it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He kept puffing up till I was afraid he might explode.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he was nearly purple, he caught himself up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gulp; his lower jaw worked up and down and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumbled in his vest pocket. He drew out a card, handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to my friend, turned on his heel, and walked away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had read enough about duelling customs in German uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versities to know what that meant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raputra turned and looked at me. His face was calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I came toward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Peters," he said evenly, "will you assist me in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stood for a moment not knowing what to say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I might endure personal insult," he explained, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">no Indian gentleman will listen to national calumny."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave me the German's card and walked out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was only one other student in the library.

"As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I understand it, these birds want a duel.

I drew my chair up to his. "Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">have them fight a modern, scientific duel. Science for</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons! The real fight will be a battle of wits to</seg><seg type="columnLine">devise a secret, silent blow. The victims will not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">when or how it is to fall. The one who deals it will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be on the scene to be connected with it. To the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will seem like a natural death or an accident."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sounds all right," Jerry Stoner laughed skeptically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I doubt if they can hurt each other much, if they stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rules of that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's what we want, isn't it? Both are well equipped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for such a contest. It will keep them busy for a while.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, in the press of daily work, they will forget it. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't imagine any man, who is really busy, letting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little falling-out like this upset him for very long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raputra Avedian was delighted with the plan when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlined it to him. Something about the subtlety of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">appealed to his Oriental mind and it also satisfied his</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific nature. He thanked me as profusely as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had done him a tremendous favor, and for some days</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterwards was silent and happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was missing all of one night and I became wor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried lest he had met with some disaster; but he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the morning, grimy and fatigued as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been at some sort of hard labor, but he seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful and enthusiastic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed to be taking something very seriously; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I forebore questioning him about it. I could see that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not neglecting the defensive, although I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what his plan of attack was. He assembled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket first-aid kit containing all manner of emergencj</seg><seg type="columnLine">measures, antidotes, stimulants, antitoxins, stomach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pump, purgatives, and emetics. He ate only at the Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mons, of the same food with hundreds of other students,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and never went anywhere but to his laboratory and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our room at the dormitory, always within view of numer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous people and always watching about himself carefully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was as unapproachable as a royal personage. I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded his danger as an exaggerated fancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blow came all the more, therefore, as a shocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise. The suddenness of it, the mystery of it, left</seg><seg type="columnLine">me stunned and paralyzed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE Sunday morning I remained in bed for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes after Raputra had risen and gone into</seg><seg type="columnLine">our little bathroom. I could hear him stropping his</seg><seg type="columnLine">razor and washing his face. Then there was a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">thud and a rapid knocking which gradually died down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I leaped up and ran in. Raputra lay on the floor, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving feebly, but already stiffening in death. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">got his emergency kit open and one hand jerked it about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spilling the contents about the room. It jerked back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth feebly once, and then he lay still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I grew so suddenly weak that I had to sit down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor for a moment be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore I could look around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I searched carefully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nowhere on Raputra or</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the room were therfr</seg><seg type="columnLine">any signs of violence or ot</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything unusual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How had it happened?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wonder of it oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied my mind for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment then I caught sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wet toothbrush at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foot of the lavatory;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pitiful little subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me that my friend had been stricken while brushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his teeth, and a rush of grief drove all the detective im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulses out of my mind. Poor Raputra! All his brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire and his vast promise were nothing now!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again my mind returned to the mystery. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">window in the room was closed and locked on the inside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outside, five stories of smooth, gray brick wall stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the ground, with a feeble wisp of ivy here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. There was no exit save through our sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">room; this had one door into the corridor, locked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inside. No one could have gotten in or out unob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served. What a foolish idea! Of course no one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten in or out. This was the secret, scientific death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Schleicher had done it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All at once it came to me that a sudden death of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort would have to come before a coroner's jury. I de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   OVR author, who is also a practicing physi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       cian, is well known to readers of Amazing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       Stories. Here Dr. Brener has given us a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       most astonishing story with an entirely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       novel theme and a surprising ending,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       throivn in for good measure. We promise</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       you an interesting twenty minutes with this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN VAPOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">135</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tided that I had better leave everything undisturbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more skilled investigators than I was. I called the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I will not go into detail about the miserable days</seg><seg type="columnLine">that followed. The post-mortem examination that took</seg><seg type="columnLine">two doctors and two assistants six hours, the analyses</seg><seg type="columnLine">for poisons, the minute study of our room and bathroom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minute questioning and requestioning of myself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all persons in our end of the dormitory, failed to reveal</seg><seg type="columnLine">the least suggestion of a possible cause of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a sign, not a clue, not a mark!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It looked as though he had been struck dead by magic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the case promised to remain a medical mystery. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">less a personage than Doctor Victor LeCount was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volved in the investigation. This man, the author of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">book on sudden death and its causes, and the world's</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost authority on that subject, had been retained</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the insurance company in which Raputra had recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken a policy; for the presence of the emergency kit</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stirred the company's suspicions. However, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">this great man could offer no suggestions. So, the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">certificate was made out as "sudden death, cause un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known," a burial permit issued, and the insurance paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Raputra's brother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, Jerry Stoner and I had kept quiet in regard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the duel. My first impulse was to stand up and accuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schleicher. But reflection quickly showed me that such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a course would not only be futile, but dangerous to both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us. It would sound so improbable that everyone would</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt its truth and no proof of any kind could be pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced. On the other hand, we would only lay ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">open to blame for complicity in the death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So my friend was buried. The world seemed strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank and gray to me. I had not known that a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">roommate could mean so much in one's life. My mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a whirl of torment, for in the background of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind was the guilty feeling that I was to blame. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">own brain had contrived the devilish idea. It had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to me that my friend might be the victim. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind was filled with resentment against the German.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surely the justice that in the movies always overtakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wicked, was lacking in the real world. Why had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possibility not occurred to me that the overbearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prussian might not get his just dues?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The more I thought about it, the more my resentment</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose against the cruel turn of fate, and against Schleicher</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. He had murdered my friend! I determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascertain how, to prove it, and to prosecute him. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could thus avenge my friend, I could at least justify</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself in my own eyes for the regrettable part I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">played in the affair. It could not bring my friend back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it might wipe out my guilty feeling. I thought about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it constantly, alternating between the depression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-censure and the efforts of solving the mystery. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite unable to attend to my class work. The prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem interfered with my sleep and appetite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FINALLY, 1 went to LeCount. My regular course</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring me under his instruction the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">year, and I had no hesitation in seeking his acquaintance</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was short and rotund, with a fat, grey mustache.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His students looked up to him with awe because of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">learning and with fear because of his snappy manners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found him at a microscope in the Pathology Lab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oratory. He was not much of a conversationalist; when</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 tried to explain why I had come, he jerked out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Tell me all of it this time 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That embarrassed me from the beginning; evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">he referred to my testimony before the coroner's jury,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in some uncanny way knew that I had withheld</seg><seg type="columnLine">.some information. Then he sat motionless, without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiver of a muscle all the time I was telling the story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">After I had finished, he continued to stare at me until</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I thought I would go frantic. Finally I had to speak:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Do you think Schleicher killed him?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Of course he did!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"In God's name, how?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I don't know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That was all. He looked at me inscrutably. I did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not know what to do or say. His eyes were fixed on me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">until I began to think I had done it myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Possible, all right," he finally snapped. "Now go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over all the details of that Sunday morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As I talked, he interrupted me frequently:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Did he take a drink every morning?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Did he ever cut himself with his razor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The toothbrush! Ah, the toothbrush!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The dormitory is familiar to me," he mused as I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">concluded. "It is possible for someone to get into your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rooms during your absence, is it not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There is only one explanation possible. Your his-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tory eliminates every other. Some sort of poison-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But none was found in the post-mortem analyses-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He looked at me sternly for interrupting, and then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">went on as though I should have known better:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Here are some poisons that leave no trace perceptible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the analyst."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He pointed to a chapter in his own book on toxicology,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Aconitine kills in doses too small to leave any detect-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ible traces. Rattlesnake or cobra venom, if introduced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">directly into the circulation, that is, not through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stomach, also kills without leaving any traces for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">analyst. Finally, Vaughan's split-protein products have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much the same effect as the snake venoms."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He regarded me steadily for a while and then thrust</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Now do you have an idea how he met his death?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Of course, the poisons are a possibility," I pondered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But how were they administered? There are no marks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of needles-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Think some more. Perhaps you can recall if there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a spot of blood on the toothbrush?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes. Almost everyone's gums bleed occasionally dur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing the brushing of the teeth. Raputra was more sus-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ceptible to bleeding than I."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well? Did Schleicher know that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"He might have." I could not make out what he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">driving at.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"All right. We can probably eliminate the aconitine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Death by that is slower than this man's was, and does</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not produce the convulsion that seemed to be present in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this case. But either snake-vernom or split-protein placed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the toothbrush Saturday night when both of you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were out celebrating the football victory, would intro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">duce enough poison directly into the bloodstream to have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caused just such a death. Where's the toothbrush?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"In the room. I don't think it has been touchcd since</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In response to his curt nod, I bolted out and was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back with the toothbrush in twenty minutes. By the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time I returned, he had two quinea-pigs ready. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first injected one with some physiological salt solution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That is the control," he said; "just to prove that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">salt solution is pure and harmless."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The guinea-pig was quite unconcerned after its ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perience. Then Dr. LeCount soaked the toothbrush for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes in a test-tube half full of the salt solu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion, and injected a syringeful of that into the second</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pig. He hardly had time to remove the needle; the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">animal shivered, kicked convulsively several times and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Of course, I can't tell you whether it is rattlesnake</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or cobra; it might be split-protein. But, is that proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">136</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enough?" The doctor fixed his wide, blue eyes on me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's proof enough!" I exclaimed. "I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight to the District Attorney's office. I'll get Schlei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cher yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. LeCount smiled. That was a rare thing. It meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The District Attorney's office does not close until four</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock. It is now eleven," he said deliberately. "Wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I waited, while he studied me. I felt like a germ</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a slide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the first place," he began in his favorite phrase,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"scientific proof is not legal proof.

My work is the study</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disease, not of law; but I get mixed up with law often</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to know that you can never get a case against</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man. You may prove it morally and scientifically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not legally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Secondly," he eyed me fixedly, "for a scientific man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are inconsistent. You'll have to reason more rigidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that if you want to pass my class next year. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men stepped out of the bounds of the law when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged their duel. Now all parties concerned should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be satisfied. To invoke the law now is childish in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of a fair man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Finally, what about the part you played in it? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have thought of this possibility when you planned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the duel. Now you are apt to get into trouble as an ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I left his presence humble, but not subdued. The de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sire for revenge is a shamefully primeval impulse; it is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful, that its suppression causes even civilized men</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable difficulty. As I walked down the street, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook my fists in the air, vowing that I would get Schlei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cher somehow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Involuntarily my footsteps carried me toward Schlei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cher's residence. For--and it doubled my resentment--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schleichcr was evidently independently wealthy; at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spent money as though he were. He never got suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficiently accustomed to Chicago's ways to live in a fiat</seg><seg type="columnLine">or an apartment. He occupied one of the cottages in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the row opposite Washington Park, and had a flower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden in his front yard. Gardening was his hobby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I recollected that he had not been seen since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day of the challenge. Was it guilt that kept him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealment? The report had gone about his laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was confined to his home by sickness. I strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly toward his house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There he was now in his garden, sprinkling with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hose. If he had been sick, he must have just recovered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it was his first appearance. I walked slowly past</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the opposite side of the street. He stood stiffly, hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his red face arrogantly above the rest of humanity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moving the stream of water from his hose with</seg><seg type="columnLine">military precision. He didn't even see me. I execrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; I almost shook my fist at him. I wondered what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do next.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll get you somehow-" my thoughts began, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schleicher had toppled over and lay flat on the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been standing in his stiff, military attitude,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spraying the hose this way and that on the flowers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrubbery. Then right before my eyes he dropped like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slaughtered ox. Now he lay still and the hose spurted</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him in an arch where it had fallen out of his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I reached him first though a number of people also</seg><seg type="columnLine">came running up. His heart seemed to flutter a little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as I felt of it, it stopped still. Half a dozen people</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered before I had him looked over. He was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly dead. Nowhere on him was there a scratch</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a mark of any kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another sudden death! Another secret, silent, scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific blow! This time the mystery of it elated me. I left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others crowding around the body, while I eagerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked the surroundings over carefully, behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence, under the porch, through the shrubbery, hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I might find a clue to the method.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, a gleam of metal, hidden in the shrubbery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused me to halt and stagger back. I had caught myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">just in time to prevent my hand from touching it. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an insulated copper plate concealed in the bush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From it ran a cable which I quickly trace' toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson Park Elevated Railway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole scheme was clear to me now. I understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meaning of the coil of cable and the bag of tools that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raputra had carried out of our room with him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night that he had spent out. The plate in the bush was</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected with the third rail of the elevated railway, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the water from Schleicher's hose struck it, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful current that ran the trains overhead had elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trocuted him on the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd about the body increased. The distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">clanging of an ambulance swelled rapidly. I stood off</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the crowd and reflected. Things seemed to bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lance now. Appropriately, by the hand of a man several</seg><seg type="columnLine">days in his grave, movie-justice had been done!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                     The End.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SPECIAL NOTICE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       EVEN before the appearance of our First ANNUAL of AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       STORIES, with its famous "The Master Mind of Mars," by Edgar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       Rice Burroughs, hundreds of our readers showed great interest in this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       world-famous story, and consequently swamped our office with advance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         Now, for the convenience of those readers who were unable to purchase a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         copy, we have, for immediate disposal, a few remaining copies.

The aeroplane slowed and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to foil his stroke, and dropped too low. Just in time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the wind-wheels of Bromley hill rushing up towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and spun about and up as the aeroplane he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">chasing crashed among them. All its voices wove into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt of yelling. The great fabric seemed to be standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on end for a second among the heeling and splintering</seg><seg type="columnLine">vans, and then it flew to pieces. Huge splinters came</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying through the air, its engines burst like shells. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot rush of flame shot overhead into the darkling sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two!" he cried, with a bomb from overhead bursting</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it fell, and forthwith he was beating up again. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious exhilaration possessed him now, a giant activity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His troubles about humanity, about his inadequacy, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone for ever. He was a man in battle rejoicing in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. Aeroplanes seemed radiating from him in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, intent only upon avoiding him, the yelling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their packed passengers came in short gusts as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept by. He chose his third quarry, struck hastily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">did but turn it on edge. It escaped him, to smash against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall cliff of London wall. Flying from that impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">he skimmed the darkling ground so nearly he could see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened rabbit bolting up a slope. He jerked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeply, and found himself driving over south London</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the air about him vacant. To the right of him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild riot of signal rockets from the Ostrogites banked</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumultuously in the sky. To the south the wreckage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen air ships flamed, and east and west and north</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air ships fled before him. They drove away to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">east and north, and went about in the south, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not pause in the air. In their present confusion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">any attempt at evolution would have meant disastrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">collisions. He could scarcely realize the thing he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. In every quarter aeroplanes were receding. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were receding. They dwindled smaller and smaller. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in flight!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He passed two hundred feet or so above the Roehamp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton stage. It was black with people and noisy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their frantic shouting. But why was the Wimbledon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Park stage black and cheering, too? The smoke and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame of Streatham now hid the three further stages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He curved about and rose to see them and the northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters. First came the square masses of Shooter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hill into sight from behind the smoke, lit and orderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the aeroplane that had landed and its disembarking</seg><seg type="columnLine">negroes. Then came Blackheath, and then under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the reek the Norwood stage. On Blackheath</seg><seg type="columnLine">no aeroplane had landed but an aeropile lay upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guides. Norwood was covered by a swarm of little fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures running to and fro in a passionate confusion. Why?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruptly he understood. The stubborn defence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying stages was over, the people were pouring into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">under-ways of these last strongholds of Ostrog's usurpa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. And then, from far away on the northern border</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the city, full of glorious import to him, came a sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a signal, a note of triumph, the leaden thud of a gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His lips fell apart, his face was disturbed with emotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drew an immense breath. "They win," he shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the empty air; "the people win!" The sound of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second gun came like an answer. And then he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeropile on Blackheath was running down its guides to</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch. It lifted clean and rose. It shot up into the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving straight southward and away from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an instant it came to him what this meant. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">needs be Ostrog in flight. He shouted and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards it. He had the momentum of his elevation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell slanting down the air and very swiftly. It rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeply at his approach. He allowed for its velocity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove straight upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It suddenly became a mere flat edge, and behold! he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was past it. and driving headlong down with all the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his futile blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was furiously angry. He reeled the engine back</seg><seg type="columnLine">along its shaft and went circling up. He saw Ostrog's</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine beating up a spiral before him. He rose straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards it, won above it by virtue of the impetus of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sw'oop and by the advantage and weight of a man. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped headlong--dropped and missed again! As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed past he saw the face of Ostrog's aeronaut con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fident and cool and in Ostrog's attitude a wincing resolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Ostrog was looking steadfastly away from him--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the south. He realized with a gleam of wrath how</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungling his flight must be. Below he saw the Croyden</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills. He jerked upward and once more he gained on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced over his shoulder and his attention was ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested by a strange thing. The eastward stage, the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Shooter's Hill, appeared to lift; a flash changing to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall grey shape, a cowled figure of smoke and duct,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked into the air. For a moment this cowled figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood motionless, dropping huge masses of metal from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its shoulders, and then it began to uncoil a dense head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke. The people had blown it up, aeroplane and all!</seg><seg type="columnLine">As suddenly a second flash and grey shape sprang up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Norwood stage. And even as he stared at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a dead report, and the air wave of the first explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck him. He was flung up and sideways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment the aeropile fell nearly edgewise with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her nose down, and seemed to hesitate whether to overset</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether. He stood on his wind-shield wrenching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel that swayed up over his head. And then the shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the second explosion took his machine sideways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found himself clinging to one of the ribs of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, and the air was blowing past him and upward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seemed to be hanging quite still in the air, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind blowing up past him. It occurred to him that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was falling. Then he was sure that he was falling. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not look down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found himself recapitulating with incredible swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness all that had happened since his awakening, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days of doubt, the days of Empire, and at last the tumul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuous discovery of Ostrog's calculated treachery. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beaten but London was saved. London was saved!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought had a quality of utter unreality. Who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">he? Why w-as he holding so tightly with his hands?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why could he not leave go? In such a fall as this count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less dreams have ended. But in a moment he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His thoughts ran swifter and swifter. He wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he should see Helen again. It seemed so unreasonable</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he should not see her again. It must be a dream! ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet surely he W'ould meet her. She at least was real.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was real. He would wake and meet her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although he could not look at it, he was suddenly aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the earth was very near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE END</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 137</seg><seg type="columnLine">TERRORS the UPPER AIR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hy Frank Orndorff</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TERRORS OF THE UPPER AIR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">139</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EMBERTON, the Great Detective, renowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">as never having failed to get his man, spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Secretary of the President of the State</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fair, and passed on to the President's</seg><seg type="columnLine">office door marked "Private." He entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">without knocking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well! What happening is responsible for this visit?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The President sprang up and grasped Pemberton's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pulled a chair out for him. "You are not in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit of calling on me lately except on business. Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the unlucky people at the Fair that you want? For</seg><seg type="columnLine">my guess is that you are after some poor birds."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pemberton sat down and placed his hat on the Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent's desk.

'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The very two men I am after."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what have they done? It must be something</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is serious. You remember the Windsor Bank Rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bery of over a week ago, where the cashier was killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nearly a half a million dollars, mostly in large bills</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stolen? The two men who did the job escaped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an auto. They were chased to a large wooded tract just</seg><seg type="columnLine">about nightfall. When the pursuers closed in, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the car but the men and the money were gone."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I remember that and also the mystery of their escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hundreds of men that surrounded the woods."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They did not escape through this fence of men, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">over them. As soon as I had gone over the ground, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found tracks of where an aeroplane had made a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">run in a break in the woods and could easily have shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">upwards above the trees and away. The place was far</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough from the edge of the woods, to enable the roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the motor to go unheard as the two men fled away in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The run to the woods and the flight in the aeroplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">was most likely planned ahead by the two men and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have remained undiscovered had it not been for a mark</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in the soft ground by two small cuts in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aeroplane tires.

It clung to the wire, thrashing about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blood of that pale greenish color oozing out. When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ready to go out on the wing and try to get it, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell on the lower plane and was blown off. It fell below</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the plant island over which we are flying now. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had struck either of us, it would have been death. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">short distance more and we will make the dive for earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">as our oxygen supply is getting low. I have been catch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stray pieces of the plants of which the islands are</seg><seg type="columnLine">made and have a bunch packed in the bottom of my cock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit. There is also a large bunch caught in the wires</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our left wing and several small bunches caught in</seg><seg type="columnLine">other places. These might hold fast until we get down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been wondering if the change of pressure on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant and animals--if we can catch any animals to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">down--will cause them to contract. The effect on them</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be just the opposite of the effect on the fish that</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been brought up from two miles or more under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea; when they came up, the pressure was so much less</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some swelled up and exploded. I believe these ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals would be pressed together more if brought to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">denser air of the earth's surface. This plant up here</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be made good use of below at some future time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and if of all the sights-what monsters! What</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce fighting monsters. Look at the great gashes they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are tearing in each other. They can't last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh, I forgot, you below--we just turned a half circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the end of a medium sized floating island and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come upon one of the most awful battles between two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">(he biggest and fiercest of monsters. One is like a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying alligator, except that it has a huge beak and large</seg><seg type="columnLine">bat-like wings. The other is shaped like an octopus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but has flat arms and two large balloon-like appendages</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its back. It has a hellish beak. They are closed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one biting, clawing and choking mass. We are circling</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and watching. The flying alligator just laid open</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the devil-fish of the air's balloons. It shrank as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it were full of gas. Now they are whirling on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air so fast you can hardly tell what is happening. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">alligator has lost the use of one of its wings. The octopus</seg><seg type="columnLine">has wrapped several of its arms around it. They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting to sink. They're dropping, two of the arms, bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten off. Everything up here is that sickly green, both mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters are that color and they are bleeding the green blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">--if it is blood. They are now covered with gashes all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over their bodies. They can't last much longer. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes the other balloon. It shrinks--now they are falling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">i f'T'HEY don't stop fighting. We are following them</seg><seg type="columnLine">I down and still circling around them. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting air demons have fallen on the big island below</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. They are hardly able to move. The alligator devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">is now on top and rending the octopus to shreds. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">days are over. The flying alligator--for I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what else to call it--is victor, but it will never be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fly again. One wing is completely torn in shreds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other is not much better. Its body is full of big</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds. The din of their screams and clashing of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaks must have been awful. Where they came from or</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they were fighting about, we do not know. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the most terrific and most awe-inspiring sights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">man ever witnessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The flying alligator has risen on its hind legs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">is trying to lunge itself into the air, but it can only</seg><seg type="columnLine">flutter like a broken-winged bird. It is giving out its</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry. as we can see by the motion of its beak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dex shut off the motor for an instant and drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">• &lt;e over its head. It uttered a piercing scream like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand wild cat whistles, and lunged up for us. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate to think what would have happened if it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to fly. I believe it would have rent us in pieces in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second. We are leaving here right now, for Dex has</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out another flying alligator about a mile away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is coming this way. It must be answering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded one's cries. It is traveling fast and coming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north. We can see its giant, bat-like wings beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air and it rises and falls at each stroke. We are</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding westward and as soon as we reach the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this extra large floating island over which we are flying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will dive for the earth. We can not see the edge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it cannot be over a mile or so. We have left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded flying alligator about a half mile back, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other monster has already reached it and has circled</seg><seg type="columnLine">above it once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''God, it has turned and is headed after us, its huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings beating faster than before. We must reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge and dive, for it travels twice as fast as our slug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gish-acting machine. I am not scared, for I can see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge about two miles ahead and we will reach it before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the demon can overtake us. Another has dropped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">above where the wounded alligator is and it, also, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">now headed after us. Miles above the earth and being</seg><seg type="columnLine">chased by two hideous monsters. Have you ever noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds flying? When they beat their wings downwards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they not only go forward, but partly upward as well, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they raise their wings for another stroke, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sink a little instead of keeping a straight course ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is the way these demons fly. Dex is giving our</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine all it will take.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The two demons are going fast, but we will reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge before they can catch us. God help us, an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other monster and straight ahead. We can not go that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and must turn south or north. No, not north for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	see two coming from that direction. We are nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded and our only hope is south. I see the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">south, but it is a mile farther away than west. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will make it. I don't see any of the demons coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that direction. Our machine is roaring at full</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, but we are not making over fifty or sixty miles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this rarefied sir. The demons of this upper air are</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying twice as fast and now there are nearly a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">close on our trail and swiftly gaining. . . . We are near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge and our danger is over. A minute more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would have been lost, for now there are two monsters</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of us. We are surrounded, but we will reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge and will head down like a bullet before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">can get near enough to head us off. Their screams are</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing other monsters from all directions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just passed one of those hideous flying devil-fish and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see another ahead and above us.

We are within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few hundred feet of the edge, the weight of the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine has sunk us until we rest in a sloping crater</seg><seg type="columnLine">about fifty feet deep.

Our motor is quiet and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we raise our receivers, the screams and snapping of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant beaks almost deafen us. Our only hope now is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the edge and trust ourselves to our safety para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chutes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several minutes the horns were quiet and the peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple jammed around them listening for further word from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men in the void above. They whispered together</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TERRORS OF THE UPPER AIR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">143</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in low under-tones and every minute or so their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled upward in an attempt to pierce the blind of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles distance.

They seem to be afraid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come into this pit we are in. We found a place on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the pit where the vegetable has been pulled until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has pulled apart and we can see below. We are going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this hole now and enlarge it sufficiently to enable us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drop through--all is clear below--so good bye, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch for us to come sailing down soon. We are carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen tanks with us to breathe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voice ceased and the crowd began to watch above</seg><seg type="columnLine">for any specks that might turn out to be the two men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their parachutes. Many minutes passed, then the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, a voice filled with a tone of despair and terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(f'T'HEY got poor Dexter. He went first, after we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">A enlarged the hole, and before he had dropped five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet a dozen of the monsters were after him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helpless in the parachute, they dived on him and dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him up to the top of the island and tore him to shreds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now they are screaming and snapping their beaks above</seg><seg type="columnLine">this pit and are swooping nearer and nearer. .

I'm lost--Good-bye."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shriek of a man in mortal agony and terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang out in the air, followed by a shriek from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd. Then all was still. The people knew all was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in the far upper air. Men stood gazing upward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly white, while women buried their faces in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and wept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A dull thud was heard at the far side of the infield</seg><seg type="columnLine">and people began to gather there on a run. A hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed where something had fallen with enough force to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bury itself. Hurriedly digging, they unearthed an oxy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gen tank, one of the tanks that Kidwell and Dexter had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken up with them. A cry from some people as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed aloft drew thousands of eyes in that direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fluttering and falling, something was coming down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several hands grabbed it as soon as it came within reach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One uttered a cry and let go.

They were wet with fresh blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A broken and torn part of an aeroplane wing, spat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered with red blood, fell.

I am informed, though, that such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">current would not necessarily always be in the same place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">else it might stop altogether, just like winds near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth.
