            <seg type="columnLine">• It is surprising that we, who pride ourselves on our ac-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">■ quired knowledge, have to admit that in the end there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is really nothing that is known to any degree.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> It is really Amazing how little knowledge we actually</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have on ANY subject, and how little man can hope to know</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of his surroundings. Whether we go up to the heavens or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down into sub-microscopical worlds, the story is always the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">same. We find that there is nothing knowable and if we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were to draw a scale we would have to admit that our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knowledge on any subject, compared to a mile measuring</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stick would probably not go further than the thousandths</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of an inch on this scale.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The trouble, of course, is the limitation of our senses.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">We can hear only over a comparatively minute range of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sound; we can see only over an infinitesimally small section</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the spectrum; we can feel only the surface of some of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the objects and these most imperfectly; we can smell prac-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tically nothing; and our sense of taste is woefully deficient.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> It seems that only the effects of certain things are per-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ceptible to us, and even those to no large extent. Take</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">such a simple thing as sound. We have not the slightest</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">idea of what sound actually is. The same of light. Noth-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing at all is known about the actual nature of light today,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and we certainly do not know much more about it than</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was known in Newton's time, possibly less. We know</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a number of light phenomena, and we know</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">what happens when light strikes certain objects, but of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the nature of light itself, how it is propagated into space</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we know next to nothing.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The same is true, of course, of such instrumentalities as,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for instance, radio waves,--although it is still an open</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">question that they are waves. They might be something</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">entirely different, that we know nothing about. What hap-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pens after these so-called waves leave the transmitting</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">aerial until they strike the receiving aerial, nothing at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all is known.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> When we come down to material objects, the case grows</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">even more hopeless. No matter what you touch -or feel,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nothing at all is known about the ultimate constitution of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">such matter. Every year scientists change their definitions</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of molecules, atoms, electrons and protons, all of which are</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">theoretical, because man has never seen or felt one; and it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would seem that for thousands of years to come, nothing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">can possibly be known about the ultimate constitution of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">matter.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> On the other end of the scale, nothing much is known</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">either. We talk glibly about our planetary system and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stars beyond--island universes and nebulas--but nothing is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">actually known of these. One theory is as good as another,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and even the origin of our own planet and the solar system</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is subject to a great deal of controversy. In truth, no one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knows anything about it, and here again one theory is as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">good as another.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> How can we have any knowledge of the world around</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">us when we have not the slightest knowledge of ourselves?</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">We do not know what makes us think, what makes us rea-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">son, and we have no proof that our reasoning, such as it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is, is correct. The interpretations which we place upon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">most things are simply the result of following someone else</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who thinks he had the right idea about it, but probably</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fifty years or a thousand years hence it will be found that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">our entire reasoning was wrong from beginning to end.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Our senses by no means guide us aright. Thus, for in-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Its outward form was more or less spherical, with flattened</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">time-sphere and the other at the feet of the belligerent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">alien mechanism. Afterwards they retired discreetly as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they had come. The whole performance had the air of a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">religious rite--a sacrificial offering, intended to appease</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doubtful or angry deities.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Not without inward amusement, I wondered what use</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the time-sphere was supposed to make of the oily liquid.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It seemed probable that we and our conveyance were re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">garded as a single mechanism, active and intelligent, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">perhaps similar in kind to the curious robot we had found</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">occupying the dais.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The latter machine, however, was manifestly familiar</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with such offerings; for, without acknowledgment or cere-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mony, it proceeded to stoop over and dip certain of its</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">metal proboscides in the oil. These organs, I perceived,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were hollow at the ends, like the trunks of elephants; and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I saw that the liquid in the basin was diminishing rapidly,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as if it were being sucked up.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> When the vessel was half empty, the monster withdrew</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">its proboscides; and then, by the simultaneous use of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">these members, turning and coiling with great suppleness</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in different directions, it began to oil the innumerable</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">joints and flanges of its intricate, machinery. Several</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">times it suspended this remarkable process, eyeing the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time-sphere balefully as if watching for a hostile move-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ment. The whole performance was inconceivably gro-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tesque and ludicrous--and sinister.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The main floor of the huge pillared hall, I now saw,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had filled with the pigmy warriors, who were seated about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the flower-burdened tables. All of them seemed to be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">inhaling the odors of these flowers in a manner that re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sembled actual ingustation; and I conceived the idea that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they were regaling themselves with a feast of perfumes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and perhaps required no other nutriment.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">• Turning from this quaint spectacle, to which I had given</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">only a cursory glance, I perceived that the metal mon-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ster had apparently finished the anointing of its complex</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">machinery and was again posting itself in an attitude</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">preparatory for battle. There was a stealthy turning of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">half-hidden wheels and cogs, a covert throbbing of well-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">oiled pistons, as the mechanism faced us; and certain of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">its tentacles were poised in air like lifted weapons.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> What would have happened next, in the normal course</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of events, I am not altogether sure; but the probabilities</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">are that we w'ould have been blotted out of existence very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">promptly, efficiently and summarily. Again, by a singu-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lar intervention, the time-vessel was saved from the anger</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Without warning, there came a flash of brilliant blind-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">tween the dais and the dome. There was a crashing,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shivering noise that shook and penetrated our virtually</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sound-proof walls; and everything about us seemed to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rock with the convulsions of a violent earthquake. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">concussion hurled us back upon our dynamos; and I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought for an instant that the sphere would be flung from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the dais. Recovering myself, 1 saw that a third machine</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">had materialized on the dais, opposite the time-sphere and</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> This machine differed as much from the hostile robot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as the latter, in its turn, differed from the timc-globe. It</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was a sort of immense polyhedron, with an arrangement</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of numberless facets alternately opaque and transparent.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Through some of the facets, clearer than glass, I was hor-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rified and astonished to behold the thronging faces of en-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tities similar to, or perhaps identical with, the beings who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had threatened us from the air-vessel in that far-off world</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">where we had picked up our unusual passenger.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> There could be only one explanation; we had been pur-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sued through the cosmic continuum by these vengeful and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pertinacious creatures, who had evidently employed a liine-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">space vehicle of their own. They must have possessed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">unique instruments of incredible range and delicacy by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which to detect and follow onr course in the labyrinth of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stellar gulfs and ages! Turning to our passenger, I saw</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by his troubled air and frantic gestures that he too had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">recognized the pursuers. ■Since I had not yet been able to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">repair our machinery, the position in which we now stood</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was a serious dilemma. We were without weapons of any</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">kind, for it had not even occurred to me to bring along a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">revolver. I began to wish that I had fitted the time-ma-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> However, there was little time for either regret or ap-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prehension. The course of events was now' taking an un-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">diverted from its war-like designs upon us by the appear-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ance of the newcomer, had immediately squared itself</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">around to face the polyhedron, with its metal members</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The occup^gls of the polyhedron, on their part, seemed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">gan to slide back in the manner of ports, and revealed the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">yawning mouths of tubular weapons, all of which were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">levelled at the time-sphere. It appeared that these people</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The robot, it would seem, construed the opening of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">forward, winnowing the air with all its tentacles and pro-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">raising one of its hollow proboscides, it snorted forth a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sudden jet of crimson flame--a briefly flaring tongue that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Undismayed by this, the wielders of the tube-weapons</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">concentrated their violet beams on the robot, inflicting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">terrific damage. The uppermost of the three globular</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heads was partly shot away, and metal filaments trailed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from its broken rim like a shredded brain. The serried</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">array of tossing members was torn and lopped like a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that his teeth chattered. It did not last, however, and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> His flashlight had now joined his revolver at the top</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">floated around in the air without seeming to be even in-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">terested in the phenomenom. The science fiction authors</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seemed to think that the sensation would be annoying;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they emphasized its discomforts. John Hand thought it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would be fun. But he had never hoped for the chance</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">his legs. He felt a foot taller. His arms floated lightly.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">They had a tendency to fly up above his head; a natural</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">muscular reaction, he thought. He squatted down, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">took off his shoes. They probably had metal insertion</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">also, he thought. He dragged the garment from one leg,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then from the other. As he held it in his hands, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rolled over forwards. He dropped it, and pushed against</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the floor with his hands. In a moment, he was floating</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">legs in foolish panic. Then his good sense came to his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">strain from any direction. A man is comfortable stand-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">When he rolls over in bed, more than a hundred pounds</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it doesn't hurt him. Why, then, should the removal of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the pull cause discomfort? John Hand found that it</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The necessary posture was back-breaking. He consid-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ered what his next move should be. He had no idea of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">getting through the adventure unseen. In fact, his first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">plan had been to secret himself there until breakfast time,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and grapple with the waiter when that functionary should</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">appear. He wanted information, and he didn't much care</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">how he got it. That was his attitude.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> But now he reconsidered. He couldn't stay bent up like</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this until morning. Should he go to bed, and come back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">later? Or should he try to go farther now, unaided by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the waiter?</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> No harm in trying, he thought. He felt around the edge</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the inner wall of the cupboard. There was a crack.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It must be another panel, he thought. He managed to get</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his fingernails under it; but it wouldn't move.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He was balked. There was nothing remotely resembling</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a tool in the four rooms. There wouldn't be, of course.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He started to crawl out of the cupboard. Then he had an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">idea.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> This cupboard had two sliding panels, opposite each</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">other. When one was open, the other must be closed.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Perhaps the arrangement was automatic ... Slowly he low-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ered the panel through which he had come. When it was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nearly to the bottom, he heard a click. Now he tried the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">other, and it came up easily. He closed*the other one all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the way.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He was looking into the strangest corridor he had ever</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seen. It was about twenty feet long. But it was twice as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">deep. The floor of it was twenty feet below him. In the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ceiling, the same distance above, soft lights burned. It</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was narrow; and its walls were like cliffs, facing each</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">other--cliffs with doorways in them like gulls nests, all up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and down the surface.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> For a minute he was completely bewildered. Then he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saw the reason for it. The inhabitants of this place did</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not use gravity. The artificial gravity of the prisoners'</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">apartment was not for them. They flew and floated. Stair-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cases were superfluous. Now he saw projections all over</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the walls which must be handholds.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> With a slight grimace, he launched himself into the cor-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ridor, floating horizontally. He checked his flight at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">first doorway, scratching and grabbing at the wall; and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">peered through it. The room was a kitchen, he saw in-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">1 stantly. No one was in it. He was glad of that.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He reflected. If he went batting around at random, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was sure to run into someone soon; and then his flight</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would be rudely checked. What he wanted to do was to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">get to the outside of this structure.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> With this idea in mind, he plunged downwards to-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wards a doorway at the bottom of the corridor on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">end. Sailing warily through this aperture, he found him-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">self amon^ machinery. The room was full of it: levers,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dials, gauges, and switches. No one was in this room</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">either. He was surprised at that. Didn't they tend their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">machinery? The whole place had a deserted aspect, for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that matter. It was silent as a tomb. If they were going</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to let him alone like this, thought John Hand, he might</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">discover a great deal.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Then he saw the window. It had a bluish gleam. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blood of mounting excitement throbbed in his temples.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He made his way to the window.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "Good God!"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The exclamation was wrung from his lips by what he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saw. Before him lay a great, deep sea of beautiful,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">diaphanous blue! Behind this opalescent curtain he could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">see dimly shapes which were familiar to him. There was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a long, wavering, indented line--light on one side, dark on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the other. There were other lines, the courses of which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had known from boyhood ... An outline map! The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Great Lakes! The Atlantic coastline!</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> A thrill of mingled triumph and awe shook his very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">soul. He had been right! Right! . . . But, oh God,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">what a difference between the theory and the actuality!</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The immensity of the spectacle left him weak and sick. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">muttered and babbled to himself brokenly ... So far</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">away! What was he--so far away from the good Earth?</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He trembled. With that awesome emptiness between,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could he still be a living, breathing man? Or was he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dreaming? Or was he dead?</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">• The absurdity of the last idea helped him to conquer his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fit of terror. He came out of it, laughing weakly. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was thinking, now, what a feeble creature he had turned</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">out to be when it came to real scientific adventure. A real</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">science fiction hero would have glanced casually out of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that window, taking stock of his position without batting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an eye. Probably he would have been quite bored because</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the Earth was so near. He would have longed for the far</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reaches of the outer moon of Jupiter--or some place like</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that, where a man could get a thrill. Above all, he would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have been practical in his attitude--not emotional. John</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Hand resolved firmly to emulate the science fiction hero,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">even if it killed him. He looked out of the window again.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> This time--benefitted by his new attitude--he saw a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing that was of more immediate interest than the Earth--■</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and much closer. It was attached to the ship. It was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">huge windlass--or winding drum; and from it there ex-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tended towards the Earth a great, shining cable. He fol-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lowed the cable with his eye--farther and farther into the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blue, until it was lost there. The drum was unwound.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he was startled by a sound somewhere in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ship behind him. With clumsy haste, he turned himself</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">around and pushed away from the window. He found that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he was floating swiftly towards a row of levers. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stretched out an arm to check his flight. His hand slipped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on a smooth metal surface, and his whole forearm plunged</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down among the levers. Immediately, the entire room</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seemed to lurch sidewise. The opposite wall rushed to-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wards him. and struck him a stunning blow. He grasped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blindly with both hands for something to steady him.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "You fool! What have you done?"</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The voice was harsh, but it had a familiar ring. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">managed to turn himself. Gordon Wintermaine was in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the doorway, glaring at him, his face very flushed. John</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Hand stared at him stupidly for a moment. Then his</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Wintermaine's eyes wavered for a split second. Then:</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> "You did not!" John Hand's voice crackled. His face</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Wintermaine came into the room, making for the row</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, the room lurched again--downwards this</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the Earth's surface--at first idly, then anxiously. A small</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">continent had rolled away--Australasia; and now a broad</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ocean lay beneath him. It made him shiver.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Things began to happen more swiftly now. Almost be-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fore he knew it, he was well into the atmosphere. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">faint blue color of it extended on all sides of him. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Earth began to loom large in his sky. Would that ocean</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">never pass? At last a faint, dark shore-line appeared, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he grinned with joy. But it seemed to come around so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slowly! He reflected that the air must be pushing him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">around now, too; and groaned. When he opened the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">parachute the air would push him more. He resolved to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wait until the last possible moment to do that.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Now he imagined that his glass coffin was getting warm-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">er. He tried not to think about it. Soon, however, there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could be no doubt about it. He even felt the heat beating</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">against his skin. He closed his eyes, and waited as long</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as he could stand the heat, in an agony of suspense. Then</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Now he acted as swiftly as he could. He fumbled with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the rope, and tore it from his wrist. He jerked viciously</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at the cord attached to his helmet. With a sigh of relief,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he felt a strong upward pull. The gold dropped away.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> He suffered agonies of burning. Gritting his teeth, he</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Then the burning heat subsided. Blazing white sand</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">village, built around a clump of fe*thery palms. Soon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">after that, the ground began to come up fast. He crunched</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into the sand, was dragged a ways, and then lay still.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">were other black faces behind, and shining, naked bodies.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Anxiously, he looked into tEe faces for signs of intelli-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">something, and let him starve in there! Their mouths</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were gaping--their eyes wide with awe. It was evident</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that they did not dare to touch his metal suit. He cursed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to me as I was reading a story in the April</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">issue entitled "The Man Who Shrank." It's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">just this. All the correspondents have been</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">only that but each one of his manuscripts are</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">different from the first one. Most (notice I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">do not say all) authors write stuff on the same</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">general line. Keller writes mostly on biology</seg>
