        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The other sailor quickly followed him and went aft again, and, a moment</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">later, the delinquent stumbled up to the deck. He was in an ugly mood,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">having imbibed just enough liquor to enhance his naturally surly disposition.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">As he passed Thorne the latter heard him muttering and swearing to himself</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">cook ran from the cabin and handcuffs were snapped upon Atwell's wrists.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then he was hustled forward and dropped down the hatchway. ' ' I reckon</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The captain looked as though he thought of telling the young man that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But there was something in it all that went against Thorne's grain. He</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Yet Sydney Latimer was a perfect lady. During the afternoon, while set-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Thorne got himself settled, and was on deck in time to observe the work</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Captain Latimer's discipline, was at work with the other men, and did not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">raise his eyes from the deck. The huge sails were spread by means of patent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hoisting apparatus. Miss Latimer took the wheel, and the great vessel</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sheered off from the dock. The little donkey engine amidships made more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">commotion than the engines of an Atlantic liner, and the mulatto cook,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stripped to his waist, shoveling coal into its maw, looked like an imp in a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">his back for four days, and lived a simple and blameless life 011 toast and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beef tea. When he got upon deck again he found Monckton and Sydney</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Latimer as chummy as though they had known each other for years. Monck-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ton hadn't been ill an hour, and had the cheek to come around and commise-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">considered it to be a boorish remark. And the worst of it was, Monckton</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">' ' took the trick: ' ' by appearing hurt and walking off without uttering a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reply. Sydney moved away, too, but Thorne heard from it later through</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the captain.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" You're kinder rough on that Monckton," said he, good naturedly.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" But he don't seem ha'f a bad sort. I hear he got into kinder wild comp'ny</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at college, an' he's talcin' this v'yge to help him brace up. Never kick a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man when he's down, is my motto." •</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Thorne wondered what he would say if he had seen Monckton when he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">came aboard at New York. But he bit his lip and made no reply to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">good captain's pacific remarks. But he had injured himself with Sydney by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his thoughtless retort and, argue with himself as he might, it troubled him,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but lie continued to avoid Monckton, and in so doing deprived himself of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her society also. This was a trial, for, greatly as he disliked the idea of a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">girl holding the position she did on the Naida, her strong character had not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">failed to impress him. She made herself respected by all on board, and her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">calm judgment and knowledge of seamanship, was the open wonder of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">other mates.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Most wonderful girl / ever see," declared Mr. Pepper, " an' I was born</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the Cape, where gals, as well's boys, can sail a boat 'fore they get out of</seg>

        <ab>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was plain that Captain Latimer quite worshiped her, and trusted in her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">judgment in many things. But Thorne thought that among the men the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">satisfaction was not so general. They obeyed her well enough, but they evi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dently did not think it right in the captain to put a woman over them. With-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out a doubt Atwell fanned this flame of discontent.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As the days passed and the brig ran into warmer latitudes, the situation</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">became still more strained. Thorne's face more than once expressed his dis-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">approval when he saw Monckton and Sydney walking the deck together, or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">talking in the cabin during her watch below. Sydney resented it and showed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her resentment by treating Thorne more coolly while not abating her friend-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">liness with Monckton in the least.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Between the crew and the captain there was ill feeling, too, and every day</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it became more and more apparent. As has before been hinted, Captain</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Joshua Latimer was more than a little "close." The cabin table was very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">well, though plainly, supplied, and Thorne but seldom resorted to his private</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stores. But the food supplied the seamen was of course another matter.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The quality was all right--that is, the " salt horse " was of good quality, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the cook made eatable bread ; but the quantity was what the men grumbled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about. Captain Latimer was so economical that he doled out the food ver37</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">grudgingly to 'Tonio for the fo'castle mess.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This was a small matter, but in the mouth of a man like Atwell it became</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">great. And, more than once, Thorne suspected that Atwell and some of his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mates got liquor from some mysterious source. Captain Latimer was a strictly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">''temperate man, and all the liquor supposed to be aboard the Naida was a little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for medicinal purposes, locked up in the commander's cabin.</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was quite certain, too, that Monckton had none. In fact, the third</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mate, Mr. Pepper, told him that the agreement when old Monckton wrote</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for his son's passage was that no liquors were to be allowed aboard. Evi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dently the intention had been to make an effort to reform Carter, and Thorne</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was forced to admit that up to the present time the fellow had behaved himself</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">very respectably. The only liquor he had managed to bring on board was that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the pocket flask which Thorne had unceremoniously thrown overboard the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">night of his arrival. And Monckton hadn't forgiven him that, either. Thorne</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought possibly the fellow was too drunk to remember the occurrence, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one evening he was disabused of that idea.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The trouble started w'ith a very innocent discussion between Sydney and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Thorne at the supper table. The argument waxed warm, though in a spirit</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of perfect friendliness, until Monckton put in a word. Sydney tacitly ad-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mitted him into the discussion by replying; but Thorne very foolishly showed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that he was nettled by the fellow's uncalled for interference, and dropped the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">subject at once.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The cut was so direct that even Monckton's egotism was pierced. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flushed and passed several sharp comments, making Thorne the butt of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">others' laughter by turning his former arguments into ridicule. Thorne bit</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his lip, but made no reply until Miss Latimer had gone on deck. Then, as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Monckton still pursued his raillery, he reached one long arm over the table</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and knocked his persecutor out of his chair.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The cabin was in a tumult in an instant. Monckton's bantering was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">changed to ungovernable rage. He sprang up with an imprecation, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">both Mr. Sessions and Mr. Pepper got up also. ' Chairs were tipped over, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for an instant it looked as though Monckton would spring over the table at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the throat of his antagonist.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Thorne alone remained in his chair, his eyes on Monckton's face, his own</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">features as pale as death. Outwardly he was as calm as the tropical sea at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that instant ; inwardly he was full of a mad desire to seize the fellow and fol-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">low up that single blow with a sound thrashing.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" You miserable hound !" cried Monckton, finding his breath.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">His fingers crept behind him and sought his hip pocket. He was quite</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beside himself w7ith rage.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Calm yourself," said Thorne coldly, " and take your hand away from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that thing inyour pocket! Assure as you try to draw it on me I'll break everj7</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Monckton looked into the other's face and quailed. His fingers returned</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I'll thank you not to apply that term to me again," he said, so quietly</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Instantly Thorne leaped fairly over the cabin table, and, seemingly with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The fellow went down like a log and lay there without stirring, and at that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">very dramatic point Captain Latimer came hastily down the stairway.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"What's this! what's this, gentlemen?" he demanded. " A low row</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Thorne was silent. Pepper had raised Monckton into a chair, but neither</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he nor Sessions seemed willing to reply. Monckton himself was still too</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"What is it? I demand an answer, sir!" cried the old man, with</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I gave you no provocation, in the first place," snarled Monckton. " Not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">One or two little outbreaks had already occurred, and affairs between those</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Thorne continued to avoid the officers, including Sydney, and his fellow</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in his own cabin and paying 'Tonio something extra for his trouble. When</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">steered for the southeast and ran some days out of their course before the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that first gale seemed but a mild taste of what was in store for her. Three</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">gered on under the blow like a wearied courser. The sea sprang a few</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">planks in her old hull this time, too, and from that time on the clank of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">interest enough to care nuhom she made her friends. But for some reason it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was galling to him to have Sydney Latimer so familiar with a man of Carter</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">burly Mr. Pepper growling to the first mate, one day, that "the old man</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">should have put into Valparaiso for repairs." But although they were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nearly in the latitude of the Chilian port, they were a long way to the west-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ward of it. To run back would have meant an enormous waste--in the cap-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tain's opinion--of both time and food. And had he wished to run back, this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">soon became impossible. A third gale drove the brig into the northwest--a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">seemed to have no intention of ceasing. With but a few square feet of canvas</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spread, the Naida flew before the hurricane, and although a few seas broke</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over her, the waves wrenched her sorely.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The crew became more surly. Even the cook was unmanageable. The</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">brig's hold when he was down overhauling the stores. There was an entrance</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">through the bulkhead of the galley into the hold, and 'Tonio got to his pantry</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in that way. There was no other way to get into the lower part of the brig</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but by the hatches, and they were battened down. But the cook swore he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had seen a man climbing about over the cargo, and the captain had to detail</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Pepper to " break out " such stores as were needed.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was pitch dark in the place. It was almost as dark outside. As he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Thorne recoiled and threw up his arm to shield his head from the blow he</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He first fastened his precious valise securely to this poor raft. Then he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">but Thorne was carried safely beyond the rocks. Driven onward by the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">himself upon his knees, wrenched the oar free, and tried to paddle W'ith it ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but the implement was torn from his weakened grasp and he could only fall</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Had the boats bearing his companions in distress reached the land ? He</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The current had grasped his frail support as though with a giant hand,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">She knew more about the sea than he. He obeyed, still bearing her up</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He did so as another flash of the fitful lightning revealed their surround-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The two sailors had brought across the inlet a great quantity of the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They had occupied the cave near the inlet a week before Thorne felt</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">stayed the night of the wreck. He went alone, found the bag, and carried</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it back to the inlet. As he started to cross he saw that the tide had just</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turned and was now making strongly into the tunnel. At low water, as now,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the entrance to the mysterious passage was high enough for a good sized</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">boat to get through. Had the cutter been whole he would have been</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Stepping out upon the further bank he noticed, for the first time, that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the plateau in front of the cave was deserted. Neither the officers of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Naida, the cook, nor the two sailors, were in sight. Captain Latimer had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not moved from his bed since being brought to it, and he was never left</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">alone. But as Thorne hastened up the bank of the inlet he heard loud voices</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and a sudden fusillade of pistol shots from the direction of the beach.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Startled by the sounds, he sprang upon a boulder and strove to gain a view of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the shore. All he could see was a crowd of men struggling, nearly a quarter</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a mile away, and who were friends and who enemies he could not tell.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was a hoarse cry from Atwell, and Thorne saw the mutineer and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">bandage was tied over his eyes. He then heard them move away, and the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He looked on sky and sea--on the gray shingle and the towering bluffs.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The tide had just turned and in the inlet behind him the water was rushing</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He faced his murderers dully. Some of the faces revealed hesitation--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some indifference. But one there was that showed murder in every line.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Some bullets might fly wild when the word came to fire, but Atwell' would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reach its mark unerringly.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Thorne moistened his lips and spoke. " I am ready," he said.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But at the very moment his lips formed the words there was the splash of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">oars behind him in the inlet--an exclamation in a strange tongue--a hastily</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">uttered order. Thorne did not turn. He scarcely heard the interruption.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He gained his knowledge of it from the sudden change in the faces before</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then Thorne looked around. A large boat, manned by brawny, bare</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">armed men dressed in white, had just come out of the tunnel. The men</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were brown--the chocolate brown peculiar to the South Pacific islander.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Some of them brandished long oars ; but fully half a dozen had rifles.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In the bow stood the owner of the voice that had uttered the order--a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tall, commanding man--a white man--with flowing gray hair and beard.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">And beside him was a woman. Thorne looked on in the same dazed fashion,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as the man and his armed associates leaped ashore.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Almost a murder, eh?" said the leader sternly. Then lie repeated an</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" And who are you, sir ? " he asked, approaching Thorne.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The woman had disembarked, too, and was by his side. Thorne's gaze</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">went beyond his interrogator and rested on her face. And it was the face of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Sydney Latimer.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" This is he," she said to her companion. Then she stepped forward and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">took Thorne's hand. "Don't you know me, Mr. Thorne--Howard?" she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">asked, looking up at him with tear blinded eyes. " This is your father--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Edgar Thorne. I have told him about you."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The reprieved man reeled and would have fallen had the other not caught</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly Thorne awoke and opened his eyes. He was lying in a grass</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hammock in the shade of a thatched veranda. A pleasant, undulating</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">country, with smooth green meadows checked off with little garden patches,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was stretched out before him. In each garden plot was a low hut with a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">conical thatched roof. He did not know where he was. He was in that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blissful state between wTaking and sleeping where a man cares neither where</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he is nor what has happened ; when wonders cease to amaze and mysteries</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A slight, graceful figure in a flowing white garment sat by his side. One</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pretty hand rested on the hammock and swayed it back and forth ; the other</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upheld the face which was turned from him. It did not seem strange that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Sydney Latimer should be alive and beside him in the midst of these unfa-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">miliar scenes. He put out his fingers, surprised to find even such a slight</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">effort wearying', and laid them upon the hand on the hammock.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Sydney sprang to her feet and bent above him, her dark eyes shining like</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stars. He put his other hand upon her shoulder, and slight though his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">strength was, drew her nearer. Their lips met. Then she stood upright,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shook the hair back from her face and said :</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">That was a ridiculous question for a girl to ask a man just after she had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">When we were introduced, he simply nodded, without a word, and turned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">away, for which I mentally set him down as a sulky brute. But I was unjust,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as I soon learned, for the poor fellow was deaf and dumb. Despite my feel-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing that his affliction entitled him to pitying sympathy, I could not banish a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sense of repulsion that he awakened in me and felt that he returned my</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">instinctive aversion. All through dinner, if I glanced in his direction, I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">found his eyes fixed loweringly upon me, or upon Mary, as if he resented her</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that tore up forest trees and threatened to unroof the house and barn. That</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">you like it or not," he added, speaking directly at me, with a mischievous</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">little smile. He guessed, rightly, that I had expected to sit up with Mary</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">where nothing distracts his attention from watching you, where he cannot</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">tapped sharply with the forefinger of his right hand on my breast. I don't</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">mime and I nodded affirmatively, before I considered what I was doing. He</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the sheepskin wallet in which I had carefully stowed Uncle Billy's $847. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">scrutinized my countenance keenly a few seconds, then nodded, turned upon</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">self that such a thing in that house would be impossible, but something</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">We were yet so uncivilized that thieves were scarce among us. My room</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">door had only a simple thumb latch to hold it, and I could fasten it in no other</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">way than by jamming a splinter from a wall log into the little cast iron guard</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over the latch. Of course that did not secure it, but might prevent it being</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forced without such noise as would awaken me. The lower sash of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">window was held down by a big nail loosely thrust into a gimlet hole in the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">My bed had two mattresses, an upper one of thin corn shucks, and a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in changing the straw when it was mashed down. Before undressing, I lifted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the end of the upper one, opened the loose ticking of the lower and poked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">my wallet in among the straw. Then I got into bed, but lay awake a long</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time. I had a great big scare upon me about that money, utterly without</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reasonable foundation, but none the weaker therefor. If I'd had a pipe, I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would have dressed and sat up by the window all night, smoking and think-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing about Mary, with the wallet in my pocket. But I had no pipe. At</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">length, sleep insensibly stole upon me, and when I opened my eyes again, the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I sprang quickly out of bed, washed, and had nearly completed dressing,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I decided that I would lie to the judge ; that I would simply tell him I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had lost the money, without knowing where, and would get my father to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">make it good for me. But I never could lie well, easy as the accomplishment</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seems to many who are not even attorneys. The judge was in court--for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the defense in a murder trial--and I got no chance to speak with him until</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">after a late adjournment in the evening. Then I told him the story. I had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">planned that the wallet must have worked out of my pistol pocket while I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was in the saddle and dropped on the road. He heard me through without</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">interruption, and then said blandly, " Now, Bob, tell me the truth about it."</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Well, that " broke me all up," as the boys say now. I realized that, like</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">George Washington, I couldn't tell a lie, even though I wanted to. And for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the first time it flashed upon me that he might think I had appropriated the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">money for my own benefit. So I told him the whole story, just as it was;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about Mary and everything. He thought it all over for several minutes, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then said, with unusual deliberation of speech :</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">' ' I am averse to a positive finding upon merely circumstantial evidence ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but, so far as I can at present see, the only person to whom suspicion points is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jacob Arney. Mind ! I do not say that I think he stole the money, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">simply that the circumstantial evidence is unfavorable to him. But--why the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mischief should he have put a May apple in place of the wallet ? ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It hadn't struck me very forcibly before, but really it was an extraordinary</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing that he should have done so. Possibly he fancied there was something</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">humorous in the substitution ; but he did not look like a fellow addicted to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">humor. Finally the judge said,</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Luckily the term ended today, and I have a little leisure, so I'll ride</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"But, judge," I said, feeling anxious again about Mary, "even if we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">find he is guilty, I must beg of you not to prosecute him. It will be enough</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">if we get the money back. In fact, I would rather call upon my father to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">make it good for me than send to jail a poor fellow so deeply afflicted as Jacob</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is, and whose mind, for aught I know to the contrary, may be no better than</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" And, who is Mary's cousin," added the shrewd old judge, with a grin.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Well, I will not prosecute him, my boy. I have no such intention--pro-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The next forenoon we rode out to Arneys'. I felt that I could get</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">not be present, and congratulated myself upon having the judge along to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">do most of the talking, but fancy my feelings if you can, when, upon turn-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing from the highway into Arneys' lane, I recognized Mary's brown mare</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hitched at the gate and knew the girl would be inside the house. She had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ridden over from home that morning, on some woman's business between her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and her cousin, Hattie, and when I looked up from the mare to the house,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there she stood on the porch, with both the Arney girls.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I introduced Judge McDowell, who greeted the ladies with the graceful</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A sort of awkward pause ensued, then the judge stepped into the breach.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Mr. Griscom and myself," he said, " are out this morning on a rather</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">unpleasant errand. We are trying to look up some money he collected 011</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I said simply, "Yes," and she turned to the Arney girls with "Oh!</seg>

        <ab>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Oh, yes," she replied innocently. " I was talking with Hattie about</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">great agitation and being utterly unable to comprehend anything of what was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">going on, pushed himself forward, making frantic pantomimic gestures of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">appealing question and those horrible inarticulate sounds that burst from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dumb lips in moments of intense excitement. Evidently he was asking, in a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Something clung to its root and was drawn out with it--the chain attached</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">place. When a bo37 I had been a somnambulist, but the doctors told my</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I had climbed out of the window, found a hiding place for my valuables,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The nights lengthened and were cold, and the first snow of the new season had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">slept during the last two nights. In the morning his wife laid her hand on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his forehead and found it hot and clammy. She tried with all a woman's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">diplomacy to prevail upon him to change his course but in vain. Matters had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gone too far. She grieved severely over the thought that she herself had</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Early in December Erik and his wife reached the city of Copenhagen,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">after he had resigned his position as chemist at the factory in Roenninghof.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">They had agreed to impart no information of the great discovery to any</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">members of the family or their friends, but to make the facts public suddenly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and surprise all alike.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Their common sense told them that first of all they must derive some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">practical benefit themselves from the discovery. They could not deny that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when the facts were made public, gold would lose its value as a means of pay-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ment, and that the discoverer as well as every one else would be the loser</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thereby.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">His gold was accepted and paper given to him in exchange at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">banks, and for this Erik purchased real estate ; that at least was something</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which was not artificial and which in spite of any financial revolution would,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">within certain limits, retain its value. The earth meant bread, and bread</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">meant life.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The chemist, Erik Poulsen, consequently became a landed proprietor in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Euenen, owner of houses in Copenhagen and of property in foreign countries.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He appointed a manager to look after all this, as well as the factory in Roen-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ninghof, which he upon a sudden impulse had purchased, by securing all the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shares. The manager was instructed not to mention the name of the owner,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at least for the present. When Erik had thus made certain that he would not,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as he expressed it, get into trouble on account of a little chloride of platinum,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he considered that the time for making public announcement of his discovery</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had come.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">One day he sauntered down to his old professor's residence--Director</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dickmann of the Polytechnicum, and editor of the Danish Chemical Times.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">That was the man he wanted ; he had a reputation in scientific circles. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had one grave fault, however--a predilection for clubs and a good glass of</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">beer. In answer to his knock an irritated voice at last called out ' ' Come in ! "</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Professor Dickmann reclined on a lounge, puffing at a cigar. The daily paper</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lay on the table, and next to that was a half empty bottle of beer. Below</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the lounge could be seen another " battery " of about ten full bottles of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">same beverage. When the professor heard footsteps he simply turned his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">head.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Oh, it's you, Poulsen ? Be so good as to take a chair," he said.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Professor," began Erik, without any further circumlocution, but with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the respectful tone of old times, although he knew it would be only a question</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of saying one word to attain the popularity of ten such professors, " I have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">made a great discovery."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The answer Erik had hoped for came not ; the professor simply grunted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">quietly, and paid not the slightest attention to his visitor's words.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I have discovered howto convert base metals into gold," Erik continued,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">laying stress on each word.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A second grunt, but now sounding rather contemptuous, came from the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">professor, who grasped his beer glass and emptied it. He replaced the glass</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slowly on the table, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, murmured,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" You don't say so," took up his daily paper and began to read.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Professor, it is neither a joke nor an absurdity; I have really made that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">discovery," exclaimed Erik, becoming excited.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Oh, by the way, Poulsen," replied the professor, without glancing at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Erik, " would not a glass of soda do you good ? There is some in the corner</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there ; help yourself."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Erik pretended not to have heard. He drew a small phial from his pocket</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and noisily placed it on the table before the professor. " Do you see that ?"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he asked.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The professor quietly took the bottle, examined it, and shook its contents.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Hm, yes," he remarked carelessly, " I see very well that it is amorphous</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gold ; but you do not mean to tell me that you shook that out of an old</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Nothing else? Listen, Poulsen, I want to tell you something. You</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">may be a very bright fellow, but if you are under the impression that I have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">taken any more than is good for me this morning, then you are decidedly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">barking up the wrong tree. Go and see my colleague Rasmussen ; he'll</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">swallow the tale whole."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The professor having thus plainly indicated his utter unbelief in his caller's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">statement, lazily turned his back. Erik's face flushed ; he was nonplussed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and discomfited for a moment, and finally decided that it was superfluous to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">venture any additional information. " Adieu, professor," he said, smiling</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to himself now; * ' we will perhaps speak of the matter some other time ; then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">perhaps you will be less incredulous."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" The devil !" answered the professor; " we want optical and palpable</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">evidence in such matters. ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">When Erik reached the street, he was irresolute as to his next step. His</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">first thought was to call on Professor Rasmussen, but would it be to any pur-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">pose ? He had been angry at Professor Dickmann for a few moments, but he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">soon forgot the unpleasantness. All the world knew what he was, prominent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">though he had once been among scientists. No, to waste a thought on that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">matter was ridiculous. Erik determined to visit the Dania Bank, then to de-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">scribe his discovery in a pamphlet, publish it, and mail copies to every scientific</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">society in the world ; that was the proper course--the only sensible one.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">With energetic steps and erect bearing, Erik proceeded on his walk. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">street was bathed in clear, beautiful sunlight; he felt exalted--felt himself</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on a higher plane than his surroundings, and his spirit of pride once thor-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">oughly aroused, he walked so briskly that he soon found difficulty in breath-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing. He felt that he was in the foremost rank among the leading men of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">world.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Accidentally his glances were arrested by a Hebrew strutting along, clad in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an extremely rich fur coat, and this Hebrew eyed Erik with an aggravatingly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">superior mien. Could that individul only realize who the man was whom he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">passed so contemptuously ? Erik smiled to himself when he thought of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">panic he had it in his power to create on the stock exchange, did he desire it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">--why, it would be like striking between an army of ants with a stick--they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would be scattered, like chaff.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He arrived at the bank, presented his card, and requested to see the privy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">councilor, Espensen. After a moment's delay, Erik was in his presence.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was a small, pedantic gentleman with a well kept gray goatee, and wear-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing a stiff, high, old fashioned white collar and stock. He greeted Erik</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">politely and desired to know his wishes.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Certain rumors regarding Erik had become current in financial circles.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The public wished to ascertain from what source his wealth had come, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the surmises somehow would not agree. Some said that he had won large</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sums in the foreign lotteries, others claimed that he had inherited money from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an uncle who had died in South America, a millionaire, but others again</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">asserted that Erik had been gold hunting in California and experienced won-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">derful luck. How else could he have obtained the massive gold bars which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he supplied to the banks ?</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On the other hand it was a positive fact, that he had been chemist at a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">factory in Roeuningshof ; had he assumed this position only to discover for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">himself how the business paid, before purchasing the company's stock ? (In</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spite of all the secrecy maintained, the fact that Erik owned the factory had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leaked out.) These things would not harmonize when put together, and peo-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ple knew not what to think. Undoubtedly, however, he was a very wealthy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man, to whom the greatest attention was due, no matter whence his wealth</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">came.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">For this reason privy councilor Espensen was the perfection of politeness.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The privy councilor's countenance assumed its benign expression again.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Certainly. You will pardon my misunderstanding you, even though for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a second. The gold is critically tested before being accepted by the bank,</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Oh, now I comprehend," the councilor rejoined; "you mean to say that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">you obtained it from a kind of gold ore or gold salts--as I believe it is called</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in chemistry? And you found this salt in the earth, as only a chemist can ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this is very interesting. May I ask whether this was in California ? '</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The privy councilor raised his eyebrows in astonishment and stared fixedly</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the councilor's eyes wandered away. Irresolution as to what to say pic-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tured itself in his looks, and an extremely painful pause ensued. " My dear</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sir," the councilor went on at length, attempting to assume a very severe</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">look, " are you serious ? Positively serious ? ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Yes," Erik answered, "I am, and I will offer to give you the evidence</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">While they proceeded to the place designated, Erik attempted to open a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">conversation, but was unsuccessful. The councilor replied politely, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">evasively and reservedly, while he at times surveyed Erik sharply with side-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">long glances. Arrived at the laboratory, Erik was conducted to a small</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">though he must hold fast to something. The room whirled around him ; it</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the floor the ceiling ! And yet ! Was his discovery worth no more than a king-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A chair noisily shoved recalled him to his surroundings, and he saw that</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So saying, the chancellor bowed and left the room.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Erik went his way in a complete daze. He, the son of a mechanic, had had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a crown offered to him ! It was not a dream ; he was actually walking the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">streets of Berlin, and had just left one of the great men of Europe, who had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shaken hands with him in the friendliest manner, and offered him a throne.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">If he stretched out his hand to take the scepter, however, it meant eternal</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">silence in regard to his discovery, which would become the property of an-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">other. Germany would buy cannon therewith, and conquer the whole world.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">And when the whole world was made tributary to Germany, how could in-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">significant Bulgaria continue to exist ? What was to prevent Germany from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">taking back what it had just presented to him ?</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Erik roused himself and straightened up. He looked about him, and saw</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the multitudes in carriages, on horseback and foot, streaming past him. Ah,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">now he saw it all clearly. These masses would gape at him open mouthed if</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he, the citizen, were to be placed on a throne. Such a thing had occurred</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">before. But how quickly would it all be forgotten when the citizen was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">back in their ranks again ! Who would know of him a hundred years hence ?</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">A few historians might perhaps tell the story on account of its peculiarity--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">how a German statesman, for a whim, made a low class citizen a king over an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">unimportant strip of land, and later, when the joke had gone far enough,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">struck the crown from his head ; that would be all.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It took but little foresight to see to whom the arrangement would be most</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">advantageous. But the chancellor was not to triumph. If history was to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">contain his--Erik Poulsen's--name, after a thousand years, he preferred to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be chronicled as the man who had despised the offer of a crown.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly Erik felt some one tugging at his arm. His wife had started to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">meet him, being too nervous to wait for his return. She saw at once that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">something extraordinary had occurred.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" What did the chancellor wish ? " she asked, falling into step with him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Erik tried hard to appear calm and collected.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" He offered the throne of Bulgaria to me for my discovery," he replied</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with an assumed indifference. His wife gave one spasmodic tug at his arm,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and stood still as though transfixed. She looked at him steadily.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" And what did you say ?" she asked breathlessly.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Nothing as yet; I wished to consider matters and talk them over with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">you. Perhaps he calculates that you, as a woman, will be vain enough to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">induce me to give an affirmative reply ; but don't you think there is only one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">answer to make ? "</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">She looked straight before her, preoccupied, while he explained his reasons</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for declining the offer. To refuse a crown was equal to taking one, and the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">whether he would or not--could he keep silent forever ? Whatever offer the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">future might bring he would have only one answer. There was a ring in his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">words which also enthused his wife and caused her to look up to him admir-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ingly. A new, overwhelming feeling of the responsibilities and the duties</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">incumbent upon the wife of a great man, awakened within her.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The one whom she had chosen as master of her heart had been selected</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by fate for something still higher ; to be the most powerful man in the world,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">because it had made him the master of the greatest power governing the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">when he had penetrated the secret of that substance he himself became king,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and now her heart bowed before him and she paid homage to him--her king.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Erik read her thoughts in her eyes, and on reaching the hotel sat down at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the writing table to reply to the chancellor. He made no attempt at stating</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">any reason for his negative answer, and his letter contained nothing else than</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">That same evening Erik and his wife prepared to leave the city. Their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">destination was an uncertainty to themselves as yet. There certainly was no</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They had no cause to regret their prompt decision ; they had hardly</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">knocked at their door and notified them that their presence in the city had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been found "objectionable," and that they had been expelled from Prussia ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they were told to leave Berlin within twelve hours.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Berlin has also become very objectionable to me ! " replied Erik, bowing</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He now regretted that he had not at once proceeded there. If he had a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and if the world were to collapse over his head, he would be true to his voca-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">earnestly for quite a while, making many gestures, and pointing from time to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The Arabs and Somalis quickly pulled themselves upon their camels, and</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">No resistance was made. The Hindoo soldiers were in a state of deep</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The caravan was now ready to start. At the last minute Makar Makalo</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">passed carelessly by Guy and whispered, "Keep good heart. Makar no</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">them on their way, the line of camels filed at a slow trot over the sandy plain</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He was a cunning knave and had laid his plans well. Perhaps he feared</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">not allow this to trouble him much. Makar's last words were still ringing in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">In the first excitement Guy and Melton had escaped notice, but now they</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">passions to the highest pitch of ferocity. The foreigners' presence in the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">surged round the group. At last so great was the crush, the camels were</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But every instant the situation was becoming more critical. The mob grew</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">The Englishmen were saved. A compact body of men in linen tunics</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Guy and the Arab mounted a fresh camel, first putting the wounded</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The first sight of Harar was novel and interesting. Before them was a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">dimly seen the northern wall of the town. This avenue was like a barren</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mountain road, strewn with rubbish and heaps of rocks, and the dwellings</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which rose on all sides to the height of two stories, were, many of them, con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">structed of sandstone and granite, cemented with a reddish clay. They were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">impressively gloomy and dingy.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The terrible scene just enacted had terrorized the people. Many Arabs</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">came flocking across the streets and exchanged greetings with the newcomers,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but very few Somalis or Gallas were to be seen. The sight of the Emir's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">guard seemed to have stricken the town like a palsy. The shops and booths</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were closed and deserted. The curtains of the houses were closely drawn ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">here and there at the doors lay goods that had been dropped in the sudden</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">panic, and at one place a man lay dead across the threshold still clutching in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his stiffened fingers a bunch of brightly colored rugs.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But now the scene became animated and lively; people flocked out from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their houses, among them many women, whom Guy regarded curiously, for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they seemed to be of quite a different type from the men, and passably good</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">looking. They made no demonstration, however, but very quietly followed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the caravan.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The center of the town was now close at hand, and a short distance</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ahead, on the left hand side, rose a more imposing abode than those around</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it. It was built of granite, and above the flat roof rose a square tower with</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">circular windows. It boasted a spacious courtyard, inclosed by a low stone</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">parapet, and within this space were a dozen armed guards, clad in leopard</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">skin caps, and bearing brightly polished rifles.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was the palace of the Kmir, and as the caravan drew up to the gates</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the escort sounded a blast of trumpets, and almost immediately the doors</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were opened and a grave and dignified Arab came slowly out.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He spoke a few words to the leader of the caravan, who dismounted at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">once, and bidding Guy follow him, entered the courtyard. Close behind him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">came Melton, borne by the soldiers.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Passing between the guards, they entered a narrow vestibule hung with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rich curtains, and in a moment more were ushered into the dreaded presence</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of Rao Khan.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The Emir was seated on a low dais at the further side of a spacious</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">apartment. The first glance struck terror to Guy's heart. Rao Khan was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">short, thickset man, with a round, smooth face. His eyes were sunken</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">deeply under the forehead, and the expression of his face was a strange</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blending of brutality, avarice, and treachery. He was simply clad in white</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">linen, with a great sword at his side, and on his head was a leopard skin cap,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so constructed that the tail of the leopard hung down his back.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Before him squatted four solemn faced Arabs. The floor was spread with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rugs and the skins of various animals, and on the heavily curtained walls</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hung a dazzling array of every description, bronze and copper shields, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">strips of oddly woven tapestry. At sight of the English flag which the Arab</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">now produced, the Emir's eyes sparkled, his face lit up with fiendish joy, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he began to talk wildly in a strange tongue.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The Arab replied, giving him no doubt an account of the insurrection,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the names Berbera, Zaila, and Makar Makalo were frequently mentioned.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Guy, from his position at Melton's side, who had been placed on a soft</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lion skin, watched the strange scene with wonder. He was more worried at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">present about Melton than anything else. The spear wound had not yet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been dressed, and the poor fellow was in too much pain even to talk.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At last the Arab turned round, and, pointing to the Englishmen, spoke in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a low tone to the Emir, who half rose from his seat and looked sharply at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the captives.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Guy met his gaze calmly and steadily. In a moment the suspense would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be over, and their fate would be decided one way or the other.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The Emir's reply was brief and apparently forcible. He clapped his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hands, and half a dozen soldiers appeared instantly. He addressed them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a word or two, but before they could execute his orders, Guy hastened</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forward and said to the Arab, " I pray you have my friend's wound dressed.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He is suffering much pain."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The Arab addressed the Emir, pointing to the wounded nan, and then</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">ward, and picking Melton up, motioned Guy to follow them. They passed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out of the apartment by a rear door, and traversing a long hall, entered a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">big courtyard.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On the right and left were high stone walls, and directly opposite was a</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Here were standing more armed guards, who obsequiously opened the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As they passed through the gloomy portal Guy's heart sank. His eyes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at first could see nothing but darkness, and he blindly followed his conductors</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">until they came to a stop. A heavy door was closed and bolted behind him,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then all was silent.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In a few seconds he was able to see his surroundings. He was in a square</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dungeon, lighted by a narrow aperture high up in the wall. The floor was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of stone, strewn with straw. Melton sat up and leaned against the wall.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Where are we, Chutney ? " he asked.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I don't know," answered Guy ; "in some sort of a prison, I suppose.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Why--hello, Melton, here are iron rings sunk in the floor all along the side."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" That settles it, then," rejoined Melton. "This is Rao Khan's slave</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prison. I don't suppose there are many inmates now while the fair is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">going on. ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Approaching footsteps put an end to the conversation, and in a moment</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the door opened to admit a tall Arab, followed by a native with bandages</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and a basin of water.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The Arab quietly loosened Melton's shirt and coat, and washing the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wound, wrapped bandages round his body spread with some soft ointment.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He did the work speedily and dexterously, and then departed as silently as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had come. He had barely gone, however, when a soldier entered with a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tray containing dates, figs, and a peculiar kind of cakes, which he placed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">before the prisoners. They ate with relish, and then overcome by weariness,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they lay down on the straw and fell asleep.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was some hours later when Guy woke. Night had come, for no light</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shone through the aperture. He lay for some time listening to Melton's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">deep breathing and thinking of their terrible situation.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was not without hope of deliverance, for he placed a great deal of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">faith i'i Makai 's promise ; yet even then the chances were against them.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Perhaps at this very moment Zaila had been retaken' and Makar was killed or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a prisoner. If this should happen they were lost. Guy shuddered to think</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of Rao Khan's vengeance under such circumstances.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Presently he became aware of vague noises somewhere in the distance.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He fancied he heard shots fired and a loud tumult of voices.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He thought it might be imagination, but suddenly the sounds increased,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and once or twice footsteps hurried past the dungeon. The noise now woke</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Melton, and together they listened, convinced that it was a presentiment of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">coming evil. The strange sounds rose and fell, at times nearly dying away</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then bursting out with renewed violence.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I can't understand it at all," said Guy. " It can't be a rejoicing over</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was right. A howling mob was on all sides of them now, and it was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">suddenly half a dozen shots were fired as though the guards were resisting</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was a period of terrible suspense. The shouts increased, the firing grew</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heavier, powder smoke drifted into the prison, and just when they expected</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to see their dungeon door torn open by a mad swarm of fanatics, the uproar</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suddenly ceased.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A full minute of silence followed, and then on the night air rose a howl</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of triumph, so savage, so vindictive, that Guy and Melton shivered from head</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to foot. For some reason the attack had been suddenly abandoned. What</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that reason was they could only surmise.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The silence continued. The invaders had dispersed. Sleep was impos-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sible, and they passed the time in conversation until a streak of light, flicker-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing through the opening, showed that morning had come.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Food and drink were brought in. The prisoners ate sparingly. The</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"I am just as sure," said Melton, " that something will shortly happen,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Footsteps approached. The door creaked and opened, and a man entered.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">With a cry of wonder Guy and Melton sprang to their feet. The newcomer</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was bronzed and burnt, he had light hair, a mustache and a soft blond</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beard, but he wore trousers and a tunic of white linen.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The surprise was mutual. The stranger scanned them closely from head</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Who are you ?" cried Guy hoarsely. " Can it be possible that you are</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The man paused a moment and then said quietly, "I am a Greek.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">An embarrassing pause now occurred. It was certain that the Greek was</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I left Cairo for Calcutta," said Canaris. "The steamer was lost off</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Cape Guardafui ; ten of us reached shore in a boat ; the Somalis slaughtered</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">scarcely gone when an insurrection broke out. The people were angered at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the slaughter done by the Emir's troops when they rescued you from the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crowd. It is a law of ancient standing in Harar that every Christian stranger</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who enters her gates must die. Englishmen are most detested of all. The</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">very few remained faithful to the Emir. The mob surrounded the palace and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the prison ; they tried to scale the walls ; the guards in the court fired on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them. Then Rao Khan appeared and spoke to the angry crowd. He begged</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">difficulties to be overcome seemed insurmountable. They must escape from</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the wall, and then--where were they ? Hundreds of miles from the coast,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">geon. Once a horrible thought entered Guy's mind. What was to prevent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the Greek from making his escape alone, and abandoning the Englishmen to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their fate ? It was but momentary, however, and then he dismissed the sus-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">picion with a feeling of shame. He had already learned to trust the Greek</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Crouched by their dungeon door, they listened by the hour, and at last</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their patience was rewarded. Voices were heard, steps approached and died</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Melton threw himself on the straw and moaned. Guy rapped sharply on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the door, and waited in suspense. Almost instantly it opened, and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">guard, a tall Nubian, pushed his lamp into the doorway, and followed it up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with his head and shoulders.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Canaris, Canaris ! " said Guy earnestly, pointing to Melton, who</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">at some places even tents were to be seen. Laughter and loud talking came</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from open windows. Two or three fierce looking Somali warriors stalked</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">father. He thought his rich parent was very unreasonable, and declared</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that he would have a steamer. The battle with the son had followed that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">be more accommodating. This was touching the magnate in his most tender</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spot, but he regarded it as an idle threat; for surely his son could not seri-</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">so. He rushed out of the house, desperately angry because his father denied</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his request. He forgot all about the row boats, the sail boats, the ponies,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and other gifts, and condemned his parent for this one failure to gratify his</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Phin wondered if he had not, by some special. inspiration, brought the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the conversation, and when he saw his father take the keys, he considered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the question of the purchase of the steamer settled. He watched his father</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Barkpool was busy thinking of something else, and he gave very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">little attention to the keys, or to the call of the cashier. The dam was gone,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and though he had an engine and coal enough to run it for a few days, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had no engineer ; he had just discharged him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was sure that some enemy had blown up the dam in the interests of Sin-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">destroyed, the only thing that would satisfy him was to have his mill running</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the next morning as usual. Such a triumph was worth some humiliation,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and he started at once for the cottage of Morgan Lamb.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">for him in his efforts to quiet his nerves. The liquor made him sleepy, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he went to bed. He dropped into a deep slumber at once. Phin, who had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">retired, dressed himself, and obtained the keys, for his father had not thought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of them again. He went to the bank, opened it, and lighted a lamp.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">With the keys in his possession, he had no difficulty in opening the vault,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">search for the bank bills before he was startled by a noise in the banking</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">room. But he concluded that it had been made by a rat, or by the wind</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He found the drawer which contained the bills, and he had begun to take</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">him. He tried to scream, but his assailant stuffed a handkerchief into his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mouth. In another minute, he saw the barrels of a revolver confronting</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It goes without saying that Dolph was sorry he had undertaken the job,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The sight of the revolver, within a foot of his head, had thoroughly subdued</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">overbearing and saucy to his father. The two robbers, after they had tied</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his hands behind him, took no further notice of him, but returned to the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">As soon as they were at a convenient distance from him Dolph began to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">he closed as soon as the prisoner was secured, and the room was as black as</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">nothing but a faint light in the vault, for the operators had partly closed the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doors. Dolph rolled his body a little way, and then thought he could get</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up ; at any rate, he decided to make the attempt. It was not an easy thing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to rise from the floor when bound as he was, as any one may know by</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">not yet quite got his " sea legs" off, and decided that it would be safer as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">well as more comfortable in the car. He had brought a novel with him ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">now that there was no motion he could read without discomfort to his eyes.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He returned to his seat, and as he settled himself back, with his head</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">resting on the plush, he thought with a sense of security that he was glad he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had seen that brakeman go back with his lantern.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He opened his book and began to read. The story, which he had picked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up hap hazard on the news stand in the waiting room at the Grand Central,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seemed singularly appropriate. It opened with the return of the lover after</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a year's absence. He rings the bell at the home of the betrothed, inquires</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for her, and the servant looks blank.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Cadwalader never read any further than that. A crash sounded in his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ears, and then he was conscious of no other sensation until he heard a canary</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bird singing.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He held his eyes closed for an instant longer to take in to the fullest</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">man looked about him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">All was strange. He was in bed, but where he knew not. And what</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was stranger still, this ignorance seemed to cause him no concern. He lay</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there blissfully enjoying the comfort of the couch, and watching, with the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">interest of a child, the flickering sunshine as it came through the bowed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shutters and disported itself in fantastic shapes on the wall paper.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He heard the murmur of voices in another room. They were very soft,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sweet voices. He wondered if it could be his mother and Cousin Kate talk-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing. He remembered now what had happened to him to give him this sort</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of stunned sensation in the back of his head. The great bob sled he and his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chum Harry Clark had built had run into Alonzo Peterman's farm</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wagon, and he, Will, must have been pretty badly hurt. But this house</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">didn't seem like home. Perhaps, though, the doctors had thought it danger-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ous to have him moved far, and he had been carried into a neighbor's.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He had just arrived at this conclusion when the murmur of voices in the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">kept his eyes fastened on her as she approached the bed. He thought she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen. And yet she was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stranger to him. He wrinkled his brow in a frown, trying to place her.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">She noticed the movement and hurried forward with the question, ' ' Are</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He shook his head and looked up into her face with a smile on his own.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"You are looking much better today," she said. "Won't you let me</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He drew his left hand out from under the bed clothes. A thrill went</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">through him when she took his wrist between her dainty fingers.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Yes, very encouraging," she responded.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">She relaxed the clasp, and in his weak state his hand dropped, chancing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to brush close by his face. In doing so he felt something strange. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lifted his hand again and passed it across his upper lip, covered by his blond</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mustache.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A look of perplexity, of horror almost, came into his eyes. He gave a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sort of groan, dropped his hand, and great beads of perspiration came out on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his forehead. His poor brain, twisted all askew by the blow on the head he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">received in the collision, was at sea again. He thought he had placed him-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">self right in putting himself back in boyhood. He could remember nothing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beyond that point. Had he lost his own identity entirely, and was he not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Will Cadwalader at all?</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He made« mighty effort of mind to comprehend the mystery, but it was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">too deep for him. He raised himself in the bed for an instant, gave a look</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">around the room, then an agonized, pleading one into the face of her who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stood by his side, and fell back on the pillow again in a swoon.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He w7as conscious that tender hands administered to him, that the soft,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sweet voice he had already heard spoke of him as ' ' poor fellow ! I wish that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we might help him," and then he slept, to wake again with a light burning</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the room and a young man sitting by the bedside and looking fixedly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Good," exclaimed the latter, as Cadwalader opened his eyes. "You</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Where am I ? " was the other's only response to this. He knitted his</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"In my house, Dr. Raymond's, in Tarrytown."</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Tarrytown?" repeated Cadwalader, the look of perplexity deepening on</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Yes, don't you remember the railroad accident? You were hurt; very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">badly. For days you were quite unconscious. I had you brought straight</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I am a physician, you know. You remember now, do you not? "</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" A railroad accident? " repeated the other. " Ah, perhaps you thought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it was the cars that did it. We ran into Alonzo's wagon near the track. And</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Harry ? Tell me, was he hurt as badly as I was? "</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then, before the other could answer, he went on, the wild look coming</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">this "--he drew his finger swiftly across his mustache, then put up his other</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hand to feel the week's growth of beard upon his chin--" I can't under-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But Cadwalader did not sleep for hours after that. He seemed like one who,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">while yet having a body endowed with breath and all the functions for living,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was yet without a soul--that inner consciousness that tells a man who he is,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and gives him a place in the community. For now even the memory of his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">own name had gone from him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Again and again he tried to recall the railroad accident of which he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been told ; but the only recollection he had of the cars was when he and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Harry Clark had gone to the Adirondacks one summer and camped out. If</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he could only see Harry, perhaps all would come straight again. But</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Tarrytown !</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">That place was miles from home, down by New York, a city in which he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had never been. Oh, it was all a horrible mystery, a nightmare ! Perhaps</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">if he waited, as the other had said, the mist would clear away.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was towards morning when he finally fell asleep ; and when he woke</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">again, it was to hear once more that bird singing and see the golden shafts of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Cadwalader turned his head at the sound of the voice whose 'sweetness he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had already remarked. She was arranging a tempting repast on a little table</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Could he feel drawn so closely to another as he was now to her ? But he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">might not be married. The chances were all against it, it seemed to him.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was now more eager than ever to regain full control of his mind. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">very fact that he was beginning to feel the strangeness, the ignominy of his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A robin, alighting on a branch just over his head, began to sing raptur-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">such bird song before. But his memory would carry him no further back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">than the canary at the Raymonds', whose notes were the first sounds that</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was a bench at the lower end of the garden. He tottered to this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and flung himself upon it. Just then a whistle sounded close at hand. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">railroad, as has been said, ran past the foot of the Raymond garden. A train</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from New York had just come in. There was some delay on the track ahead.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It slowed up and came to a standstill with one of the parlor cars just the other</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Cadwalader raised his head and looked, languidly at first, at the passengers</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gazing from the windows. All at once the languor left him ; a strange, in-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">explicable expression flashed into his face. He rose to his feet and began to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">move toward the hedge, his eyes fixed on a face at one of the car windows.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">With a rush everything came back to Cadwalader. As if growing out of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">trembling of the mighty ship under his feet. He remembered all now. He</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">the next second was out of sight. Cadwalader stood there in the same posi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion, looking after it. It seemed to him as if he had just been born again</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">after death. Every fact connected with his last conscious moment as Will</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But with the thought of her the look of happiness left his face. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">image that kept coming up in his brain when he pictured his betrothed was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">always that of her whom he had first looked upon when returning conscious-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ness came to him. He wished that he might see her now, so that he could</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But no, 110. He must never see her again ; he wras afraid he could not</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He went back into the house and waited impatiently for Dr. Ray-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Cadwalader determined not to wait for him. He felt now that every hour</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he remained in this house estranged him further from Edna. He wrote a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">note to the doctor, explaining how memory had returned to him and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">announcing that he had gone to Peekskill, but would be back in a day or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two to return the clothes, and so forth. Then he went off to the station and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">telegraphed to New York for his trunks. He thought of sending a message</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to Edna, but recollecting that she could not have expected him yet, decided</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that he would surprise her. But when he tried to imagine what form</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of expression this surprise would take on her face, it was always the face of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Raymond's cousin he saw.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">And during the entire ride to Peekskill this same face kept itself steadily</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">before his mental vision. In vain he argued with himself on the absurdity</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of being in love with a woman whose name he did not know. By the time</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he reached his destination he was utterly miserable--desperate almost.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mechanically he inquired of the station master how to reach the Deering</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">residence; then he went out and made his way into the town.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He had not far to go. He saw Mrs. Deering looking at him from an</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it was strange that she did not throw up her hands wdth an exclamation of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">surprise, and hurry down to meet him. Then it came over him that of course</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">she did not recognize him with his mustache.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" And Edna?" he thought then. " Will her love inform her who it is?"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Again came the vision of that other face between. Must he always be</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">at the gate. She saw him, too, and a strange look came into her face as she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hurried forward. She opened the door, and came into the parlor.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">Norbert gave them his written instructions as to the amount of labor he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">for use. Norbert was rather disturbed in his calculations by this sudden</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">six miles long is selected and the passengers are sent off in two boats. At the last moment Sibyl</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Stanley is detained from accompanying her friends, Williams arguing that she must be held to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">insure Ned's trustworthiness. Captain Blake and Manners are landed on another island, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">soon afterwards the Flying Cloud is put in at a third one, having a safe harbor between tall cliffs,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">with a canoe containing Captain Blake and Rob Manners, and there is great rejoicing over the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">They plan also to build a cutter, in which to escape, and after the laying of the keel Captain</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Blake goes fishing on the raft, is overtaken by a hurricane, and is given up for lost by his friends.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">They proceed with the building of their boat, which is almost completed when Grant and Percy</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Be this as it may, the moment of the proa's arrival in the river was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a most unfortunate one for the occupants of the punt, who were seen and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chased by the Malaj^s the instant that their vessel rounded the point.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Grant at once saw that escape for himself as well as for the children was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">impossible ; he was as near Grant Island as he was to the main, and in which-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ever direction he headed he must inevitably be overtaken before he could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">make good his retreat, and with his usual promptitude he at once decided</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to continue his course for the islet, hoping to be able to make a sufficiently</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">long stand against the enemy to permit of the children gaining the safe refuge</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the fort.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was hailed as soon as seen ; but, of course, the only notice he took of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this was to urge the clumsy, heavy punt with redoubled speed through the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">water. Finding him so contumacious, the Malays then fired upon him several</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">times, and succeeded in slightly wounding him in the head.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As the proa advanced further up the stream, and drew closer and closer</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">still, in under the lee of the high land, the wind grew light and shy with her,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then, perhaps fearing that after all their prey might escape them, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crew hastily launched a boat and gave chase in her.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But for that unlucky wound in the head, it is possible that Grant might</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have succeeded in his plucky effort; but though the bullet inflicted but little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">actual damage, the blow stunned and dazed him so that for a minute or two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he scarcely knew where he was or what he was doing. Trifling as was the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">amount of time thus lost, it was sufficient to ruin what little chance he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">originally had ; for when the punt at length grounded with a shock on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sandy beach of the creek, the Malays were' scarcely a dozen yards astern of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her, and Grant had only just time to lift the j^oungsters out on the sand, to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">give the hasty injunction, "Run away home, children, as fast as ever you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">can," and to seize an oar in self defense, when the enemy--nine of them--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were upon him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Of course, armed as he was with no better weapon than a. clumsy oar, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had no chance whatever against such overwhelming odds, and, though he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">managed to fell three of his antagonists, the fight had not lasted two min-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">utes before his arms were pinioned from behind, his feet tripped from under</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him, and himself made a prisoner. He was quickly rolled over on his face,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and his arms securely lashed behind him, when, this being satisfactorily</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">accomplished, his captors raised him to his feet, and, conducting him to a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tree, firmly bound him to its trunk.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The idea then seemed to occur to the Malays that possibly the children</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">might not yet be beyond the reach of capture, for two of them set off at a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and of the fleetness of foot displayed by their cruel pursuers when starting</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Yes, dear boy, yes. It is for your own good that I tell you to do this,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">answered Grant brokenly, for he keenly felt the unspoken reproach which he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saw in the child's eyes as the little fellow forlornly turned away and with a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">piteous sob quietly surrendered himself to the brute, who now again with</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Oh, don't ! you hurt me so!" the poor little fellow suddenly screamed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">he saw the cruel clutch with which the wretch was digging his long, thin,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sinewy fingers into the tender flesh of the boy's shoulder as he forced him to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an adjoining tree, to which he forthwith proceeded to lash him, drawing the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cord so tightly round the slender wrists that the little fellow fairly screamed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with the intolerable pain.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Curse you ! " yelled Grant, now fairly stung to madness and foaming at</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">forth words of rage and defiance he tugged and strained with such super-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">human strength upon his bonds that the stout rope fairly cracked whilst it</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to exert his strength effectively, and at length, completely exhausted, he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fain to desist, to the undisguised delight of a little knot of the Malays who</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">muttered word or two, he proceeded to loosen them sufficiently to relieve the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The loosening of his bonds afforded the poor child so much relief that he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">now felt almost comfortable, comparatively speaking; and, exhausted with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the pain and terror he had already endured, he soon sank into a kind of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stupor, which, if it did not amount to actual insensibility, approached it so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nearly as to afford the poor little fellow at least a temporary forgetfulness of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">For as he now had leisure to reflect, the future, so far as they two were</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">his child to the mercy of the Malays without making some attempt at a res-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Malay loss would doubtless be very heavy ; and he had heard quite enough of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their vindictive: nature to feel assured they would take their revenge upon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him and Percy. Yes, the more he thought about it, the more convinced did</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Well," he murmured, "God's will be done." It was best, perhaps,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">himself, if he could but be satisfied that the little fellow's death was quick</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and easy, he cared not how soon he followed him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As he cogitated painfully over this problem he saw a party of twelve</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Malays detach themselves from the rest and move off in the direction of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fort. Then after a considerable interval came the sounds of firing, followed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some twenty minutes later by the return of four only put of the twelve.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A sickening fear came over Grant at first that those in the fort had suc-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cumbed to the attack, and that the eight absentees were remaining behind in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">charge of the prisoners. But a little reflection led him to believe that, had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">such been the case, the prisoners would have been brought in triumph to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Malay camp.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Could it be possible then, he asked himself, that the missing eight had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fallen in the attack ? It might be so. The bearing of the four who had re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turned was anything but triumphant ; and there was a great deal of excited</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">talk and gesticulation on their part, seemingly in the nature of an explana-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion, and more excited talk among the others, followed, after a long and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stormy debate, by the preparation and despatch of the letter, the delivery of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which we witnessed in the preceding chapter.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This last act of the Malays completely reassured Grant as to the safety of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the fort and its inmates, but it also confirmed him in his belief that his own</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">And at the same instant the ropes which bound him suddenly slackened</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">happened to be nearest the hawse pipe. The job occupied them fully a quar-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" So far, so good," said Ned. " Now, Price, I want you to take the glass</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">slowly stern foremost toward the outer basin. So long as we see no sign of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">alarm from the people on shore, I shall let her drift; that will increase our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chances of a good start. But the moment you see any indication of an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">attempt to launch a boat, give me the word ; and we must then get the jib on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the ship and put her head round. There is a fine breeze blowing, and if we</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">With the aid of the winch the two men succeeded in getting the main</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This, however, was not fast enough to suit Ned, for, though they had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">secured a capital start, and he conjectured that the pursuers were too thor-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">oughly intoxicated to be capable of pulling a boat at any very great speed, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knew that at the southwestern extremity of the outer basin they would reach</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This consisted of a channel only half a mile in width by about a mile and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">distinctly gaining upon him.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" If they have no'firearms with them," said Ned to Price, " I think we</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">deck and load a few of those rifles from the arm chest, for having gone so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">far it will never do now for us to allow ourselves to be taken. Get the keys</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the arm chest and magazine, Joe, and bring up a couple of dozen rifles</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The rifles were brought on deck and loaded carefully, half of them being</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stacked in the waist of the ship, whilst the other half, with a liberal supply</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The ship being under fore and aft canvas only, this alteration in her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">course was a disadvantage rather than otherwise, the staysails refusing to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stand properly ; moreover, the high land was now once more close aboard of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them on both quarters, rendering the wind light and shifty, in consequence</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of which the ship lost way perceptibly.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The ship was fully half way across the outer basin when the gig--the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leading boat--opened fire upon her. The weapon fired was evidently a rifle,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for though the boat was half a mile astern, Ned distinctly heard the whistle</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the bullet overhead, showing not only that they were well within the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">range of the piece, but also that it had been skilfully and steadily aimed, a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">circumstance which led him to conjecture that Williams, probably the only</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The ship being thus proved to be within range, Ned now took the wheel</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">himself, sending Sibyl below to the saloon, with instructions not to venture</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from thence out on deck until he should intimate to her that she could do so</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The sheets now had to be trimmed over, but the ship being found to steer</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">herself, this was not a matter of very great difficulty, Ned leaving the helm</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">His description of the contents of the cave, together with the exhibition</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">How to secure it was, however, the question--a question which Ned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">solved the moment he set eyes upon the Petrel. He proposed that she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">should at once be completed and launched, and that, whilst the rest of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">party should effect a leisurely removal of themselves and whatever they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wished to take with them on board the Flying Cloud, he, with Manners,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">should proceed in the cutter to Josh Williams' island, and, watching their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">opportunity, run in during the night, secure the treasure, and leave again</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">next morning--as they could easily manage to do--before the pirates could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gain an idea of their being at hand.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was a risky thing to attempt, certainly, though not nearly so risky as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it at first sight appears ; and after a full and exhaustive discussion of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chances for and against success the bold scheme was agreed to.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Accordingly, on the following morning all hands went to work with a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">will ; and they labored to such good purpose that the last finishing touches</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were put to the little craft on the Frida3r following, leaving nothing to be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">done on the Saturday but the actual launching, and such trimming of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ballast as might be found necessary when she was afloat.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The launch was effected successfully, the ceremony of christening being</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">performed by little Tucille ; and, it being found when the craft was afloat</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that only a very trifling alteration was necessary in the distribution of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ballast, the alteration was at once made, after which all hands repaired on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">board, sail was made, and they went outside to try the cutter's pacel The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">result was more than satisfactory--it was a delightful surprise ; for not only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in her seagoing powers, but also in the qualities of speed and weatherliness</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">did the Petrel far exceed the most sanguine anticipations of everybody, in-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cluding her designer. They worked to windward for about three hours and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then returned to the harbor, where the remainder of the day was spent in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">getting on board the provisions, water, and other necessaries for the projected</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On the following Monday the Petrel sailed for Island Harbor, with Ned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as skipper, and Manners as mate, cook, steward, and crew, all rolled into one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">--the adventurers receiving all sorts of cautions and good wishes as they said</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The course to be steered was northeast, or nearly dead to windward as the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">so it was calculated that the trip there and back would occupy about a week.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But no sooner were they fairly outside the harbor's mouth than Ned and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Manners exchanged the opinion that a smart little Weatherly fore and aft</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rigged craft like the Petrel ought to do the distance in considerably less than</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">extent that even Captain Blake would have remonstrated had he been with</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The craft, however, was stanch, the spars and rigging sound, the canvas</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">new ; and the youthful mariners, though daring, were by no means reckless.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The weather also was settled and the wind steady, if somewhat fresh. All,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">therefore, went well with them, and so thoroughly did the cutter answer the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">expectations of her crew, that at dawn on the Wednesday morning--the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">second day out--the high laud of Island Harbor was distinctly visible from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the deck, showing just above the horizon like a sharply defined purplish gray</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blot upon the sky to windward.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At the same time the adventurers also made out something else, to wit, a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fleet of five sail of small craft dead to windward--in fact, immediately between</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the cutter and the island.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At first they were considerably puzzled to determine the character of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">these small craft, which were steering due west ; but at length, as they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">closed and became more distinctly visible, Ned was enabled to solve the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">riddle. The fleet was none other than the boats belonging to the Flying</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ned conjectured that the hasty abandonment of Island Harbor, indicated</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by the appearance of the boats at sea, arose either from a fear that Ned might</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">give such information of the existence of the place as would lead to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">speedy capture of its occupants, or a determination on the part of the dis-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">comfited pirates to seek at sea a substitute for the noble ship of which they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had been so cleverly deprived.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Whichever--if either--of these surmises might have been the correct one,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a very lively interest in the movements of the Petrel was speedily manifested</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by the occupants of the boats, makeshift signals of distress being promptly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">displayed on each craft. Ned paid attention to these to the extent of closing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with the fleet sufficiently to enable him to establish their identity beyond</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">question, after which he calmly made arrangements to avoid them.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">When this was seen, the boats hauled up in pursuit, but they might as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">well have attempted to pursue the sea birds which hovered in their wake.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ned so maneuvered as to pass the nearest boat well out of rifle shot, at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">same time steering such a course as would be unlikely to excite any suspicion</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that he was bound to Island Harbor ; and though the pursuit was maintained</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for nearly an hour, its hopelessness had by that time become so apparent that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the boats again bore up and were soon afterward lost to view in the western</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">For the information of those interested in the ultimate fate of the pirates,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it may be as well to mention here that they were from that time never more</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was just noon that day when the Petrel entered the Narrows ; and</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This was an easy and expeditious task, the jars of gold dust and the gold</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Manners, who received them below. The casket with the remainder of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">declared to be of priceless value, was also taken, as were such of the shields</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and weapons as would bear handling--Grant and Henderson having expressed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a very particular wish to possess some of these, as quite unique curiosities.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But the ivory and the other bulky articles were left for the benefit of whom-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The shipment was completed in about three hours, after which Ned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">entered the inner basin and worked up as far as the anchorage, which spot</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Though nobody was to be seen, and the storehouses had all the appear-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ance of being completely abandoned, the voyagers were far too prudent to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">land--for which, indeed, there was no inducement--and, having satisfied</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their curiosity, they wore round and proceeded at once to sea, passing out</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Thirty six hours later, or about six o'clock on the following Friday morn-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">who--the entire party having removed on board the Flying Cloud--happened</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">up the shipwrecked crew of a New York ship, who were only too glad to ship</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the passage home, especially as Ned felt justified in offering them the top</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">scale of wages ; and the owners of the Cloud having been telegraphed to and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">letters written by all hands, advising their friends of their safety, sail was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">once more made, this time for New York direct. On the voyage home the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and a large one, could show such vim, and so it proved. After an exciting</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">water divides, part to go over the American Falls, and part to go over the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">this spot, they will ever experience the greatest possible immunity from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fishermen. The place was much farther down than we dared to venture.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">increased till I feared it would part. I began to pull in, slowly at first, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then more rapidly as our game seemed to become exhausted. My frieud and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I looked into the water beneath. The line seemed almost perpendicular, then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the boat passed over it. I was startled, and looked around. The hook had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">mingle and be lost with that of the cataract. " Row, row, row ! " I cried.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">struggle for life. I could do nothing but sit with bated breath, and watch</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his frantic efforts. Every moment was precious, and the idea of my taking</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">My friend was rowing with such a quick, powerful stroke that hope</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gradually came to me. With each pull the boat would seemingly rise to meet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the oncoming water, and then subside. I looked toward the shore. What</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could cause that peculiar seesaw of the trees ? I shuddered as I realized the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">explanation. Between the strokes the boat was carried down by the current</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">apparently as much as it was forced up stream by the efforts of the rower.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a very long time, as it seemed to me, I detected undeniable evidence that we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were gaining. Clear space could be seen between a tree and chimney that,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the beginning, had been outlined together against the sky. So much time,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and only a gain of ten or fifteen feet ! Would my friend ever bear up under</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I looked at him more attentively. Great beads of perspiration coursed</seg>
