O'Conor Sloane, Ph.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">E find ourselves in a peculiar dilemma in reference</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one class of stories for which so many of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">readers have expressed a preference. These stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall into the class of Interplanetary Travel and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dilemma is in this: Amazing Stories is de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voted to stories involving the many phases of</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural science. Of course, the word science means everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is known. It definitely means knowledge, and it is not too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to say that the commonest actions of our lives, if the mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">has any part in them, are scientific. But this is to a certain ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent begging the question, for what is usually meant by science,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and certainly what the readers of this magazine understand by</seg><seg type="columnLine">that word, is what is known as Natural Science, which can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended to include ethnology, or the study of the races of men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and philology or the study of languages, and many other such</seg><seg type="columnLine">topics. The effect of this is to give an extended range to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjects presented to our readers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to come back to interplanetary travel. If voyages were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be made from the earth to any of the planets, or even to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, the distances are so great that starting from rest as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">travelers would do, they would have to attain a high velocity in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very short space of time. Such a change of velocity, if in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of speed, is called positive acceleration, or more often</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply, acceleration. If velocity is checked and reduced, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">process is called negative acceleration. If a person were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter an elevator and it rushed down its shaft with evenly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing speed, so that at the end of a second it would be moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the rate of thirty-two feet per second, and at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next second at sixty-four feet a second, the weight of this person</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the elevator would disappear as far as the elevator is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned. If he jumped up in the air, he would strike his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the top of the elevator and would stay there. If there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a spring balance in the elevator and the person were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand upon it, instead of showing his normal weight, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be 150 lbs., it would show simply nothing. But suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he started at the foot of the shaft and stood upon the spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance: the instant the elevator began to _ move upward he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would show more than his normal weight, which would continue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show on the dial as long as the car increased its rate of mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Once the rate of motion ceased to increase, his normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight would show.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The point to be made is that weight is entirely dependent upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitation--that weight has nothing to do with acceleration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at the same time the effect of weight may be produced there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by. One of the great feats of baseball players--cited many times</seg><seg type="columnLine">--is the catching of a ball thrown from the top of the Washing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton Monument, which gives a fall of about 550 feet. This, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, brings it down very rapidly and when the catcher re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceives the ball on his glove, it will probably feel as though a</seg><seg type="columnLine">10-pound weight landed there. Of course that would only be</seg><seg type="columnLine">true for a fraction of a second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In interplanetary travel, where the travelers start from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">earth at a velocity of zero, that is to say from rest, the accelera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion must start and must be very rapid, so that the travelers will</seg><seg type="columnLine">press, not with weight alone, but with a combination of weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the force of positive acceleration against the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber in the projectile, or "ship," as it may be termed. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">this pressure wifi be so enormous that, in order to reach a planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or even to reach the moon in any reasonable time, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably be sufficient to kill the person, just as he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed by a fall--let us say, for instance, from the Washington</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monument. On striking the earth, he would be killed by nega-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive acceleration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the ideas in interplanetary travel is to use a rocket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">propelled vehicle--that is, a vehicle from whose stern gases will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be propelled at high velocity by some explosive mixture. This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way in which a rocket rises upon its impressive flight into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now some of our readers do not understand how a rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">could work in a vacuum, where there is no air for the expelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases to press against. Here again there is a bit of science to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be learned. The rocket acts by pure reaction--the presence or</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence of air has nothing to do with its propulsion. Action</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reaction are equal and opposite.

We'll be off at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made the final adjustments to the apparatus, di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">recting the reflectors of the Rollin mechanism to include</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tiny disc he had attached to the super-microscope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grayson was somewhat apprehensive as he watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attaching and setting of the time switch, but he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of reconsidering or of objecting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Gray," came in measured tones, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist straightened from the completion of his task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drew the younger man into the proper position be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the apparatus and threw an arm affectionately over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder as he reached forth with his free hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">close the main switch and press the button. This time</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed to Grayson that the very fibres of his being</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wrenched asunder. There was a terrific flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding light, an inconceivably violent explosion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a momentary impression of being hurled through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vastness of space. He opened his eyes to the glare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sunlight and instinctively ducked his head at sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a heavy object rushing to meet him. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickening thud and his senses left him completely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Fatal Error</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN Grayson R36B recovered consciousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was slowly and with tortuous, futile attempts</seg><seg type="columnLine">at raising himself to a seated position. He lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">prone in some feathery, aromatic substance that was soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">as down, but of so great a depth as to almost bury his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. His head ached abominably and his lids refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to open at first. Then suddenly he remembered, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat up quickly. He drew his hand across his forehead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought it away covered with blood. Something had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone amiss with their experiment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A feeble moan at his side caused him to search through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fuzzy substance that carpeted this strange realm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came across the figure of his friend, Minott Y8CA.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been injured likewise, but they soon discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nothing more serious than broken scalps and minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruises had been sustained by either. Then they arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had their first sight of the new surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a brown and green landscape that met their</seg><seg type="columnLine">view--not greatly unlike the countryside of their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">world as it had existed many centuries previously when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was thinly populated. The sward beneath their feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of great depth and it was fine-stranded and soft like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman's hair. But it was green--a warm yellow green</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was pleasing to the eyes of these city-bred mortals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the edge of the clearing in which they stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fringe of tall plant life closely akin to the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their own world. These had smooth trunks of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reddish brown hue and rose for a considerable distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">before branching into foliage. The foliage itself was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same warm green as the grass and massed about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tops of the trunks in round, symmetric clusters. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">air was balmy and warm--a gentle breeze stirred the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft carpet of the clearing into rippling waves that lapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the shadows of the forest like the swells of a calm sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">682</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a beautiful place!" exclaimed Grayson, "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">how is it that we were thrown here so heavily and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we did not arrive at the point on which the ray was</seg><seg type="columnLine">focussed? There was a lake at that point, with a sandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach and with habitations visible in the near distance."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minott rubbed his bruises ruefully. "I see it all now,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he exclaimed. "When we combined the Rollin apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the super-microscope, the ray was deflected an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finitesimal amount by the introduction of our hyper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical entities. We are probably quite some distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the point of original focus and at quite a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevation on the miniature world. That is why our land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was not so gentle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson had glanced at the sky and he gasped in utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">amaze: "Why, there are three suns in the heavens!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AND such was the case. One shone hotly red and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jlY was exactly overhead. The other two, of smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">size, shone paler and with a colder light. These two</seg><seg type="columnLine">were close together but fully fifteen degrees from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first and the net result in lighting their surroundings was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brilliance seemingly even greater than that of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own sun and of similar quality as regards color of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. The multiple shadows lent a strange triple com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plement to their movements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I expected that," replied Minott, "This atom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is now our universe, contains quite a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">protons of which these three are self luminous. If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were an atom of gold, whose atomic number is 79 and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atomic weight 197, there would be 79 protons in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nucleus. In addition there would be 118 protons to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make up its weight as well as 118 electrons to neutralize</seg><seg type="columnLine">these 118 protons. About the nucleus there would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">79 additional electrons to neutralize the 79 protons com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prising the atomic number. Of course this universe is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a much less complex one than an atom of gold, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is far more complex than an atom of hydrogen, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">consists of but one proton with a single electron to</seg><seg type="columnLine">neutralize it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then we must expect many things to be different</seg><seg type="columnLine">than those existing at home?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes indeed, and interestingly so. And do you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grayson, we must make up our minds to remain in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place for we shall never be able to return to earth."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What! We can not return?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. I was far too optimistic in my setting of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time switch. According to my watch we have been here</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly thirty minutes already. We were probably un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious for a third of that. The apparatus has long</seg><seg type="columnLine">since functioned and we are still here. Of course the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the super-microscope having been deflected from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">true course by our advent, we were lost to it on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">return, for it would impinge at the point of original</seg><seg type="columnLine">focus, which point we missed. We are doomed to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson gazed gloomily at his mentor. "Fine fix we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are in," he commented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. And it's all my fault for being too precipitate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not taking time to prepare more carefully."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great scientist was so crestfallen that the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man burst into laughter. He threw an arm about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">older man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After all," he said, "What does it matter. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">but little at home that we may not have here. Since both</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother and father are gone I have no one but you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I still have you. There is your home and position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, but insofar as family ties are concerned you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are similarly situated. And we can make a place for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves right here. Probably we shall be better off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bravely spoken my boy," said Minott, with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">answering hug. "And now suppose we explore a bit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">orientate ourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Undismayed, they set forth toward- the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For two hours they tramped through the unfamiliar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">multi-shadowed depths of the wood, stopping often to</seg><seg type="columnLine">examine some new growth that was discovered. It ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be a trackless jungle, peopled only by furred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feathered creatures of small size and timid nature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then suddenly they came out upon a road, a smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">highway of glistening metal that wound its way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, this is encouraging," said Minott^ "All roads</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead somewhere--in both directions. Which shall we</seg><seg type="columnLine">try ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The forest looks thinner to the right. Why not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right. Let's go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With little thought to the future they trod the silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">road for several miles, as they would judge distance on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. They were nearing the edge of the wood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were suddenly in the open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three suns had sunk so low that the two smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones were close to the horizon. The period of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight was about to set in, but ahead of them in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slanting rays, there gleamed a magnificent city, a city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of towering walls and great spires and domes, all con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed of the silvery metal on which they walked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stood spellbound for a moment before advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">further. Each was so impressed with the grandeur of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight that neither spoke a word. Then there came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringing command. Each was sure that no sound had</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken the stillness, yet that command was heard as sure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and clearly as if shouted in their ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was that?" asked Grayson in astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You heard it too? It was a distinct command to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop, though I am sure there was no speaker."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly as it seemed to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Undecided they remained rooted to the spot for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. Then Grayson took an experimental step. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">came that insistent demand and he withdrew the foot he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thrust forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there came a roar from the skies and a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylindrical vessel swooped directly before them, alighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the metal surface of the road as lightly as a bird.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The voice that was not a voice spoke to them once more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Approach closely," it commanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They obeyed in some little trepidation, drawing near</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the strange conveyance and stopping as a small square</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening appeared in the side nearest them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enter," came the insistent, unspoken command.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stepped through the opening into the cylinder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In a New World</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE darkness sfrang into intense light as the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed behind them. Blinded to the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnosis, they saw nothing but eyes--eyes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared and stared; inspected them as if they were-labOT-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atory specimens of an infinitely Inferior sort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then that blinding light was gone--gone so suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the darkness seemed terrifying. But it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">for long. The unspoken voice came once more. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are different!" it said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MICROCOSMIC</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUCCANEERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">683</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soft hands laid hold on them, flabby fingers pawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ugh!" protested Grayson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they were in a room of comfortable brightness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and warmth. Six pairs of the eyes regarded them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time they were aware of the features in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which those all-seeing, all-knowing optics were set. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not the creatures they had viewed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">super-microscope. Far from human was their appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance. But there was more of intelligence--of sinister</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning and evil intent in those blue-rimmed eyes than</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the most despicable and villainous of mortals. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads were hairless and globular, the parchment-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin drawn tight over the ugly skulls. Ears they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">none--nor mouths--nor chins. Nothing there was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked them as human, save those eyes--and these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">superhuman in their penetrating quality and discern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again there came the voice that sounded riot: "Crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of exceptional knowledge," it said, "whence came</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye? Surely not from the savage tribes of Els, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Pra or its satellites. In our solar system there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other inhabited planets. Then, whence came ye?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson and Minott stared at one another without</seg><seg type="columnLine">making reply. Each had understood the questions pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounded, yet neither comprehended fully, nor had they</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard an uttered sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reply!" came the command. "Full well we know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thy lesser intelligences are incapable of communicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such as we, on the terms of equality. Yet, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impulses that come to us, we are aware how ye com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municate one with the other. Ye are possessed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">antiquated organs, ears, lips, bronchial tubes, like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsians. Speak then, that we may read thy thoughts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The older man was struck dumb, but Grayson's youth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful vigor asserted itself in rising anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are from Earth," he said, "on a friendly mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. And we are astonished at the unfriendly reception</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have been accorded."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Earth?" came the voice that was unhearable, "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">speakest thou that which is untrue ? Thy words, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">we hear them not, convey to our superior minds mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings that are false."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MINOTT nudged his impetuous partner into sullen</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Earth, as we call it," he repeated in a conciliatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, "is a planet of another and far away system. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend speaks the truth. We are from Earth, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no enmity against the peoples of your system."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thou liest as well! There is but one other system--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the system of Oc, and that is so far distant as to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreachable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson and Minott felt themselves seized by forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of great power and of unknown source and nature. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled to no avail. There was a quick jerk that threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to the hard floor, and they knew the ship was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion. The light and the penetrating eyes were gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they felt about in the darkness until they found each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, this is a fine welcome!" exclaimed Grayson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and the worst of it is that these beings are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even inhabitants of the world we came to visit. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are doing here I do not know, but they are not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people we saw through the super-microscope and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems they are unfriendly to them as they are to us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What the object of the enmity is, is another thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a sudden swift descent of the vessel, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash, and it came to rest. Windows opened on two</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of the room they occupied and through the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass, or whatever transparent medium it was, they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ship had descended in the city of gleaming metal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They became aware of great activity within and of much</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamor without. A cloud of dense vapor obscured their</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision for a time, during which period the activity with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in increased and they could hear heavy footsteps and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving about of bulky objects. The mist cleared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw a mass of red-gowned humans--humans like</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, with perfectly formed featured. But this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of beings lay in pitiful heaps in the center of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great square where there was no other living thing save</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of the earless, mouthless, large-eyed creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">who poked about among the bodies. They were remov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the valuables from the persons of those unfortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims of the deadly gas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blinding light from within assailed them sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and, blinking dazedly in its glare, they saw five of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-gowned humans thrust into their own cell and thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor. The artificial light vanished as suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it had come--then the daylight as well, for slides of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort were drawn across the transparent windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wonder if we can make ourselves understood to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">other prisoners," said Grayson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a reply, another wordless communication,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mental impression transmitted from the mind of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We understand," it conveyed. "You have but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak for a few minutes and we shall be able to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse with you in your own tongue. Proceed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Minott spoke slowly and distinctly. "Grayson," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "this is a remarkable demonstration of telepathy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those of the great eyes possess the same power, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">something tells me these Elsians, as I presume our fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners are called, have the keener intelligence though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are apparently at the mercy of the great-eyes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship is moving once more and I suppose we are being</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyed as captives of war along with these five who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have just been incarcerated with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke for perhaps five minutes along the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines. Then he was interrupted by a gentle voice, a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of singing quality that pronounced his own uncouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">English in accents that made of it a language of smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have spoken truly," came the voice from out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stygian darkness," and sufficiently to enable us to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse with you. We have learned the mental communica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the Prags--the great-eyes as you humorously</seg><seg type="columnLine">termed them. But such communication is forbidden in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all Els. We prefer the spoken word as we do not wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">to evolve as have the Prags--the pirates who prey on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire universe and who have become hideous in</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance. From where do you come--one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satellites of Pra?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," Minott responded. "We come from another</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system--from a planet called Earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From the system of Oc?" asked the gentle voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, from still further."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Further than Oc ?" The voice was frankly astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, but not incredulous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, much further than Oc. As we measure distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our land, it is but a fraction of an inch to our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, but in your terms, which we know not, it is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unthinkable distance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was puzzlement in the reply and Grayson nud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">684	AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ged his friend into silence. At that moment the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare of the lights dazzled them once more, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Prags entered the narrow chamber. Then there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a gradual softening of the brilliancy until the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors were able to make out clearly the ugly form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Prag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The short body, surmounted by the immense bulbous</seg><seg type="columnLine">head that seemed to be all eyes, was clothed in a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggy garment of leather through which the emaciated</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and legs projected. At the waist, the garment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn together by a broad sash, from which depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wickedly curved knife and a glittering mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">that appeared to be a hand weapon of some sort. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lidless eyes with their strange blue rims and bloodshot</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensity peered through and through the prisoners from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are to appear before the Kama," they were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded by the thoughts of this creature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Minott and Grayson, without volition and propelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a power from without their consciousness, rose meek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and followed the Prag from the room, leaving behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the softly muttering Elsians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Silent Commands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Kama proved to be the commander of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly moving ship and he faced them in a for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward compartment whose transparent sides re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed to them the glories of the sub-universe through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they were traveling. From the mind of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer there came the command to observe the heavens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he watched them narrowly as they gazed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far below them was a swiftly receding orb that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew was the planet Els from which they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">abducted. The super-microscope had shown them a</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar view of the sphere. But there all familiarity</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased, for they had not shifted the focus of their in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strument after discovering the one inhabited electron.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To the left there shone the three suns, the red one dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing a magnificent corona of flaming streamers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazzled them with its glory. The two smaller suns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of the cold light, had no coronas but shone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wavering radiance of enormous mercury vapor lights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The firmament was of ebon blackness and was dotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no less than fifteen major bodies and countless more</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant stars and nebulae. Ahead of them there loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rapidly nearing body that shone with a yellow light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and about which revolved two smaller bodies, one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a greenish hue and the other the same tint as the parent</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. The speed of the pirate vessel must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific, for the shifting of size and position of the visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble bodies was inconceivably rapid. They would arrive</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their destination very soon indeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is as I thought," the mental message of the Kama</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted their thoughts. "My Prags were mistaken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thou hast told them truth. Thy thoughts are entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfamiliar with this system as well as with Oc, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island universe out beyond the twenty-seven planets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For this thou shalt be saved and shall commune with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists of Pra. Long have they theorized on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible existence of universes within universes, of mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter divided and sub-divided to the point where little</seg><seg type="columnLine">exists save empty space. Thou comest from a vaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe wherein our system is but an infinitely small</seg><seg type="columnLine">particle. Is it not so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Minott stared agape. "It is true, Kama," he said,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He made the final adjustments to the appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus, directing the reflectors of the Rollin</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism to include a tiny disc he had at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached to the super-microscope. Grayson was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat apprehensive as he zvatched the set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting of the time switch, but he had no thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reconsidering</seg><seg type="columnLine">MICROCOSMIC BUCCANEERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">685</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"but little did we think to find theories similar to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own in this realm, nor to find a combination of savagery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enlightenment such as the inhabitants of Pra seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have. What is the meaning of it all?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is an inheritance from the distant past," came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unspoken reply. "Not all inhabitants of Pra are Prags,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we are termed by the Elsians, but the Prags are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rightful rulers of our universe. It has been thus from</seg><seg type="columnLine">time immemorial. But ruling the universe in peace is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible accomplishment. Therefore we, the chosen</seg><seg type="columnLine">few, dominate by force the remote provinces of Pra it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and the entire universe of which it is part. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">we do by swooping down on the provinces regularly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">levying tribute in the form of man power and of wealth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is divine inheritance, a prerogative none can gainsay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the outlanders we are cursed and feared, are termed</seg><seg type="columnLine">buccaneers, pirates, freebooters. Yet it is our right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Prags must exist not by labor but by their superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentality. The inferior races of our system must pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant homage and provide us with the living and</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxuries that are ours by divine right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You meet with no resistance?" asked Minott.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Occasionally. But it is futile. The outlanders are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sufficiently clever to outwit the omnipotent, omnis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient Prags."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson sputtered his wrath. "Of all the conceited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicious tommy-rot I ever listened to, this is the vilest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Prags are nothing but drones--drones that sting</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, and that live by the labors and sufferings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the less fortunate. Possibly those ugly skulls of yours</seg><seg type="columnLine">contain more gray matter, but the Elsians have the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualities. They have kindness, love, and tolerance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their make-up, whereas the Prag is utterly devoid of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finer feelings. It is a disgusting exhibition of evolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a coldly scientific proposition--without pity, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenderness, without love. Instead of the gods you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">set yourselves up to be, you are monsters that should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be destroyed. Would that some power could blast you</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the universe: destroy your ugly bodies and minds--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not your souls, for you have none."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson breathed hard as he concluded. Minott feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">mightily for the result of this bitter speech. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unspoken reply was without rancor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thou hads't done better to save thy breath," it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">through to their minds. "Thy feelings are known. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental attitude registers with us far more easily than</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless speech which we can not hear. But it is par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doned; it is expected; it is merely the hatred of the slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">for its master. However, you two will prove interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and valuable to our Great Ones, whom you shall soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit. From them you can hide nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no adequate reply, so the two earth men</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained mute, staring moodily at the great shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere that now loomed -so large in the heavens. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kama podded and the Prag who had brought them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his presence came in and led them back to their cell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A voice greeted them from the darkness as the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">clanged to behind them, the soft voice that now spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">their language.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is to be your fate?" it inquired solicitously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We are to meet the Great Ones, whosoever they may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be," replied Grayson. "We are to tell them of the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which we come and to discuss science with them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is a far happier fate than ours," came the gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, "You should be thankful that your lives are not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sacrificed in the mines and workshops of the Prags,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as are ours. We have no hope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that what becomes of the captives from your</seg><seg type="columnLine">land ?" asked Minott. "Surely the few of you who are</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us in this cell would not be sufficient excuse for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiding trip of this immense ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are doomed to hard labor under conditions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such grueling severity that our lives are shortened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than half their normal span," spoke the voice, "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to the number of the captives, we five are but a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportion. There are four great prison cells in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessels. Each contains one hundred Elsians. We five</seg><seg type="columnLine">are merely an overflow and were thrown in this small</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell with you two because there was not room. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">have also brought large quantities of precious metals</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our city."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What rotten scoundrels they are!" exclaimed Gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. "Do such raids occur often?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only often enough to replenish their stores and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">replace the workers who have died off in their misery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there is also the raid, or rather the expected visit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they compel us to give up three hundred of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairest maidens. This occurs once during each revolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of Els."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Once a year!" exclaimed Grayson. "Good grief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">do they take your women for mating purposes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. Merely for their amusement--to grace their</seg><seg type="columnLine">debauches and orgies, and to die, before their time, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shame and of physical decay brought about by the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are forced to lead. No, the Prags do not mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our women. That would pollute the strain they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have so carefully evolved through eons of time."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Horrible!" exploded Grayson. "Can nothing be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forestall them? Have you not retaliated? Can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">not organize man power and materials to destroy these</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hush!" replied the Elsian. "We must not speak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such things. Our every word may even now be going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on record and be used against us. There are plans, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we must not speak of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson and Minott shivered with horror at the tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Elsian. Neither replied. And then they felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">retardation of the speed of the vessel. It came to a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"We are about to land," spoke the invisible Elsian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, in the land of the Prags," said Grayson, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">loathing in his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE scene on the landing stage in the city of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prags will remain forever impressed on the minds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two earth men. A vast, mirror-like surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">it presented and there were gathered thousands of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">misshapen creatures to welcome the return of the raiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel with its load of treasure and prisoners. The sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pink, upturned expanses of flesh that were containers</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely for the huge brains and the staring optics over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came them with nausea. To think that these monstrosi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties were in the ascendancy over the handsome and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindly Elsians!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were sickened at the brutal handling of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than four hundred fellow prisoners and Grayson</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried his rage aloud at sight of a number of aggravated</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases in the prodding and beating of stragglers and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellious captives. The three suns shone on the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">with even greater brilliance than they had in Els--</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently Pra was considerably closer. The atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heavy and foul as opposed to the sweet-scented, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">686</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorating air of Els. There was a haze over everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the humidity was such as to bring beads of perspira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the brows of the earth men. In perfect uniform-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity on all sides of the great landing stage, there rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">towering buildings of ebon blackness--not the glossy</seg><seg type="columnLine">black of jet, but a dead, lifeless charcoal that reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">so little light as to cast a pall of gloom about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the confusion attendant upon the landing and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposal of the Elsian prisoners, Grayson and Minott</seg><seg type="columnLine">had drawn aside unhindered and apparently unnoticed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were now approached by the Kama and, by exer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cise of his will, he compelled them to follow him. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked through staring crowds of the detestable Prags</seg><seg type="columnLine">and entered one of the gloomy buildings at the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the landing stage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No hand was laid on them, yet they were forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceed in the desired direction as inexorably as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been bound and carried. They were taken' into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift which soon bore them to the uppermost portion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the structure. There, on the top level under a vast ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panse of the transparent material used in the windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ship, they were brought to the Great Ones. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge compartment was a veritable conservatory. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloomed with strange and rank vegetation. Tall, ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pentine growths of ghastly gray hue spread sickly fronds</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the uppermost heights under the transparent covering</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead. The earth men wrinkled their nostrils in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsion at the offensive odors of the plant life that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently admired by the Prags. They moved slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a passageway between the growths and soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a sort of dais on which there were three cush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned divans set in triangular formation in the full glare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Pragian sun. On these reposed the Great Ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mere brains were the Great Ones. Their bodies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrunken beyond all belief and the huge, semi-trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent heads lay helpless amongst the cushions, the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense eyes presenting the only evidence of life in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kama bowed low and Grayson and Minott per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">force followed suit, though they raged inwardly. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupefied silence they peered into the eyes of the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones, and, for the first time, Grayson observed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of the blue rims about the unblinking orbs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, the highest type of Prags. They were porous</seg><seg type="columnLine">areas, and the minute pores opened and closed rhythmi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally! They were the breathing organs of the uncouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">things! But the discovery detracted not one whit from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hypnotic effect of the bloodshot eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beings from the great outside universe," came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts of one of the Great Ones, they knew not which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you come at an opportune time. We have but re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently discovered the existence of your universe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would learn more of its extent and peculiarities from</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent dwellers therein. We would likewise know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">your advent into our system was accomplished. Speak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Minott replied, "Our universe is to yours as is yours</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a grain of sand by the seashore. We entered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of an extremely powerful microscope and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth dimension."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thy first statement is understood and conceded. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to the second, there is some doubt. Concentrate on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this instrument of which thou speakest, that we may</seg><seg type="columnLine">read of its construction and operation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson exploded, "Don't do it, Minott. The beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">will try to reverse the process and enter our own system."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Objections are useless," replied Minott to his hot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed ward. Then he continued in an elaborate de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scription of the super-microscope while Grayson fumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fretted at the seemingly indiscreet speech of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is well," came the approving thoughts of the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones, "Thou hast the intelligence to know that the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation should have been purloined from thy very</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain hadst thou not given it willingly. But it is enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the present. We shall commune further at a later</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Meanwhile thy friend is condemned to the mines.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He is of inferior intellect."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Minott protested sorrowingly. Grayson endeavored</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attack the monstrosities that lay so smugly among</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cushions, but the mysterious power once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped him and he was led helpless from the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Great Ones. Minott's eyes followed sadly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE treatment accorded the scientist was greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">different. At a command from the Great Ones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two slaves entered their presence and were ordered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">convey him to certain living qfuarters. To Minott's de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, these slaves were Elsians who had kindly human</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenances, and seemed overjoyed at being permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to serve a creature so like their own kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was conveyed to rooms that, but for the difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">in colors and kinds of materials used, might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his own land. But he walked the floor with his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly on Grayson. The two Elsians stood aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently, as they observed the dejection of their new</seg><seg type="columnLine">master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clearly to him then came the mental, message, "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are worried about a friend?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Minott peered startled at the nearest of the Elsians</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was smiling commiseratingly. "Er--yes," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitatingly. "My friend from another world, who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been condemned to the mines."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speak further," came the encouraging message. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minott poured out his heart to the gravely listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsians. He told of Grayson's childhood, of his later</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, of the experiment that had brought them to Els and</seg><seg type="columnLine">resulted in their capture by the Prags. He concluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a hopeless note, as he told of the scene in the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Great Ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fear not," came in perfect English when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished, "the time is close at hand. Grayson will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescued, as will all of our people when the great day</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes. You have but to be patient and obey all com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mands of the Great Ones. Through our secret system</seg><seg type="columnLine">of communication, we shall learn of the whereabouts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your friend and arrange for the interchange of messages</seg><seg type="columnLine">between you and him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Minott was astounded at the facility with which this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsian had learned his own tongue--more easily than</seg><seg type="columnLine">had. the first in the space ship. But he was elated at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope held forth and was about to make eager reply</seg><seg type="columnLine">when there came an insistent buzz from close by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the Elsians left the room hurriedly and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other--he who had spoken--laid a warning finger to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips and busied himself with the appurtenances of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressing table. Minott knew not what to expect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was complete silence for a moment. Then two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prags entered the room, bearing between them a golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere of the diameter of a large pumpkin. With a curt</seg><seg type="columnLine">nod from one of them, the Elsian servant was dismissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they set the shimmering globe on a table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drawn to the beautiful polished object by an irresisti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble force, the scientist found himself gazing into depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wavering brightness that soon resolved into scenes</seg><seg type="columnLine">MICROCOSMIC</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUCCANEERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">687</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other electron planet, Els. With great rapidity</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scenes shifted, outlining in rapid succession an entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">continent and picturing city after city similar to the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had first seen. Rural districts were also covered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular attention being paid to the vicinities of small</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies of water. Then suddenly he recognized the local-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity they had been observing through the super-micro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope. His start of recollection brought about the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediate cessation of the action of the sphere and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental message came at once from one of the Prags:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is well. The location of the ray is determined."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They marched solemnly from the room without fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther ado, taking the golden sphere with them. The clang</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the door as they left brought a sense of dire forebod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to Minott and he stared helplessly about the lonely</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Among the Elsians</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR several days Grayson labored with pick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shovel in an underground passage that was so nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row and stifling that he was too exhausted each</seg><seg type="columnLine">night to even think of the fate that had befallen him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The material he was wresting from narrow veins in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damp wall of rock was radioactive--no light was needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in these workings--and he knew that his life would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">short indeed if he were forced to continue in this place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been put into the most dangerous of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mines. But the physical presence of the Prags was</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped during the long hours of labor, and this was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief of a sort, though the force of distant wills kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">him doggedly at his task. The Prags never entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diggings where the mineral that supplied them with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">main source of energy was obtained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came a day when the Elsian who worked next</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him spoke to him in his own tongue. A message had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from above--a message from Minott! It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The scientist was well, it seemed, and wished to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form his friend that powerful forces were at work</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would eventually bring about their release from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pra and their return to Els. He was bidden to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," asked Grayson, "how has this message been</seg><seg type="columnLine">relayed to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By word of mouth entirely. It has passed on from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Elsian servant of your friend and has undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">been repeated a score of times on its way to this re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mote working. We have perfected among the captives</seg><seg type="columnLine">a secret system of communication that serves the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose admirably, though it is somewhat slow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The message gives word of help to come," said Gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. "What does this mean ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It means this," replied Oril, for that was the cogno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of his new friend. "The prisoners on this accursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">island have formed plans that will eventually result in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the destruction of the Prags and in the liberation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves. They will result in the halting of the age-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long piracy to which our worlds have been subjected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the salvation of the civilizations that have for so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long a time been under the lash."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "By what means is this to be done?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I cannot divulge the secret until you have been ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted to our council. But this will be soon, and I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you that the vulnerability of the Prags has been dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered, and that Els and the two satellites of Pra, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as the outlying provinces of Pra itself, are banded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">together to end the dominance of these creatures for</seg><seg type="columnLine">once and all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You spoke of an island," said Grayson. "Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that the Prags inhabit no part of this planet ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept a single island ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is correct. The island is known to us as Capis</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it comprises less than one tenth of the total habit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able surface of Pra. The outlying provinces are popu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated sparsely and by a miserable race of downtrodden</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures, who were subject to the banditry of the Prags</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ages, before they discovered the means of traversing</seg><seg type="columnLine">space and transferred their major activities to the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabited bodies of our system. The provinces have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled dry and the peoples are hopelessly retarded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their civilization. They resemble us in appearance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though their skin is of much darker hue, and in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sections they have almost reverted to savagery. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of that is to be changed also."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This council of which you spoke. When and where</seg><seg type="columnLine">does it meet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At present there is a meeting every night in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deepest levels of the mines. But each night those</seg><seg type="columnLine">present are a different group and word of the proceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings is carried over to the next night by a single member</seg><seg type="columnLine">who thus attends two meetings in succession. This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary in order that the Prags shall not suspect us</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such activities as they surely would, if any consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able number of us were absent from our quarters on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single evening. Of course we are aided in this by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that they feel absolutely secure in their diabolic</seg><seg type="columnLine">tyranny over us, and so do not anticipate a rebellion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of serious nature. They underestimate the courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mentality of the long-suffering outlanders, and are</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus thrown more or less off guard by their own colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conversation was interrupted by the shrill siren</seg><seg type="columnLine">that called the workers to the evening meal--the siren</seg><seg type="columnLine">that told them of the completion of the long day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor. The two were soon in the great bucket that car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried them to the surface, along with some fifty more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fellow prisoners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GRAYSON pondered over the things he had heard all</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the nightly inspection and during the meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was presided over so strictly by a number of lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">class Prags. These were not of the type that possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intense power of will over the prisoners, but en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced their dicta by free use of the lash and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">aggravated cases of insubordination, by the use of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray pistols they carried at their belts. Grayson had once</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen one of these weapons used and he carried horrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembrance of its action in his mind. The unfortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim of the crackling blue flare that greeted a minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">insolence, had crumpled before his eyes into a heap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">putrefaction that rapidly shrank to complete and terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolution. He shuddered anew at the thought and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to finish his food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the words of Oril had cheered him, though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doubtful of the ability of the Elsians and other out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">landers to conquer these monstrosities, who were pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed of such marvelous mental powers and had evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently been lords of the tiny universe for ages of time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later in the evening, when the three suns had set and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoners were herded to their underground quarters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he received word from Oril that he was expected to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend the meeting of the council to be held late that night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was elated over the news and could scarcely remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">688</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly in his bunk until the time set for his adventuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth from the huge bunk room into the dark passages</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he was to be led to the meeting place of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirators. Oril had given him explicit directions and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that he would have no trouble in joining the guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was to await him. His neighbors were asleep on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the low cots that were provided by the Prags in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk rooms, and the lone guard was nodding in the dim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit comer of the long hall. The faint whimpers of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick prisoner, a few cots from his own, had ceased and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grayson hoped that the poor devil had found relief from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sufferings in the mercy of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there was the padding of soft footsteps and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dim light he saw that two of the upper class Prags</seg><seg type="columnLine">had entered and were conferring with the guard, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had started guiltily from his nap at their approach. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">newcomers were led through the long aisle and Grayson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart missed a beat as they neared him where he lay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He feigned sleep and when the brilliant beams of a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch were turned on him he opened blinking eyes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their glare. He was discovered as a conspirator, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never know the plans of the brave band which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was setting out to free the worlds they knew from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron hand of the oppressor!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was the single command to follow, so he arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his hard couch and obeyed the order in silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing else he could do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was conducted to the surface and taken to a small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly lighted landing stage where one of the tiny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird-like air vehicles of Capis awaited. In a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had winged their way aloft and were headed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights of the city of the Great Ones. What was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fate Grayson did not know, nor did he much care--</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. He had scented adventure and it was to be denied</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He had hoped to engage in the battle for freedom</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Oril had hinted was coming. But he was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently doomed to disappointment and worse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drone of the motor and the swish of the flapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings of the vessel that carried them swiftly toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city were the only sounds to disturb his train of gloomy</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. The Prags, mute always, did not explain by</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental message the reason for his move from the mines</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the city. But he suspected that his and Oril's</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation was known to the Great Ones and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to answer to them for his part in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beneath them circled the lights of the great city as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship swung around to effect a landing. The motor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and they swooped with a rush toward a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">square that was outlined by a fringe of orange light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It rushed upward to meet them and it seemed they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely crash. Then there was a single powerful beat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broad wings and the little craft alighted without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jar. Below them was the transparent roof of the head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters of the Great Ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Grayson Comes Back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GRAYSON, with rebellion and fury in his heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">neared the throne where lay the three arch-pirates</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the atom universe. He longed to lay hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one of the vile creatures and tear him limb from</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb. And when he saw the haggard face of his friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minott, who sat at a small table adjacent to the dais, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched his fists, as if about to carry out his rash desire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quick as a flash there came the paralyzing of the muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was produced so easily by some mental process of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ghastly creatures, and a single unspoken warning that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to come from within his own consciousness:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Cease thy futile ragings," came the adjuration, "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans of the Great Ones have altered to thy good. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer shalt thou labor in the mines. This night thou</seg><seg type="columnLine">shalt depart for Els in one of our space ships and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">company of thy friend. Minott has been of much assis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance to us and, in gratitude, we have granted his wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">that thou mayst be permitted to join him in this expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of our scientists. That is all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson's tense muscles relaxed. Then they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know of his talk with Oril! But he cast the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his mind at once, fearing to betray himself to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncanny faculties. Minott smiled wanly and greeted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with open arms. Evidently he too had suffered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to suffer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were dismissed immediately by the Great Ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">and repaired to Minott's quarters to prepare for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it all about?" asked Grayson, when their</seg><seg type="columnLine">affectionate greetings were over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a plan to attack our own world," came the hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less reply, "and we are to assist them and act as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">guides when they reach there--if they do. I was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled to give them all of my data regarding the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miscroscope and the four-dimensional means used by</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in reaching this system. They learned from me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">location of the ray of my super-microscope where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">still impinges on the planet Els at the edge of the lake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their scientists have calculated that the process can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">reversed, and they have constructed a duplicate of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rollin apparatus in accordance with my description</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mechanism. They reason that they can utilize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray that still connects the point we were watching in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Els with my laboratory at home, and they plan to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of their space ships, manned and armed, to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">world along this beam."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is such a thing possible?" gasped Grayson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I fear that it is, my boy. You see the time-space</seg><seg type="columnLine">relationship can as well be altered in one direction as</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the other. By the same means that we adapted our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves to conditions on this plane, they should be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">adapt themselves to conditions on our own. I can pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">no flaw in their calculations, and I am mortally afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this unspeakable banditry of theirs is to be extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our own country. The worst of it is, we are helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But--but," objected the younger man, "if one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these space ships of the Prags is rotated into the hyper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical plane and then emerges in your laboratory, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be of enormous size. It can not occupy the avail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able space, if it is of the same proportions there as it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will burst the walls of the laboratory like a chicken</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking forth from an egg and will lie exposed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky amid the debris of a great section that will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been torn from the upper surface of our own New York.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You forget that my laboratory is in the extreme upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">level and that the walls and floors of our city structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">will crumple like glass against the sides of a vessel of</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than 1000 feet in length and with walls as hard as</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel and of more than five feet thickness--suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust in their midst as it will be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson groaned. He was heart-sick over the change</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had come to the beloved features of his foster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">father. Minott had aged ten years, it seemed, during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the few days they had been in this awful realm. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought too of the terrible engine of destruction to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">MICROCOSMIC BUCCANEERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">689</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">let loose on an unsuspecting world--and of others to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow, for the Prags would not stop at one if the initial</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture proved to be a success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is there no way of stopping the brutes?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None that I can think of. Of course we must do</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything we can to upset their plans, but I am afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are helpless."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came the sound of the buzzer and Minott paled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a still more ghastly color. "It is the signal," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They are ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two earth men hurried to the great landing stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the heart of the city and there entered one of the shiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylindrical vessels, of which Minott had learned there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were seven in existence. This time they were not carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">as prisoners but as more or less unwelcome, but tolerated</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests. They were quartered on the same deck with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine scientists sent by the Great Ones to complete the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans for sending an expedition into the "Outside Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse." Before they had even settled themselves in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cabins, the ship had taken off and they were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way to Els. When the Great Ones determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a thing was to be done, little delay was brooked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All through the remainder of the night the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked, when they should have been resting in their beds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had been separated for more than a week and each</seg><seg type="columnLine">had much to tell the other. It was a matter of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculation between them as to what the plans of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"outlanders" were for the overthrowing of the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Great Ones and the destruction of the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">breed of Prags. The slight information given to Gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son by Oril was supplemented by but little more that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minott had learned from his Elsian servants. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was certain that the outlanders were confident of ulti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mately ridding themselves of their ancient enemy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the day for the culmination of their plans was close</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hand. Whether it was to come quickly enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forestall the Prags in this new venture they did not know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And they discussed matters until the Prag vessel slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the dawn-brightened atmosphere of Els.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vessel was soon close to the surface and the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">men joined the Prags, who had assembled in the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment, where the transparent floors gave them</seg><seg type="columnLine">a full view of the scene beneath and where the rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the first sun could be seen through the transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">side walls. The first dawn of Els reminded them of</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonrise on their own world, for the quality of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">was similar, though of greater intensity. It would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">several minutes before the second of the cold suns rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one twelfth of an Elsian day before the red glare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the third sun greeted them. The ship was skimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface rapidly at an altitude comparable to about</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thousand feet above the surface as measured on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, and the peaceful countryside below showed signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the early activities of the day. Here and there a</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmer with his flock of quadrupeds strangely resembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheep was thrown into a panic at the passage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirate vessel, and at several points early travelers in high</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed vehicles that traversed the shining roads deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cars and fled into adjacent forests in fright at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same vision. But the ship from Pra kept steadily on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and within a short time they saw far ahead a scene that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed vaguely familiar. Closer they drew and, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel slowed down, they saw they were nearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake they had seen through the super-microscope in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minott's laboratory. They were overhead of it in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trice and the great ship circled about to make a landing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several Elsians who walked by the shore of the lake</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ran in affright for their homes--mere huts and cabins</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were set back a little distance from the shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The point of focus of the super-microscope!" ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed Minott.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at Grayson with blanched features and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hearts sank at the realization that they were about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to land in this spot, where they would be compelled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assist their captors in preparing for a piratical raid on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Preparations in Els</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH the coming of the pirate vessel to the shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their lake, the neighboring villagers expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worst. Knowing there was no escaping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases and the paralyzing forces of the enemy, they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not attempt to flee the vicinity, but they retreated within</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors to postpone their certain doom for as long a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible. And when, on the second day, they observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were not to be molested, but that the Prags</seg><seg type="columnLine">were erecting strange mechanisms in the open outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space-ship and covering these over with rude shelters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few of the bolder ones ventured forth from the homes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn what it was all about. They were still un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">molested and they gazed in open-mouthed wonder at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight of a considerable number of Prags actually at</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, laboring with their hands in feverish haste. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still more astonished to see that the earth-men, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom they had heard through the medium of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">local news broadcast, were aiding the hated Prags. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that there was some difficulty with the apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">being erected and they saw that the higher class Prags</seg><seg type="columnLine">were greatly perturbed over some unforeseen trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the days passed and nothing happened beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional relocating of the odd contrivances and further</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjustments of their parts, some of the natives went so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as to gather around the scene of activity and watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proceedings with bold curiosity. Upon, seeing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Elsians were given little attention by the busy Prags,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grayson made it a point to wander away from the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">several times and mingle with the watchers. In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner he struck up an acquaintance with one Atar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who seemed to be an Elsian of some standing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">community and who mastered Grayson's speech in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very short time as had been done by others of his coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trymen. He made friends quickly with the villagers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and advised them as to the meaning of the strange pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceedings in the open space at the shore of the lake. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn he was told much of the plans of the outlanders</seg><seg type="columnLine">for conquering the Prags and he learned that the day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckoning was not far off, though it was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty days in the future, and he felt certain that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment with the Rollin apparatus and the focus ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the super-microscope would be successful long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told Minott of these things in the privacy of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin aboard the space ship and the scientist was deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned over this fraternizing with the Elsians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Grayson," he warned, "these Prags are possessed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncanny faculties and, though they are now so deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">engrossed in the work at hand as to pay little attention,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the lower class is apt to surprise you in treach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erous conversation one of these fine days and you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay the penalty at the receiving end of one of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible dissolution rays."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be careful. And besides, I like these people and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to be friends with them. Our case looks hopeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway and if I can do nothing to prevent the atrocities</seg><seg type="columnLine">690</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of these monsters, I can at least show that my heart is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the right place, until such time as the fate overtakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that is bound to come sooner or later in any event.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How is the work progressing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, as you know, the reflectors were reset today</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the apparatus readjusted. The energy was tried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a test specimen, one of the small rodents they brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them, and the result left them more worried than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. The rodent passed into the hyperphysical plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right, but was returned fearfully distorted and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying condition. This has given them pause."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You old fox," chuckled Grayson, "I'll bet you threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a monkey wrench in the gears somewhere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," was the solemn reply, "I did nothing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort. I must admit, however, that I see a fault in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus about which I have not advised them. Fortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is that the Great Ones are not here, for they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have read it out of my mind. These Prags have not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind-reading faculty to so great a degree as have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Ones, and I find that I can hide my thoughts from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them fairly well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you think the ultimate success of the project</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be delayed for a considerable time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Possibly. But not for long, my boy. These arch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiends are devilishly clever and they will stumble on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difficulty in short order--at least within the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten days, I should say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it absolutely certain that the ray of the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">microscope is still in operation ?",</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Absolutely. By means of the balvanometers, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have located the exact center of impingement and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">mapped the entire circle of its influence, which extends</seg><seg type="columnLine">well past the village and outlines the view just as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnessed it back home. There is no question of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">workability of their plan, once the Rollin apparatus is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in perfect working condition."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson looked moodily from the open window toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights of the village. The sweet breath of the Elsian</seg><seg type="columnLine">countryside was wafted to his grateful nostrils. How he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished that conditions were different--that he might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">free to roam about as he pleased and explore this in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viting planet they had so rashly visited. But the arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Prag was long, and he knew he could not get</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away if he attempted to escape. Besides there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minott--and the threatened expedition against his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the stillness of the Elsian night there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint wavering tremolo--a feminine cry that rose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid crescendo to a wailing scream. The two earth men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were electrified to tense expectancy but the cry was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By George!" exclaimed Grayson. "That cry came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the village and I'm going to find out what it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady now," admonished Minott. "How do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect to pass the guard at the door of the vessel?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grayson was busy pulling the bedclothes from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunks. "Not going to," he grunted, "I'm going out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, all protests of his friend notwithstanding, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made good his statement. Quickly he knotted the sheets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and coverlets into a rope of considerable length and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">he let out through the open window. Bidding Minott</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hasty farewell after tying the makeshift line to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring used for fastening the window, he let himself down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground and made off through the darkness in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reaching the fenced-in grass plot that was the gather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing place of the small town, he found that considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement centered about the loud speakers of the local</seg><seg type="columnLine">news broadcast receiver. A crowd had collected and</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry shouts and protests came from every side. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little group in the center of the square was huddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a prone figure and Grayson pushed his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through until he saw that an extremely beautiful Elsian</seg><seg type="columnLine">maiden lay stretched on the grass in a faint. Over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent Atar, his friend of the past few days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, Atar?" he asked, when close enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the ear of the obviously agitated Elsian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lola--my daughter Lola," groaned the stricken man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She has been chosen for the next lot of three hundred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In six days she will be torn from her home and taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Capis--a slave to the beasts we hate. And in so short</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time we should have prevented it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson observed the smooth pallor of the girl's skin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her perfect features, the glossy sheen of her hair as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread over her shoulders where she lay. Then her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast rose and, with a deep sigh, she turned her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his direction and slowly opened the most wondrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of violet eyes he had ever seen. Atar clasped her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his arms convulsively and sobbed like a child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By God!" swore Grayson, "they'll not get her!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lola</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I ATE that night Grayson returned to his cabin in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same way he had left. Minott was sleeping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep of exhaustion, so he had no one in whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could confide. But he did not awaken his friend, preferring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fret and toss in his own bunk rather than disturb him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally he drifted into troubled slumber, into dreams</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the beautiful Lola who had looked at him so plead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, dreams of the Prags and of frightful battles with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, in which he fought to protect the lovely daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Atar. His tortured mind was not resting for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, even in sleep. He dreamed of Minott--dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Minott--and the scientist seemed to be delivering</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his early talks to the younger man. He told of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the composition of matter, of molecules and atoms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrons--of the universe of the atom where the elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trons were the bodies that revolved about the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun or nucleus. It came to him that an atom was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, that if magnified as much as ten billion times--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second stage power of the super-microscope--the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrons would appear to be as much as three feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nucleus, yet the nucleus itself was still no larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a pin point. It was all a muddle, yet in his slumbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that all these things were actually transpiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a minute world that was nothing more than an elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tron in an atom of unidentified matter contained in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grain of sand that lay on the slide of Minott's super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">microscope in the New York laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the morning he awoke unrefreshed and the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he did was to advise Minott of the happenings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Worse and more of it," groaned the scientist. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought the annual tribute of three hundred girls was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not due for forty-five days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So did I. That is what I was told, and the day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckoning was purposely set for a few days before that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to prevent this very occurrence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, my boy, we are between the devil and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep blue sea. Here we are helping the brutes in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to raid our own world and at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">MICROCOSMIC BUCCANEERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">691</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you have gone to work and fallen in love with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsian damsel who is about to be abducted. Meanwhile</seg><seg type="columnLine">the decent folks of this little universe are about to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a break for freedom and the break will be too late to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">your new girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Minott's eyes twinkled despite the hopelessness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation and Grayson could not repress the flush that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mantled his features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But what can we do ?" he countered. "I'll admit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Lola has made a great impression on me and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">George they are not going to get her if I can prevent it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what can we do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Minott spoke solemnly now. "Don't do anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">rash, Grayson," he advised. "Keep your eyes open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">use your best judgment, but do not forget that we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a powerful enemy to deal with. Our first duty is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own world, but of course we can do very little to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent the Prags from carrying out their present plans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably the best thing is to submit to things as they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trust that not too great damage will be accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this initial venture into our universe. Then, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they return from the trip, it will be about time for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">action planned by the outlanders and further trouble will</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus be averted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But dammit, Minott, that doesn't save Lola. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">she must be saved. I--I want her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You poor boy! Is it as bad as that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes." Grayson kicked savagely at the towel he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just dropped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, run along to the village then and see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can learn. I'll hold the fort here and--who knows ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grayson needed not to be told a second time and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">older man watched him with misty eyes as he rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the compartment in his haste to be gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was very early and the Prags were late risers, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grayson did not anticipate any interference with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the vessel. But when he came to the entrance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found some little difficulty in convincing the guard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was merely going for a morning stroll. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard was one of the lower class of Prags and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand the earthman's thoughts unless he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually speaking. It seemed that the spoken words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the Prags heard them not, were a medium that</seg><seg type="columnLine">facilitated the telepathic process. And when Grayson</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the latch of the door, this low-class Prag laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent hands on him. Quick as a flash the earth man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had him by the throat and was battering the huge head</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the metal partition. The Prag fell unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Grayson, stopping only to take the ray pistol from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his belt, rushed from the ship and made for the village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE had crossed the Rubicon! He knew his life was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now forfeit but he was armed. And he was on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to Lola, come what might.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Atar met him at the cottage door with a smile on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and Lola's greeting was such as to cause him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">flush with pleasure. The girl was radiant and the father</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly less so, for during the night there had come a</seg><seg type="columnLine">message from Arun, capital city of the province, calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the three hundred maidens to the city with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents. It was stated in the message that action was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be taken to prevent the turning over of the annual</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribute to the Prags, and this statement accounted for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the happiness of father and daughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson told of his skirmish with the guard of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel and offered to accompany them on their visit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arun, since it was now necessary for him to leave the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vicinity in any event, and he felt that he might be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some service in their company. Atar welcomed the offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Lola's downcast eyes told of her surprise and pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure. The earth man's heart sang, though full well he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the shadow of death hung over them all. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fondly patted the ray pistol where it lay hidden in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket. He did not worry about Minott, for he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Great Ones considered him too valuable to allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to be harmed as long as there was still information</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be obtained from him regarding the outer universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The government ronsal, or road vehicle, that was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">call for Lola and her father, arrived in a very short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. It was a car of considerable length, mounted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">two wheels of a diameter the height of a man, and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely enclosed in transparent material of crystal clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. From within there came a musical note that told</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the high speed of the gyroscope used for balancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine. There were four other girls already on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board with their families and with the entrance of Lola</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the two men all available space was filled. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ronsal started smoothly and was soon rolling over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the metal road with terrific velocity. Gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son learned that it was but a short run to Arun--less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than one ul, the unit of time that was the twentieth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Elsian day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ribbon of gleaming metal, over which they sped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound through a beautiful country, but Grayson saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">very little of it. He was too busy gazing into those</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet eyes and watching the lips of the beautiful girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side, as they formed the unfamiliar, yet rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned syllables of his own tongue. So it was that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the time they had reached the walls of Arun, he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lola were conversing fluently in English, and he had even</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up a number of words and phrases of the Elsian</seg><seg type="columnLine">language. Atar observed these things with approval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once within the portals of the huge gate that raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their approach, they were escorted immediately to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great council chamber where sat the provincial governor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his deputies. A great assemblage of Elsians was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and Grayson thought that almost all of the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred chosen beauties had preceded them. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to see a single maiden that could compare with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lola, though all of them were undoubtedly charming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a short wait for a few more arrivals, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">which a secretary called the roll. The Governor then</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose and spoke rapidly and forcefully in the Elsian</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue, becoming much excited and red-faced during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speech. At its conclusion there came a great cheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the assemblage and Grayson noticed that tears of</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy coursed down the cheeks of Atar. Lola translated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him quickly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He says that the government has decided not to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us be sacrificed" she said happily. "The day of reckon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with the Prags is set ahead and is to be tomorrow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of as planned. We girls are to be kept in Arun</seg><seg type="columnLine">under government protection and our families as well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the fighting is going on. The prisoners on Pra</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been notified, as well as the inhabitants of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">satellites and those of the outlying provinces of Pra</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hooray!" exclaimed Grayson. And he grasped Atar</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the hand and hurried him to the rostrum, where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">requested him to translate his offer of enlistment in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces of Arun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was some staccato questioning by the Governor</seg><seg type="columnLine">--equally rapid-fire replies from Atar--and Grayson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was accepted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">692</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Grayson Joins Forces</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEXT morning Grayson was outfitted with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform and equipment of an Elsian soldier. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was permitted to retain the ray pistol he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken from the Prag guard and considerable envy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">displayed by his fellows over its possession. He requested</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he be allowed to bid farewell to Lola and Atar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this too was granted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lola gurgled with delight when she saw him and a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill came to him as she hugged his arm in her glee and</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration. Atar bid him an affectionate adieu and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanked him profusely for his help and for the courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">his presence and support had lent. When Lola accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied him to the door of their quarters his cup was</seg><seg type="columnLine">full, and he bent suddenly down and kissed her upturned</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. Then, in a sudden panic over his temerity, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced for the square of Arun where the soldiery was</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembling. Had he looked back, he would have known</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his caress was not unwelcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a great hullaballoo in the square, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that all of the population of the city had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to witness the departure of the expedition. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time Grayson knew what it was all about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the center of the square there were two circular pits</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into the mouths of these the soldiers were descend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Each of the pits contained a space flyer that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been built secretly during the preceding two years and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were two others of the same type to set forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from another city of Els. The Prags were to be taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">by complete surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson joined his unit and was soon within one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great spheres, that were so different from the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectile-shaped vessels of the Prags. The number carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">by each vessel was in excess of five hundred; including</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew and soldiery. He was extremely interested in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment of the vessel and in the activities of his new</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrades. So, when the confusion had subsided and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hatches were battened down, he struck up a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation with his commanding officer, using his few</seg><seg type="columnLine">words of Elsian as an entering wedge. He was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased to find that the captain, Erne by name, was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pick up his own language almost at once as had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">done by the others with whom he had come in contact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship was under way in a surprisingly short time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting forth from the mouth of the pit like a ball from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bore of an old-fashioned cannon. They were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way to Pra and Grayson was bursting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity as he questioned the indulgent Erne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the plan of campaign?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are four ships leaving Els, two more from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aun and three from Rad. These are the satellites of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pra. It is known that all of the fliers of the Prags are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their own cradles excepting two, one of which is at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore of Lake Ilo in Els and the other in the province</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Trasa in Pra. We will leave our own people at home</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deal with the one at Lake Ilo and the outlanders will</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal with the one at Trasa. But the nine vessels will</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack Capis directly and will be assisted by the prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">there who are apprised of our coming and of the change</seg><seg type="columnLine">in plans."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But, what weapons are to be used against the Prags ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't you know?" asked Erne in surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. I had heard vague hints of a recent discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was expected to prove effective, but I have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of its nature."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Erne withdrew from Grayson's belt the cylindrical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">object which had been given to him with the rest of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have not been instructed in the use of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trinor?" he inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have not had the opportunity as yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cylinder was of blued metal and by earthly stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ards Grayson would have judged it to be eighteen inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">in length and three in diameter. There was a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch at one end and Erne pressed this to demonstrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the operation of the weapon. There was a shrill sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">from within that rose rapidly in pitch until it was a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream. Then it vanished entirely but the weapon still</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrated smoothly to the impulses of some mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The trinor," said Erne, "sets up sound waves or</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations in the atmosphere. As you noticed, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original sound was audible but gradually rose in pitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it passed beyond the normal response of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">auditory organs. But the trinor is still sending forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful waves that disturb the air at the rate of twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five thousand cycles per second. These are the waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will destroy the enemy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how ?" asked Grayson. "The Prags can hear no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds of any frequency."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True. But you must remember that the Prag was</seg><seg type="columnLine">originally equipped with ears and auditory nerves the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same as you and I. In the course of his evolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ages he learned thought transference and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ears were no longer necessary. After many genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of disuse they atrophied and all outer portions</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared entirely. But there still remained certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the inner parts and these are still in existence. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago we had three of the enemies in Arun whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had taken prisoner during one of their raids and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists experimented with them until they learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their susceptibility to the high frequency air waves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You see it happens that certain tiny bones that are all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that remain of the Prag's inner ear lie very close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great vein that supplies the brain with blood. By subject-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the Prag's body to air waves of the high frequency</seg><seg type="columnLine">I mentioned, these bones are set in vibration and, due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their contact with the artery against which they lie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clot is formed which is carried to the brain and causes</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost instant death--apoplexy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Capital!" exclaimed Grayson. "But are these small</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand weapons the only thing to be used against them ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No indeed. Among the prisoners in Capis there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient of the trinors hidden to account for the guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the surface. These are to be used as soon as our</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-fliers reach the island. Then each of the vessels</seg><seg type="columnLine">will swoop down upon the city, emitting the waves from</seg><seg type="columnLine">great generators that are set in the outer hulls. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">will cover considerable areas and will account for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the Prags. The prisoners will then rush to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city and the vessels will land at the same time, sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth their fighting men into the streets. The generators</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard our ships will keep up constant emission of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful vibrations and the rest will have be done by</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to hand fighting. Not a Prag must be allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson thrilled to the call of battle. The closer they</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew to the planet of the Prags the more bloodthirsty</seg><seg type="columnLine">he became.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is our protection against the gases and the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistols of the Prags?" he inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Against the gases we have newly perfected masks</seg><seg type="columnLine">which will be supplied before we land. Against the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">MICROCOSMIC BUCCANEERS	693</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol there is nothing. But we hope there will be few</seg><seg type="columnLine">left to use such weapons by the time our large generators</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gotten in their deadly work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are the odds against us--in numbers I mean ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About nine to one including the prisoners. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships there are forty-five hundred fighters and there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">about twice this number of prisoners in Capis. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are one hundred and twenty thousand Prags, so the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratio I mentioned is approximately correct."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, Captain," said Grayson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A lieutenant was distributing the gas masks and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought their conversation to an end. The captain busied</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself with the radiophone instrument through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">his orders were to come, and the soldiers gathered about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the windows where they were able to see the island of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capis with its black central city. The ship was crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the island and several others of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres could be seen converging on the same point--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a sudden vibration accompanying a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous, high-pitched scream from somewhere in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's vitals. Like the scream of the trinor this rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vanished, but the vibration persisted. The fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to begin!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The End of the Great Ones</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GRAYSON felt one of the gas masks thrust into</seg><seg type="columnLine">■his hand but he was too excited to pay much at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention. His face was pressed to the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he saw that several of the flapping-winged craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Prags were approaching their own vessel. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">close did they come, that he was able to see the ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulbous heads of the two Prags who occupied the nearest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he saw one of them go limp and slump forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his seat. The second followed suit and the wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">flapped crazily, out of control. The bird-like mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew drunkenly and then dashed headlong to earth send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up a cloud of dust as it crashed. The others of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious squadron quickly joined it at d ie knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave generators of their vessels were a success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Along the several roads that entered the city could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen scurrying groups of Elsians and kindred beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Rad and Aun. These were the prisoners, rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the mines and workshops in accordance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they were over the city and the nine spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled and swooped, their wave generators operating</seg><seg type="columnLine">at full capacity. From the square there rose one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylindrical Prag fliers and it headed directly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grayson's vessel. With a quick spurt the great sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and allowed the pointed metal cylinder to whiz</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmlessly past beneath them. It passed so closely that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could hear the rush of its slip-stream through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of the ship. Then it too went drunkenly reeling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting skyward and circling and diving, completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of control. Again the wave generators had proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">their worth. The huge cylinder went down in the midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tall ebon buildings, tearing away walls and roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">structures and carrying hundreds of Prags to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">deaths in the falling debris. Another of the Prag fliers</seg><seg type="columnLine">met a similar fate in an attempted attack on another of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spheres of the outlanders. There were cheers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grayson's companions and one and all they itched to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be outside and in the confusion that reigned in the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still the great spheres circled the city, spreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction beneath them. Two more of the Prag fliers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rose to the attack and one of the spheres went down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the successful rush of the first of the pointed vessels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the cylinder was carried to its doom along with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim for the swift rush had carried the pointed end</seg><seg type="columnLine">through and through the sphere where it stuck, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere impaled like an apple on a spike. The second</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder was dodged by its intended prey and soon went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to join its fellows. There remained but one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships in the square and the watchers could see that its</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew was deserting and making for the buildings on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the square. Grayson's sphere hovered a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the square, then settled gracefully to a landing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The order came to don gas masks and the hatches were</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out into the open filed the Elsian infantry, trinors</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand and looking fearfully inhuman with their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden behind the huge goggles of their masks. Dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dying Prags lay in heaps about the square and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to climb over piles of them in places in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make their way to the streets. A cloud of the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas descended on them and they fought their way blindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the tall building for which they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">started. Grayson stumbled over a body and fell heavily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he arose, he found that he was alone but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered his way through the murk until he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wall. He felt along this and fell through an opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">which proved to be the entrance of a building. Pushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the door, he rushed into the corridor, and here</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was none of the gas, and the lights were burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly. He removed his mask and looked around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEITHER Prag nor outlander was in sight and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately recognized this as the building that</seg><seg type="columnLine">housed the Great Ones. He heard a commotion nearby</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked down the corridor to investigate. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow hall that branched from the corridor he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of the Elsian prisoners struggling with one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower class Prags. As he reached them, there came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackling blue flare of the ray pistol and one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsians suddenly melted into horrid nothingness. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cry of rage he drew his own ray pistol, forgetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trinor, and the Prag turned wide eyes in his direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the blue flame struck him full in the chest. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining Elsian prisoners were saved and they spurned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shrinking mass of putrefaction that had been their</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy as they rushed to thank their rescuer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the assistance of these two slaves he located the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift and the three ascended to the uppermost floor. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged under the transparent roof and Grayson grimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">set forth to beard the Great Ones in their den, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsians protesting in fear. He paid no heed to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest warnings but proceeded steadily along the aisle</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the rank growths that had disgusted him so</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they first reached the place. When he had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a point about fifty feet from the dais where he was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden from the cushions of the Great Ones by foliage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came the mental command to stop. But instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreating at this evidence that the fearsome rulers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Prags were in their accustomed places, he pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the catch of his trinor and waited until the whine of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism had risen to the vanishing point. The Elsian</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves retreated precipitately, but Grayson advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly and cautiously in the direction of the dais.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly he felt the paralyzing force creeping over him</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he pressed doggedly forward, using every ounce of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength in his body to drag his benumbed limbs into</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement. Then he fell heavily to the floor and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">694</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to pull himself along by grasping the vines and tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunks along the path with his stiffening fingers. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in view of the dais now and he saw that two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Ones had fallen victims to the air vibrations, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal, hairless heads having dropped to the cushions</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which they rested. But the third, though weakening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still alive and it was this one that was exerting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">will power on the hapless earth man. With a final</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate effort Grayson twisted that rigid member that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his right arm until he was able to reach the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol in his belt. But he could not aim it in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the remaining Great One. He struggled and fought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that arm would not move. Then he concentrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with closed eyes. He spoke aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Grayson R36B," he growled through clamped jaws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you're not going to let this devil of a Prag get the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you--you're not. You must lift that arm and blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from existence--you must--you must!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, miraculously, he found he could move his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers--a bit at a time he edged his right arm forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking and grunting and berating himself aloud. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray pistol was levelled at the monstrosity that glared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him from among the cushions. Came the blue flare</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was released. His own will power had saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and he sprang to his feet with a cry of victory. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsian slaves came running and they capered in glee at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight that greeted them from the dais. The power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Great Ones was no more!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When eventually they reached the square, all of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spherical vessels were landed and the fighting had spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the side streets. There was not a living Prag in sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Grayson made his way to his own vessel to report</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Erne. He found him at the radiophone and greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a broad smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What have you to report, Grayson," the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have killed the Great Ones," he replied simply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What? Killed--the--Great--Ones?" was the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credulous reply. "Alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For that deed you will receive the highest honors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">decorations that can be conferred by the Governor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">general of Els. You will be famous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the earth man cared not. He was tired and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to go back to Els--to Lola.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Administration Building Gone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR three days they remained on the planet Pra,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploring every nook and cranny that might hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">a skulking Prag. Communications from Trasa</seg><seg type="columnLine">told of the victory over the Prag vessel that was quart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered there. The golden sphere told them that the vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the shore of Lake Ilo had not beai molested, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsians desired to learn more concerning the experiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were being conducted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Erne told him of this, Grayson groaned. "Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain," he said, "I can tell them all they wish to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those experiments. And my friend Minott can tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them more. Tell them to destroy the Prags at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of the air vibrations. I fear for Minott's</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety and I fear for my own world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it is impossible for me to give orders to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">superiors," Erne objected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then send one of our ships back.. Send me with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'll lay the case before the authorities. I tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain, there is much at stake--much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grayson was pleading now. He knew that it would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be necessary for the greater part of the force to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Capis for several more days to make sure the job had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been well done. But he pleaded for Minott, for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own peoples. And eventually Erne took it up with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commander of the expedition. After much explaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Grayson's part, it was finally arranged that one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spheres was to return him to Arun, and that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be allowed to tell his story to the Governor there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He expressed his gratitude in no uncertain terms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened to board the vessel that was assigned to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">him back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the short voyage he worried constantly. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that the spherical flier was desperately slow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though in reality it made the trip in record time--less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than three ul being required.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they approached the city of Arun, Grayson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the control room, talking with the pilot. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gasped in alarm. The great pointed cylinder that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the Prag's vessel lay crushed in the ruins of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once been the Administration Building! A vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">curl of white told of the Prag gas cloud that was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet fully cleared from the streets!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are too late!" he moaned, "The three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">maidens were quartered, in that building!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pilot looked at him commiseratingly. "You had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sweetheart among them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Grayson replied. He choked and paled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pilot maneuvered the ship to as quick a landing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No sooner were they on solid ground when the earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man donned his gas mask and demanded that he be</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed to leave the vessel. Upon the pilot's explaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">of matters to the captain this was allowed and Grayson</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed into the ruins of the building, crawling under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great metal hull of the Prag vessel to get into the debris.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought he could locate the chambers where Lola</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her father had been quartered and he risked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life in worming his way through caved-in corridors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broken-walled rooms until he reached this point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He found the body of Atar and mourned over it, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Elsian had been a life-long friend instead of a recent</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquaintance. But, try as he would he could find no</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace of Lola. He found many other bodies, a few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them of the young girls who were thought so safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">housed, but there was no evidence of either the death or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saving of the girl he had loved so quickly and deeply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He crawled from the debris and rushed frantically to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship which had brought him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last vestige of the gas was now cleared away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found a crowd collected about the entrance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mammoth sphere. Among them was the Governor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grayson elbowed his way to his side. The pilot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel was there and he acted as the earth man's inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Were many of the three hundred saved?" he first</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Patiently he waited for the translations. This Governor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not as adept at picking up his language, as had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been some of the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. More than two hundred were rescued."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Governor had a list and he looked through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully for the name of Lola. It was not there!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The raid had come unexpectedly, it seemed. Out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clear sky the enemy had appeared and had laid down</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas clouds in several sections of the city. A portable</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave generator was finally brought into action and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was sent down out of control--unfortunately</seg><seg type="columnLine">MICROCOSMIC BUCCANEERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">695</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">directly atop the Administration Building. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of casualties throughout Arun. But the High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Command had not suspected that such a thing would</seg><seg type="columnLine">transpire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn the High Command!" said Grayson. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wrong, and I have lost Lola--probably Minott too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He remained in the city, sick at heart. For three</seg><seg type="columnLine">days the wrecking crews searched the demolished build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, bringing many bodies for identification. But Lola</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not among them. When the casualty lists were</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete and neither she nor Minott were accounted for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grayson had an inspiration. Maybe Minott had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">left behind! Maybe he was still at Lake Ilo! He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">go and find out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ATTEMPTS to communicate with the village were</seg><seg type="columnLine">-tifutile, so the Governor provided a ronsal to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth man to the village. Before he left, there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the general broadcast advising that the remaining three</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsian spheres had left Pra and were on their way home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The celebration over the complete victory was starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his ronsal left the city limits, but there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">jubilation in Grayson's heart. He was bitter; broken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the ronsal reached the site of the village they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it in complete ruin. The Prags had destroyed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they left for Arun! But, looking out toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake, it was seen that the huts that covered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimental mechanisms were still standing. Grayson</seg><seg type="columnLine">made all haste to reach them and he searched first one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the others of the rude shelters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Grayson!" came a familiar and beloved voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Minott stood before him and the younger man fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his knees and thanked God that the Prags had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him behind. Minott raised him gently to his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">led him to the largest of the shelters, thrusting him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door without a word. There in a chair that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had built when they first came, sat Lola!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young man stopped in his tracks and gazed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her with unbelieving eyes. Then they embraced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Minott gave them plenty of time; then he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the open door and coughed gently. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">beamed and explanations came fast and furiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half crazed at the death of her father, Lola had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">her way to the village only to find it in ruins. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapsed, but by good fortune Minott found her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nursed her back to health. It was a happy reunion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three embraced in a huddle from sheer joy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a tremendous wrench, a twisting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">warping of the universe, and they stood in Minott's</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory--three where there had been but two before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lola still clung to her lover but Minott sprang to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">super-microscope and shut off the power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What on earth?" gasped Grayson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Minott glanced at the clock and laughed. "My boy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said "our two minutes have expired. Our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus brought us back, thanks to the time switch."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mean to say that all of that grief took place</seg><seg type="columnLine">during two minutes of our time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Absolutely. The time-space relationship you see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those long days in the atom universe were but fractions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a second here. The Elsians and the Prags and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them lived out their lifetimes in less than one of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">days.

He drew her still more closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">in awful fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course.

Save</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a servant, he lived alone in a huge old house at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one edge of town. This servant made most of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">contacts with the world, as the colonel kept no car and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seldom went abroad, except for an occasional stroll at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night through the fields thereabouts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps Murphy, his man, might have told something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him, certainly he bore for Murphy an affection that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not conceived in a day, while Murphy in return ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered service that betokened more than habit or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to cling to an assured position. But I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know; Murphy is dead. Whatever he knew of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that made a prosperous chemist drop out of sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world and live as a recluse for the remainder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life, has died with him. I feel that even were he</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive, there was sufficient of an impelling force behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colonel's actions and enough of a tie between them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to insure his silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What I have to say bears on Colonel Grigsby's former</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and his character other than as I saw him, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">secondarily. Yet a full knowledge of that life might tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me whether or not I saw a phenomenon unparalleled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the history of science or whether I beheld only {he</seg><seg type="columnLine">vagaries of a paretic playing with scientific toys, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravings of a decaying mind which took its strange bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the years it had spent in chemical and mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuits. If I, as a physician, cannot decide on the data</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hand, it is doubtful if any one can. Yet I frankly</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot say that I am sure of what I saw, whether the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonel's experiments were far ahead of anything known</seg><seg type="columnLine">even now or whether the colonel himself was possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the almost diabolical cunning that appears sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a disordered mind and which led him to impose upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me an enormous hoax.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I can only relate what I know and hope that perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one will bring forth enough information on his early</seg><seg type="columnLine">life to let me decide. If his were a cracked mind, as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">actions in leaving the world and burying himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bolton to go on with his experiments, as well as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of the experiments themselves, might indicate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely some indications of it must have appeared before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why all record of his work at Pittsburgh has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried in the oblivion of nameless files is another phase</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mystery. One thing only I know, my own attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">at investigation has failed. Perhaps some one who reads</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, despite the changes in names and places, may recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nize the story and come forward with additional facts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MY acquaintance with Colonel Grigsby (I can hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">call it friendship, although I was the nearest thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a friend that he had in Bolton) dated from a visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his house early in January of the year he died. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in practice in Bolton about three months, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard references to the "Old Hermit" and his exclusive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, and had seen the house, always heavily shuttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and surrounded by a high and solid, if somewhat dilapi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dated, wall. Therefore it was a surprise when I received</seg><seg type="columnLine">a call one night in a gruff voice to "come in a hurry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring bandage and sewing stuff along." The call was</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Colonel Grigsby's house on the hill south of town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hurriedly packed my bag with emergency supplies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove to the gate in the wall around the house. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was met by the servant, whom I later learned to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murphy, and was conducted through a path winding</seg><seg type="columnLine">between clumps of rose bushes to a side door, that led</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly into the colonel's library.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remember that it was a quiet moonlight night, very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mild for January, and with just a light coat of snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the fields, on the wall, and on the uncared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes on the lawn. The house stood at the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill; beyond the gate the road stretched in a gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord to terminate in the shadows around the clump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights marking the village. Above me as I stood at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, while Murphy fumbled with a stubborn latch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a dark height of wall, a full three stories and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dormer gable. On every side was moonlight, making the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house seem more foreboding, as no answering gleam came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the darkly shrouded pile. There was nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieve its black expanse and I recall noting these sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings and idly wondering if perhaps the villagers'</seg><seg type="columnLine">hints of something "fey" in the resident of the hill might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have started from someone's view of the house and</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden in the moonlight. There was indeed something</seg><seg type="columnLine">eerie in the scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within the library the illusion was lost. Here was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">conventional large room lined with well filled book-cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">and furnished sparely yet tastefully with solid old-fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned furniture. It was brilliantly lighted by a row of</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric bulbs running completely around the cornice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lack of light without was explained by heavy velvet</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtains drawn to completely cover a number of long</seg><seg type="columnLine">French windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Murphy indicated my patient with a nod and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared through a door opposite to the one through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had entered. On the other side of the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">the figure of a man was lying quietly on a day-bed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dressed in an old shirt and trousers and,carpet</seg><seg type="columnLine">slippers and wore over all a long and heavy laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">apron. On the floor, as though thrown away in haste,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a pair of heavy goggles with shining thick lenses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">borders of grey rubber. His left arm lay on a chair by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of the couch and was covered with blood-stained</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I approached he opened his eyes and greeted me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a weak voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've cut my arm, doctor, and I think the cubital vein</seg><seg type="columnLine">is severed. Murphy applied a tourniquet and some band-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages but it is still seeping slowly and I've lost consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able blood. Murphy will be here in a moment with hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">water; you may examine it and do what is necessary."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment Murphy entered with a large basin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water that still boiled and I removed the dressings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gently sponged away the blood so that I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cubital vein was cut; a deep gash extending across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forearm had severed skin, fascia, and muscle, down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the tendons. Blood still seeped slowly from the sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered vessels; only the prompt application of a tourniquet</seg><seg type="columnLine">had saved him from a death by hemorrhage. As it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had lost enough blood to make him pale. His pulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strong and not too rapid, and I decided to apply</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligatures and sutures rather than to risk moving him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I inquired if he thought he could stand the pain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sewing and he smiled weakly and told me to go ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did, however, administer an opiate both to lessen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain and to minimize the danger of renewed hemorrhage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It took a number of stitches to catch the bleeding vessels</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then eight or ten more to approximate the cut muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and skin, but he stood it all without a murmur. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it was bandaged he was nearly asleep. I left a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple instructions with Murphy, who all this time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood by my side, evidently anxious to help, yet not ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turing to do so without my bidding. Telling him I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">return in the morning, I took my leave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BRAIN ACCELERATOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">699</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I returned next day I found the Colonel at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his desk, pale and evidently weak, but cheerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">and busy with some sort of drawing. When I entered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dropped his work and greeted me pleasantly and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had an opportunity to observe him more fully than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could the evening before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was tall, spare rather than stout, and even seated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he carried his shoulders back and his spine erect in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of one who has spent time in the army. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">face partook of the leanness of his body; there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm chin and full, tight lips; a straight, large nose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grey eyes and a high forehead and the whole was topped</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a shock of curly white hair. He wore a conventional</seg><seg type="columnLine">business suit with the bandaged arm buttoned into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat, and presented a picture of some elderly college</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor at work in his study, rather than the eccentric</seg><seg type="columnLine">recluse that the village gossip had painted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seen in daylight there was nothing unusual about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">library. The velvet curtains had been drawn back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room was flooded with sunshine. There were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of books lying on the desk, a few drawing in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struments, a slide-rule, and sheets of drafting paper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In cases lining the walls were hundreds of other books</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I saw through a half opened door a large room, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be fitted as a laboratory or workshop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I mentally catalogued the Colonel as some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist; a chemist, perhaps, or from the drawings pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly an engineer. Certainly there was nothing about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place or the man to suggest anything more than an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual with a hobby who desired privacy to work out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ideas at leisure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I dressed the wound, the Colonel talked pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antly, inquired about my school and hospital experience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how long I had been in Bolton, and whether or not I</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to remain in country practice, since so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">young physicians seemed to prefer the city. I told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had located there partly because it was a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening; the nearest physician being in the next town</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten miles away; and partly because in this place was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">State Institution for the Feeble Minded, and that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment on the staff permitted me excellent clinical</seg><seg type="columnLine">facilities for research in psychiatry, which I hoped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make my specialty. The Colonel's interest seemed caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this and he asked a number of questions that betrayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a cursory insight into physiology in general</seg><seg type="columnLine">and particularly in the little understood physiology of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. He soon dropped the subject and did not reopen</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, although it seemed to me at the time that he appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take more than a layman's interest in the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wound developed an infection in a few days and</seg><seg type="columnLine">required frequent irrigations to clean it up. I visited</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house on the hill daily for nearly three weeks, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that time came to feel quite at home with the Colonel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was always friendly and always interesting. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">told tales of the war in which I learned that he had served</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the field units of the British forces; he told of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">college days at Cambridge, and he admitted that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied medicine for three years, before he entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">army. He spoke of research in the laboratories at Pitts-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burgh and mentioned that he had several patents on basic</seg><seg type="columnLine">processes in the manufacture of metals. Sometimes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked of my own work, quizzing me on brain and nerve</seg><seg type="columnLine">anatomy, and taking frank delight in catching me in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional error. Where he gained the fund of informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that he had on the subject, he never said; I am sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, that he must have done a great deal of work</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it at some time, because his knowledge frequently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">surpassed my own, and I had spent every spare moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in college upon that phase of anatomy and physiology.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I began to enjoy these visits; a physician in a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">town has little opportunity to talk shop, and the Colonel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge, while always from the viewpoint of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">student and not the physician, was remarkable. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">argued and speculated and discussed the reports in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current medical journals, and long after the wound had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to require my services I dropped in once or twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week in the evening. I had free time, my practice</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually was taken care of during the day and I went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sanitarium only on Saturdays, so that I learned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look forward with pleasure to our evenings together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How the Colonel filled his days he did not explain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His laboratory was closed when I came at night; Murphy</seg><seg type="columnLine">would quietly set out cigars and a bottle of port of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Colonel seemed fond, and as quietly retire. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked sometimes until midnight without ever touching</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon personal activities. What experiments he was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducting or whether he was writing, I did not inquire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were both apparently content to enjoy each other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">company without too much of the usual intimacy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE night, perhaps two months after the Colonel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound had healed, and after our habit of discussion</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become quite well established, I entered his library</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find him seated by his desk apparently in a brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">study. He nodded absently to me as Murphy took my</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat and hat, and he motioned me toward a chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereafter said nothing until I was seated and enjoying</seg><seg type="columnLine">my cigar, which I had lighted. Then he pushed back his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair and asked me abruptly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the nature of nerve impulse, Doctor ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caught off guard by his sudden plunge into matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific, since we usually drifted leisurely into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">phase of our talks, and moreover fearful of a trick in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">question, I temporized:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, of course, no one knows. There are several</seg><seg type="columnLine">theories, one that it is a chemical process, another that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is purely electrical in nature and another that it is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vital phenomenon for which nerve tissue has the inherent</seg><seg type="columnLine">capability. I believe that the electrical theory has the</seg><seg type="columnLine">support of most physiologists now, although it is still</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unsettled matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right," he said, "except for the last state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Mathews, along with Koch and Alexander, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved that the nerve impulse extended along the fibre</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some chemical process similar to the sudden break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down of a peroxide or organic oxide, but they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">never able to prove the release of heat, which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been inevitable had they been right. Tashiro</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, when he demonstrated motility in the dendritic</seg><seg type="columnLine">processes of growing nerve tissue, that he had the answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a mechano-vital affair, but he was wrong. It has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been proved that it is electrical and I have proved it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">With this simple yet startling statement did the Colo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel introduce me to the trend of his researches. I started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to question, but he broke in impatiently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know you are going to ask for proof, but let that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait.

Walls, ceil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and floor were tiled, green at the top and with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower three feet of the walls and the floor white. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no windows; in recesses in the walls were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed lamps, that gave a flood of glareless, shadowless</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumination so white as to closely resemble sunlight. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side was a long bench cluttered with chemical ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus, test tubes, retorts, and burners. At one end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it stood a miniature electric furnace and I recalled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel's words about metallurgical research. The wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest the door had a table running its whole length and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this was a bewildering array of wires and vacuum</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulbs and huge X-ray tubes. In the ell, of which I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see one end, seemed to be two or three dynamos and</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors and what I at once recognized as the high fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quency generator of an X-ray machine, although it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger than any I had ever seen. Attached by long in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulators to the ceiling was a row of heavy copper bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">that extended to the bench with the vacuum tubes.

The animal was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid; the heart was silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the eyes were fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dull; it seemed to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have been dead some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, despite the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no signs of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">composition. The Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted the tubes to connec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions in the top of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, similar to the ones in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first. He threw an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other switch and the tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted. Carefully adjust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a diaphragm arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment similar to the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage condenser of a microscope, he brought the green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish ray to a small focus and training it upon the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the head of the dead dog, broadened it until it cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the whole skull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems to require considerable stimulation at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first raying," he explained. "There," he narrowed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam again to a point about the size of a dime and just</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the junction of the neck and the head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOTHING happened for a moment, but as I watched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rigid limbs began to relax and the tail moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly; the Colonel reached in quickly and gave a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust upon the thorax, and to my amazement, respira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion began. Labored at first and somewhat jerky, it soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled to a regular rhythm and upon the floor of the cage</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay, instead of the dead dog that bad been there, one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed only asleep. The Colonel invited me to feel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest and I found the heart pumping steadily. Upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning back the eyelids, I saw that the dull film was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone and as a ray of light reflected from the glass upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, the pupils contracted to their normal size. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">questionably, unless I were the victim of an illusion, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dog was alive, asleep truly, but none the less alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Colonel shut the door of the case and snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">another switch. "The temperature in here is kept at 98</seg><seg type="columnLine">degrees but the internal temperature of the body falls</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly below that when metabolism ceases, and it takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">some little time for it to return. Also, it will take a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes before the dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be ready for the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the experiment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Colonel led the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the library, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">we again sat down. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred questions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming in my mind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling there with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctant conviction that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had really witnessed what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost a miracle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Noting his expression,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that the Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">had something further to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, I awaited him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">methodically selected a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar, lighted it, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stressed my contention on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the type of nerve travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse too strongly. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems that the ray you</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw must be electrical in</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature and that the reac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead dog to it partakes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the implantation upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous system of an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traneous electrical impulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">which stimulates a quies-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent, yet not extinct func-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. But I am not sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all. That ray will</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrate flesh, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal if the metal be</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounded. It makes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clatter in an ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio very much like old-fashioned summer static. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it is electrical, but I've never proved it, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as soon as I discovered it, I fell upon its peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect upon nerve tissue and I have followed that line</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclusively since.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I neglected to tell you that before those dogs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">chloroformed to death, they were each given sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">alkali salts intravenously to insure alkalinization of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain tissue and so lessen the autolysis which occurs less</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the brain, as you know, than in the body, but which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">still appreciable within a few hours after death. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were quite dead, every possible bit of blood was</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrawn from them, defibrinated to prevent clot, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace of arsenic to check body decay was added, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood pumped back. The dog which you saw first has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been there three weeks, apparently asleep, the low, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary metabolism being supported by a few grams</seg><seg type="columnLine">of glucose given intravenously each day. The second</seg><seg type="columnLine">was killed two days ago and," he smiled, "has been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject of further experiment which I hope to re-enact</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you in a few moments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sufficient time has elapsed for the dog to have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BRAIN ACCELERATOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">U'Mli</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;L</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">703</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gained his normal metabolic rate, as you might say, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be accustomed to living again, so let us return to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Colonel opened the case and examined the dog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt its body and pried open the jaws to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue.

A high frequency generator, something</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an old-fashioned wireless telegraph transmitter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped into life with a hiss and crackle and instantly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenish beam became suffused with a million tiny flashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of red that shot from the small or auxiliary X-ray tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">and corruscated from the screen down its length. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog, as the combined ray struck him, moved his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Colonel adjusted a dial and the red flashes increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">in intensity; the dog stirred further and in a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes and raised his head to look about. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched and yawned, just as a man might upon awaken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from a natural sleep. The Colonel stopped the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chinery and spoke to him sharply. He rose and nosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass next the Colonel in friendly greeting. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel opened the door of the cage and out jumped an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently normal dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He staggered a moment as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he struck the floor, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to recover h i s</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. The Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">called his name affection-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately and the dog went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and leaped up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every demonstration of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pet who has just found</seg><seg type="columnLine">his master after long sepa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Colonel stooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and patted his head for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment and sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his stool.

The Colonel mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned me to the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">stool, and drawing cigars</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his pocket, offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to me. While he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumbled for a match he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be pondering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 LOOKED at him ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectantly. I had wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed something beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ordinary experience of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and it seemed better</seg><seg type="columnLine">to await his lead before</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunging into the mass of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">questions that came to my mind in quick succession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought for at least a full minute and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">started upon an apparently irrelevant subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bruno was my pet for years. Was I right to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">him? It looks," he seemed to be arguing with himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an abstracted way, "like betraying a friend. Yet, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other has been unharmed for two weeks and I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much Bruno knows and he trusts me enough to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">co-operate as much as any animal can. Besides"--then</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly seeming to recall my presence, he looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a quick smile and said half apologetically, "Murphy</seg><seg type="columnLine">rated me soundly for using Bruno in my experiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I have a whole roomful of curs over there." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated the door leading from the ell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After I found out how to handle the ray, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to affect them only slightly after the experiment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and for the next thing I want to show you I need</seg><seg type="columnLine">an animal of proven intelligence. Other than an apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">need for sleep and a tendency to lose weight, they seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal afterward and it is not convenient to use a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange dog when he cannot be confined during the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," falling once more into his usual manner, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told you that I had something further to show you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I meant something more than this resuscitation. I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">very elated over that, though I doubt if it will ever be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a toy as regards its use on humans, until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone further along the line that I indicated by my</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk on silent areas of the brain. Oh, I know," as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to speak, "there are a thousand phases of the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be worked out, but I am interested now only in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have seen that I revived this dead dog by apply-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through this ray a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stimulant which started</seg><seg type="columnLine">anew the vital processes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we call life, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seem to have their</seg><seg type="columnLine">center in the brain. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether, as I said before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is a chemical affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">which stopped with death</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was started again by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of catalytic ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion due to the application</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the suitable electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge, or whether it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">purely electrical and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">such answered to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper electrical v i b r a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, I do not know.

Come, Bruno."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He awakened the sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dog, who seemed reluctant to stir, and led him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spot on the floor near the glass cabinet. A word or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the dog lay down again and in a moment was asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Colonel swung a long metal arm out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, and after adjusting a clamp, reached into the cabinet</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the tubes. Working quickly yet carefully, he soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had them in place and after connecting longer wires to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contacts, stepped toward the bench and threw the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I have tried it on myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">704</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">switch. The tubes lighted and he again turned them out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then removed the condensing shutter from the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and replaced it with another and larger one. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished, I saw that the apparatus with its larger con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denser swung on an arm with its active side over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog and freely adjustable in any direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time when he threw the switch, the greenish glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in a wide-spread cone, which he carefully nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed until it just embraced the whole form of the dog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Colonel adjusted another control and threw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch that started the stream of reddish sparks down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beam. This time, however, the corruscations were</seg><seg type="columnLine">more purple in color, and as he moved the control still</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, they changed to the violet of an ordinary Hertzian</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharge, glancing down the cone of light like a flood of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny lightnings. There was also a continuous crackling</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise like that from a spark gap and I detected the tin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling fragrance of ozone in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT first the dog gave no sign of effect from the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">. but soon he raised his head and seemed to awaken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Colonel locked the control he had been moving, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped to the tube and adjusted the condenser mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anism until the dog lay in the center of a green circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">about ten feet in diameter. He lay there quietly, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head raised and his eyes open until the Colonel spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name, then he turned to look and finally stood, exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he were giving the Colonel his attention or awaiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a command.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 he Colonel walked to the bench and selected a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of objects, a large cork mat, some test tubes and pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bent glass tubing. He laid them upon the floor at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the cone of light and spoke to the dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bruno, bring me the piece of cork."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The animal quietly walked over, picked it up in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and brought it to his master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now bring the long piece of glass with the curve at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were two pieces of tubing that were both long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bent, but one was curved in the middle and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other twisted into a curve at one end.

Looking at my watch I was surprised to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">it already two o'clock in the morning and some hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">past my usual bed time. I aroused the Colonel and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned off the machine in unspoken agreement that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was time to suspend our experiments for the night. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned off the laboratory lights and led the way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">library, leaving the dog quietly sleeping on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">\ATE both seemed surprisingly tired for the amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">' » of exertion we had undergone, even considering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unusual mental turmoil that the weird experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">had occasioned. The Colonel seemed lost in thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I relaxed in a chair without energy to propound</seg><seg type="columnLine">the questions or advance the suggestions that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamoring in my mind. The Colonel poured wine for</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of us, and under its genial cheer, I felt refreshed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You have seen," he said, "that the ray I demonstrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">appears to be electrical in character and that it has the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power not only to keep an animal in a state of uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness for an indefinite period, but that it also seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to revive the dead when no actual dissolution of tissue</seg><seg type="columnLine">has taken place. I may as well say now that this latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomenon does not occur unless the proper care as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">alkalinization of the tissues and for the prevention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clotting of the blood is taken, hence, my pessimism as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its applicability in human therapy. At first, every dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried it upon failed to respond if it had been dead more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than three minutes; it was only after I had taken steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the method of Koch to prevent tissue autolysis that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I obtained results over that period.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "However, to return to our subject. The ray, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some process yet to be explained, but which seems to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical, affects the nervous system of an animal so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it remains in a state of almost suspended animation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a variation in its nature causes a nervous system</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is extinct as to function, to reassume and enact the</seg><seg type="columnLine">characteristics of life. It further causes in a live dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">an increase in nervous activity with an attendant increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">in cerebration that unquestionably raises the mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the animal to an unthought of degree."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Upon my word, Doctor, the acts you saw the dog per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form tonight were not the result of training.

The officer, roused</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his stupor, became the picture of action, brandish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his weapon and prancing about with extreme agita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. But what to shoot ? where to shoot ? How can one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter how well-meaning his intentions may be, shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an invisible target? Lem Turner peered about in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions, but the enveloping blackness was unbroken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for an occasional flash and twinkle of light, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">firefly flitted past.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous face appeared to be suspended at about the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their eyes and was no more than five feet distant from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.

The glowing lips parted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a smile. Then suddenly a luminous hand emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the gloom--a thin, bony hand that emitted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same bluish-white light as the face--and gently touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lem Turner's arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen--I beg your par-!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The touch of the ghostlike hand and the sound of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow, sepulchral tones that came forth from the lumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nous cavity that represented the mouth of the face served</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break the spell into which the two horrified spectators</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been cast. Galvanized into violent action once again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turner sprang a step to the rear and bellowed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand back there!--be you ghost or man or whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are!--I'm goin' to slioot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quick as a flash the luminous apparition was gone--</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, hand and all.

Lem Turner and Bill Sheridan, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only eye-witnesses of the astonishing visitation, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">besieged with questions. A luminous face ? What busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness did such an unearthly thing have, prowling around</seg><seg type="columnLine">those peaceful parts ? The puzzled citizenry shook their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads in bewilderment and assisted in scouring the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediate vicinity with lanterns and torches in the hope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scaring the inhuman being, whatever it was, out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. They beat the thicket in all directions, flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lights behind the bushes and into every possible hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing place and even up into the branches of all trees in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighborhood, but the hunt was fruitless. The mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous night prowler, whether human or supernatural, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">effected a clean escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a single soul in the village of Bakersville slept a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wink that night.

But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous face did not make itself visible again for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remainder of the night. The following evening, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, the Widow Galey was terrified almost into insensi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility by the sudden flashing of the same glowing face at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her kitchen window. An hour or so later the Phillips'</seg><seg type="columnLine">hired man stumbled precipitously into the living room of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farmhouse with his face bearing a death-like pallor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his teeth chattering and his eyes rolling wildly. Between</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasps he reported having seen the horrifying spectacle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a human head and torso, all ablaze in a lurid brilliance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving rapidly down the road. The shoulders, chest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back were bare and gleamed brightly in the darkness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road. The luminous arms swung briskly and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire torso, ending abruptly at the waistline, jogged</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the highway, suspended above the ground at just</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the normal height of a human body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FEELING was now beginning to run high in Bakers-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ville at this mystifying spectre.

Outside of scaring a few of the good village</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk half out of their wits, the bold visitor had demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strated himself as totally innocuous. But what did this</seg><seg type="columnLine">all mean ? What was the explanation for such unearthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">doings? Many were the theories and conjectures ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounded and debated in the attempt to solve the puzzle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Butler, the village pharmacist, was of the opinion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">some practical joker was making ingenious use of lumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nous paint and was enjoying a good laugh at the expense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the terrorized populace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just some calcium or zinc sulphide," he argued, "is</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that's necessary to make a good luminous paint that'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine in the dark.

Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that the luminosity of this strange character was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a phenomenon akin to the phosphorescent glowing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">damp wood in a forest. Some scamp, they argued, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">employing an extract or derivative from damp wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which extract he coated his body in order to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some innocent fun with the inhabitants of the vicinity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A iew scoffers opined that the whole scheme was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">advertising stunt to gain publicity for some new cigarette,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus pave the way for a huge selling campaign in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">countryside. A half dozen of the more religiously in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clined members of the community insisted that it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign from heaven, a mystic symbol or warning to a sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning world that the Day of Judgment was close at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The luminous visitor continued to appear from time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in various parts of the vicinity. Now he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerge as merely a glowing face flitting through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrubbery along a dark road or coursing in and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the trees. Then he would be reported as patrol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing an unfrequented region among the nearby hills,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped to the waist, with half his body glowing brightly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On one occasion, two boys, skirting the mill pond one</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, sultry night, were startled to see the luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger disporting himself in the cool waters, his entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">body glowing with a brilliant sheen that was reflected in</seg><seg type="columnLine">myriad ripples of luminescence as he dived and splashed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His sole garment, so the boys reported, appeared to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminutive pair of dark bathing trunks which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost invisible in contrast with the blinding brilliance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rest of his body. The awed spectators of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable performance remained concealed as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they dared and then fled in a panic as he approached their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reports of the unearthly happenings about Bakersville</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread far and wide. News reporters and editorial</seg><seg type="columnLine">writers devoted considerable space to the exploits of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious visitor. Although he confined his luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitations to only a narrow locality, his fame extended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remotest parts of the land. The "Human Firefly"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the appellation given to him by those who witnessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his recurring appearances. The title was a singularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">appropriate one, for like a firefly he would suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst into a blaze of light and then flash off again as by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressing of a magic switch. People spoke in awed</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispers about him, and many a fearful glance was cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">over many a shoulder as a hunched figure hastened down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lonely road or through a deserted street after dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">The "Colite Luminor"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN young Walter Graham entered Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hament's laboratory as general assistant, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a feeling of profound admiration for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable scientist and deep fascination for the absorb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing problem with which his giant intellect was struggling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arthur T.

And the problem--</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold light!--the dream of modern science was now, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">those three years of ceaseless and painstaking experimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation, on the very verge of realization. Up there in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">little laboratory that perched on the hilltop just outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village of Bakersville the secret of the firefly and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow-worm was slowly being wrested from reluctant</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature to be put to practical use by mankind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walter carefully set down the flask of fluorescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid, turned off the pet-cock that was bubbling a steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of gas through the apparatus and sauntered over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the open window that admitted the refreshing breeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a midsummer evening. He was in a ruminative frame</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mind, something of extreme rarity in those crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">days and nights of assiduous experimenting and testing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and observation and planning. Busy months they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, months of unparalleled absorption in the profound</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem. -Of setbacks there had been many and discour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agements galore, but ever the two workers--the indom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itable scientist and his eager assistant--had plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">onward in the struggle for the precious secret. Now it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost within reach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walter gazed dreamily out upon the shadowy land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scape, dotted here and there with the intermittent flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings of innumerable fireflies as they flitted in and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the warm atmosphere. He smiled to himself as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought of how green and inexperienced he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">when first he joined forces with Dr. Hament in his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiring task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Man, he thought, might well pride himself upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">development of heat, light and electricity, upon which</seg><seg type="columnLine">present-day comfort is so largely dependent. Should</seg><seg type="columnLine">these modern wonders suddenly disappear, their absence</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be sorely missed. But, reflected the young scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist, methods of producing heat, light and electricity have</seg><seg type="columnLine">long been possessed by living creatures, which have equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment far different from man's crude furnace, lamp or</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamo. And crude they were indeed, young Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">pondered, and smiled inwardly at the thought of how</seg><seg type="columnLine">poorly man's devices compare with the ingenious mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isms found in nature. In the matter of heat production,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mammals and birds maintain their body temperature</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually above that of their surroundings. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxidation of food in their tissues they may be said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">possess eternal fires, and their efficient system of thermo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regulation makes them independent of cold. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms of marine life, such as the electric fish, young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham mused, can generate a considerable current of</seg><seg type="columnLine">electricity, sufficient even to ring a bell or light an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">candescent lamp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was in the field of bioluminescence, the produc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of light by living organisms, where Graham's</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts lingered fondly. That was the work to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chief and idol, Dr. Hament, had devoted his life, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work which held out so much inspiration and promise to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young scientist. Walter smiled at the memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time when he viewed the remarkable phenomenon</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the phosphorescence or "burning of the sea"--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water a vivid sheet of flame when disturbed by a passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," Dr. Hament had explained to him at the time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"is one of the most interesting examples of biolumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nescence. Some very fantastic theories have been ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced to account for this strange occurrence. At one</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the belief was held that the light owed its origin</seg><seg type="columnLine">to putrefaction, because it has been known that dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter might, under certain conditions, become luminous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Others were of the opinion that it was due to the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of the element phosphorus in sea water, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed in the dark, as it used to glow 011 the head of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old time match. One scientist conjectured that the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">710</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the sea imbibed light during the day time, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it later discharged, much like a luminous paint made with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mineral such as calcium sulphide. Others believed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light of the sea was electric, because it was excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">by friction. But all of these theories are now obsolete.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It has been established beyond doubt that the phosphor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escence of the sea is due to animals living in it--most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them microscopic in size, as the dinoflagellates or nocti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luca, but many visible to the naked eye, such as the comb</seg><seg type="columnLine">jelly-fish (Ctcnophores)."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TI7ALTER had marveled at the old scientist's vast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ' ' fund of information, but had been elevated to su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preme heights of admiration when he first initiated him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the mystery of the firefly, and its method of cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">light production.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very few people," Dr. Hament had informed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"realize how many luminiscent organisms there are. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">survey of the animal kingdom reveals at least forty dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent orders containing one or more forms known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce light. In addition, at least two groups of plants</seg><seg type="columnLine">are luminscent, the fungi, which produce the phosphor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escence of damp wood, and the bacteria, which cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead meat or fish and other dead organic matter to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">off light."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The flitting sparks that denoted the tiny fireflies circled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flashed through the impenetrable darkness without.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The young experimenter tried to follow each evanescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash, and laughed to himself at his foolishness. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">vividly he remembered Dr. Hament's careful dissection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this marvelous little insect, and his lucid exposition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of how it produced its mysterious cold light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, Walter, look," the old scientist had said, indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating the specimen under the enlarging glass. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the common firefly, which, strictly speaking, is not a fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all, but a beetle, belonging to the family Lampyridae,</seg><seg type="columnLine">genera Pkotimis. Notice that the photogenic organ of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insect is located in the lower part of the abdomen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and consists of this ventral mass of large cells where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminescence originates, and directly behind another layer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of small cells which acts as the reflector. Observe these</seg><seg type="columnLine">large tracheal trunks or air tubes which pass into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light organ and branch out into every cell. These tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">give an abundant supply of oxygen to the photogenic</seg><seg type="columnLine">organ. Note also those white thread-like branches, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the nerves that control the luminescence. The thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube supplying the light-producing cells increases the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flow of oxygen and the light is intensified; the same air</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube, swayed by the insect's will, slackens or even sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pends the passage of air, and the light grows fainter, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">even goes out. It is, in short, the mechanism of a lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is regulated by the access of air to the wick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walter recalled with a thrill the zealous gleam in Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hament's eyes as he led to the topic that was closest to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart. "And there," were the tense words of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old scientist, "lies the secret of cold light, that remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably efficient luminescence of which the firefly is master,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which, when made available for the use of mankind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will revolutionize the field of illumination! That, my boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is our great problem. I have already done a good deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the preliminary work, but the problem is still far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a satisfactory solution. With your great help and co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation, with the benefit of your youthful vigor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination, coupled with your keen scientific insight, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am certain that we shall be able soon to present to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled and appreciative world the wonderful secret of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold light."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing there now by the open window of the labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, young Graham could not control the flush of em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassment that rose to his cheeks at the mere memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those impressive words, just as it mounted and over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed him in a stammering and incoherent confusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of speech on that occasion more than three years ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With vigorous determination, and a wealth of enthusiasm</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two had plunged into an interminable series of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">searches, involving the minutest detail and exactness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">procedure. They had gone deep into the field of mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phology, studying the form and arrangements of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structures possessed by plants and animals, in investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gating the cause of their luminescence. They had pored</seg><seg type="columnLine">over volumes on entymology, digging out bit by bit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrets of luminous insects. They had delved into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intricate chemistry of the light-producing medium, en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaging in a vast number of patient analyses and equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">painstaking syntheses. They had invaded the domain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the physicist in the study of the nature of bioluminescence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its physical measurements. They had penetrated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field of the illumination engineer in a minute study of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light control and light efficiency. Many of their experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments had ended in failure. Frequently, after a long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tedious series of steps, involving work of the minutest</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail, they had found themselves figuratively facing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank wall. After such a heartbreaking climax, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be compelled to retrace their steps, and laboriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">commence on a different tack. Long and arduous had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle been, and now victory was just around the corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walter's revery was broken by a footstep at the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the laboratory. Dr. Hament entered and sank wearily</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Human Firefly!" he laughed half to himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's not such a bad appellation, is it Walter ? But it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting to be a dangerous business, what with people</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting at me, and one thing or another. I believe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that the last injection of alpha-luciferin was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best so far. My control of oxidation was beautiful, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most as efficient as the original firefly itself. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of that infernal lag which troubled us so at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of our experiments with these subcutaneous</seg><seg type="columnLine">injections. And as for the brilliance of illumination, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am confident that the comparison will make that ambi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tious little insect hide its head in shame."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you think," asked his youthful assistant eagerly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that the three amino groups are now in their correct</seg><seg type="columnLine">position in the compound ? I was working all afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the preparations for another synthesis run, to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the groups in the 1:2:7 positions, and swing the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydroxyl back to its old place near the end of the second-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ary carbon chain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, my boy," replied Dr. Hament, "I believe we</seg><seg type="columnLine">now have the alpha-luciferin structure definitely fixed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its final form. We've got the problem just where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">want it, Walter," and with a merry laugh and an affec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionate hug, "we have now reached the point where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are going to 'out-glozv' the glow-worm!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Judging from what I have heard about the neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">borhood," smiled Graham, "and from the reports in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newspapers in this part of the state, you have created</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tremendous furore with your mystifying luminescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearances."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To be sure I have kicked up a considerable rumpus in</seg><seg type="columnLine">these parts," returned Dr. Hament with an amused</seg><seg type="columnLine">twinkle in his eyes, "and maybe I've put more of a scare</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the simple village folk than I really ought to have.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I can see where this vital information which we have in</seg><seg type="columnLine">COLD LIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">711</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">our possession would, in the hands of an individual with</seg><seg type="columnLine">malicious intentions, be a powerful influence for evil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, as I have already explained to you, my purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been to synthesize the photogenic material that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for the firefly's luminescence, study its physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal and chemical properties, and determine the conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">under which it may be put to a practical use in the solu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the problem of cold light. Of course, Walter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">human luminescence, as we have succeeded in perfecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, can have no real practical significance. And yet, out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of being a curious and an exceedingly romantic phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenon, it has served a useful purpose in enabling us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to garner a wealth of valuable information as to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism of the firefly's luminosity. Some day, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps after our main problem is solved, we'll come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and play around in this interesting field of human lumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nescence. I am confident that we shall discover some</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of prolonging the virility of the alpha-luciferin in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jection beyond its present short life of only a few hours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is one undeniable benefit, however, which will ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crue to our cause by virtue of my nightly prowlings</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the neighborhood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no gainsaying that the populace is now</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely aroused to a high pitch of excitement and</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectancy in this matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The subject of the firefly and luminescence in general</seg><seg type="columnLine">has taken a tremendous hold on the popular fancy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't you see, my boy, how the widespread publicity</seg><seg type="columnLine">has paved the way for the momentous occasion when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall present our valuable work to the world?

He pointed to the apparatus on the work-bench,</seg><seg type="columnLine">elaborate to a bewildering degree, but showing in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">labyrinth of tubing, bulbs and electrical devices a neat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of design, and a precision of construction that de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted the touch of an experienced experimenter. "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been varying the oxygen concentration in the last few</seg><seg type="columnLine">runs, and I'm beginning to get a much smaller propor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the red end of the spectrum, and a definite shift</seg><seg type="columnLine">up toward the blues.- A little further investigation along</seg><seg type="columnLine">those lines, with a few more tests on the concentration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the catalyst, and I believe the problem is solved.

Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is essential that I make my exposition complete in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you may obtain a comprehensive understanding of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my invenfion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "According to modern physical theory, light is re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded as a succession of wave pulses in the ether. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary forms of light, such as sunlight, electric light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas light, etc., are due to phenomena associated with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high temperature of the light-producing medium. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid body above the temperature of absolute zero is giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing off waves of different wave length frequency, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this emanation is known as radiant energy or radiant flux.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "As you all know, the long waves given off in largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount from objects at comparatively low temperatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause the sensation of warmth. As we raise the temper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ature, in addition to these longer heat waves, those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter and shorter wave-length are given off in sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantity to be detected. At about S25°C, the rays of</seg><seg type="columnLine">short wave-length are just visible as a faint red glow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye. As the temperature is increased, still shorter</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave-lengths become apparent, and the light progresses</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the stages of dark red, cherry red, dark yellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright yellow, white-hot and blue-white, which is attained</seg><seg type="columnLine">at temperatures above 1400°C. Our sun and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars in the universe, being at temperatures of about</seg><seg type="columnLine">5000° and higher, emit a pure white light, a mixture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all wave lengths. This means of producing light, namely</seg><seg type="columnLine">by incandescence, is so universal and so easy that it is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder mankind has adopted it. Practically every il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminairt today is patterned after the sun and stars. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat an incandescent lamp filament to the highest tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perature possible without volatilizing the filament. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not possible to reach the temperature of the sun, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">2000°C is attainable, and a considerable percentage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the electrical energy which heats the filament is radiated</seg><seg type="columnLine">as light and heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You will agree with me, gentlemen, that there is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most unfortunate and deplorable divergence between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of energy radiated as heat and the amount sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">off in the form of light. The former is fully 98% of. the</seg><seg type="columnLine">total radiation, while the latter is only about 2%. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless heat radiation could be eliminated, a two horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">power engine might run the dynamo to supply our lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">that now require 100 horse-power. Incandescence is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasteful way of producing light because it is impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to separate the heat radiation from the visible light</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "However, we know of many cases where substances</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce light at temperatures much below 525°C. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">these instances, the light emission is stimulated by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">COLD LIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">713</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">other means than heat. We speak of such bodies as</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving off luminescence or cold light. The spectrum of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminescent object lies wholly in the visible region, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no infra-red or ultra-violet. As far as radiation goes, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is all light, or 100% efficient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> IT IS needless for me to make more than a passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">reference to the various examples of luminescence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">other than the particular variety in which we are here</seg><seg type="columnLine">most interested, namely bioluminescence or the production</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cold light by living organisms, such as the firefly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is, for example, the luminescence which appears in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vacuum tube when an electric current is passed through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken of as electroluminescence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then we have the various phenomena of phosphor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escence, which, although the term has been used in a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose way to indicate all kinds of luminescence, and par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly that of phosphorous or luminous animals, has,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the physicist, a very definite meaning, namely the ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorption of radiant energy by substances which after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards give this off as light. The best known cases of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such light emitting substances are the sulphides of barium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">calcium, strontium and zinc, prepared by heating to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high temperature, as sulphides prepared in the wet way</seg><seg type="columnLine">give no light, all commonly used in the manufacture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous paint. If the material gives off light only dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the time it is radiated, but does not persist after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitation, then we speak of fluorescence. As the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">implies, chcmilmninescence is the production of light dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a chemical reaction at low temperatures. This phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenon should rather be called oxyluminescence because</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically all examples of such light production involve</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxidation reactions. The glow of phosphorus is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best known case, but other elements will also glow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark, particularly freshly cut sodium and potassium</seg><seg type="columnLine">metals. •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The spectra of luminous animals are quite similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of chemiluminescent reactions. Moreover, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen, chemiluminescence is essentially an oxylumin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escence, since oxygen is necessary for the reaction. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous animals also require oxygen for light produc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Therefore, bioluminescence and chemiluminescence</seg><seg type="columnLine">are similar phenomena, and they differ from all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other forms of luminescence which I have considered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light from the firefly is due to the oxidation of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance produced in its cells, and once the structural</seg><seg type="columnLine">formula of this photogenic substance is written, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanics of this oxidation process is revealed, then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem of cold light is solved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two experiments both performed early in the his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory of bioluminescence, are of great importance in un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstanding the nature of animal light. The eminent</seg><seg type="columnLine">English physicist, Robert Boyle, in 1667, proved that air</seg><seg type="columnLine">is necessary for the organism to give off light. He ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted the air from around a piece of phosphorescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood and the light disappeared; when he readmitted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">-air, the light returned. In 1794 the Italian scientist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spallanzani, discovered that all luminescence required</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, and he showed that he could take any light-pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing animal and dry it and the light would disappear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that if he kept this dried material and at some later</seg><seg type="columnLine">time moistened it again, the light would reappear. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact I have kept dried fireflies for ten years and observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bright light whenever they were moistened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since water and oxygen are necessary, it is evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some material produced by the cells of the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">is oxidized, and this material is called, to use a general</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">term, the pliotogen (light generator), but to use a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">specific term, it is called luciferin. In a strict sense, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should speak of luciferins, because there are as many</seg><seg type="columnLine">such materials as there are types of luminous animals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each luciferin is specific for that particular variety of</seg><seg type="columnLine">living organism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Finally we may ask the question: What happens</seg><seg type="columnLine">when luciferin is oxidized? Is it converted into carbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">dioxide and water, as are sugar and fat in our body?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Experiment has shown that no carbon dioxide is pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced from the luminescence of a firefly. This is there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore no ordinary oxidation process. Considerable re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">search on this phase of the work has revealed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxidation product is a new material which may be termed</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxy-luciferin, following a nomenclature similar to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one used for hemoglobin, the red pigment of our blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When this latter substance is shaken with air, it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes oxy-hemoglobin. If we now place the new prod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uct under an airpump and exhaust all the air, it returns</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the original hemoglobin. This process is reversible</seg><seg type="columnLine">and will go either one way or the other, depending upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amount of oxygen present. Luciferin behaves in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat similar way, although the regeneration is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">effected in so simple a manner. When a firefly flashes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it oxidizes its luciferin to oxy-luciferin. When it is rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the dark between flashes, the oxy-luciferin is re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced back to luciferin, and the firefly is ready for an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other flash. In other words, this animal may be regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a lamp which burns an 'oil' and after that 'oil' has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned it is reformed, and is ready to be reburned. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the process of oxidation and reduction simply go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back and forth according to the amount of oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is in the study of luciferin that most of the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">on cold light has been done. Chemically it is a protein</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance, highly complex in structure, and its synthesis</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been the great stumbling block in this research.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, chemists now synthesize the fats and sugars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that they are absolutely identical with the correspond-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing compounds built up organically by the living cell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, we have even succeeded in synthesizing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the simpler polypeptides, the intermediate stages in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the formation of the proteins. My own humble efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this field of chemical experimentation have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowned with good fortune and ultimate success. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieced together the structural formulas of a large num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the luciferins, and have synthesized them at will</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in large quantities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">MORE than that, gentlemen, I have even improved</seg><seg type="columnLine">on nature, if I may be pardoned for uttering so</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasphemous a statement. I have effected certain minor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though significant rearrangements, in the molecular con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">figuration of the protein, producing some brand new</seg><seg type="columnLine">luciferins that are found in none of the known luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">organisms. Several of them have proved to possess</seg><seg type="columnLine">some remarkable properties. For instance, one has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found suitable for injection into the blood stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other animals, and by an automatic oxidation in the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">capillaries at the surface of the body it gives the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">a striking luminescence. I have even gone so far as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">develop a human luciferin, with which I have produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">some startling results. Perhaps you have already heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the 'Human Firefly,' and I think you will now have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty in fathoming this apparently mysterious phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"However, my object, throughout all of this gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">714</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">research, was fixed and definite. The ultimate aim of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire work was to devise a lamp in which luciferin is</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned continuously over and over again, without the aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any life processes. In one region luciferin is oxidized</seg><seg type="columnLine">to oxy-luciferin to yield a bright, pure-white lumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nescence; in another part the oxy-luciferin is reduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to luciferin again. Such is the principle of the ideal</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp to imitate and improve upon the work of the lowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">firefly. I am happy to inform you, gentlemen, that before</seg><seg type="columnLine">you stands the very embodiment of that principle--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Hament Colite Luminor'!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout this lengthy recital the assembled audience</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid keen attention to the words of the scientist.

To the technical experts in the group</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of Dr. Hament's preliminary explanation was of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very familiar nature. To all those present the remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able significance of his own personal researches and final</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph as he described them were sufficient to engender</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeling of high respect. Yet, the general attitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">animosity could not be downed in spite of that feeling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While his chief was expounding the underlying prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciples of cold light, young Graham had been occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">in assembling on the table a curious contrivance that, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">general appearance, bore a striking resemblance to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old-fashioned parlor kerosene lamp. Standing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen inches when lit, it consisted of a round barrel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped body, supported on a metal tripod, and sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted by a large spherical globe of some creamy-white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass-like material. The body of this queer lamp had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small hinged cover located off to one side and near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top which ostensibly could be opened up to reveal the</seg><seg type="columnLine">internal mechanism. A number of slender brass tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">projected out of the body at various points on its surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to bend back and re-enter the apparatus at different</seg><seg type="columnLine">places. Several adjusting knobs and buttons were lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated near the bottom, as was also a small meter-like de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vise, similar to a steam pressure gauge on a boiler. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">model was equipped with a tiny electric motor situated at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very base of the body, and encompassed by the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">supporting legs. A flexible electric cord made contact</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an outlet conveniently situated in the baseboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the table. The entire device standing there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-circle of doubting and incredulous eyes, made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather startling appearance. Certainly it was like noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that any of those present had ever seen before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The president of the International opened with the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun in the fiery barrage of doubt and aspersion. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have so carefully outlined to us, my dear professor,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Joyce, insinuatingly, "may be very true--all of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but even before you turn on this pretty magic lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">toy of yours, how do we know that there is nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked about it? Now I see you're going to employ</seg><seg type="columnLine">the electric current for running your lamp. Isn't that</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly the underlying basis of modern illumination and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasn't it been since the day when Thomas A.

A curt question regarding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minor point was sprung by one individual,, and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Hament could make satisfactory reply, the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke in the form of a wave of quibbling and hair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">splitting queries and comments that left the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed and shaken. He leaned back limply against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">table, surveying the group about him with much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same feeling, perhaps, as a lamb regarding the circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hungry wolves that is closing in about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And besides," blurted out Cobbett, the research chief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you are not telling us anything new. Our experimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">staffs have made an exhaustive investigation into the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire problem of the firefly's luminescence. Working in</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolute secrecy, of course, we have developed a score of</seg><seg type="columnLine">luciferins and determined their chemical and physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">properties. More than that, we have anticipated your al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leged discovery of a method for oxidizing the photogenic</seg><seg type="columnLine">material outside of the living organism. In fact, our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">special lamp for effecting this continuous and reversible</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation is already being constructed and will soon be</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstrated publicly. Therefore, Dr. Hament, with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">due regard for your wonderful discoveries, I am afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you are a little too late. Still, we shall be pleased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you show us how your device operates. It surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">can do no harm for us to witness a demonstration."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE inventor had now regained his former com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posure and equanimity. A smile of mingled pity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scorn flitted across his lined features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen," he said simply, "I must confess that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never anticipated this hostile attitude on the part of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">so-called democratic and enlightened group, such as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">profess to be. My invention is my own and I take mod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est pride in knowing that I am the first and only living</seg><seg type="columnLine">man today who has successfully duplicated biolumin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escence on a practical scale, notwithstanding your ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">travagant claims to priority. I realize all too well the</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense upheaval in the realm of illumination all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world if my principle of cold light were to be adopted</seg><seg type="columnLine">universally. The motive for your insolent antagonism is</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore rather too obvious. I reasoned, nevertheless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my invention could best be exploited and put at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposal of mankind by a great organization like your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own, controlling as it does the entire field of incandescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumination all over the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "However," he added with a significant shrug of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, turning to his assistant, "I fear we have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken, Walter.

This committee will sit as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jury to determine the worth of the device. If I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear from you in the course of the next twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours I shall assume that you are not interested, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall commence to take steps toward the proper devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opment of my lamp.

According to reliable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  information, this scientist, a certain Dr. Arthur Hament,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  with the aid only of a youthful assistant, and working</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  diligently and unobtrusively for years, has perfected a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "cold light" lamp, whose efficiency of energy conversion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  and illumination is very nearly 100 per cent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Specific details as to the mechanism of this new lamp</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   are lacking, and at the local offices of the Corporation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   there is a strange air of mystery and reticence. None</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   of the higher officials are willing to answer questions, in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   sisting that important announcements will be forthcoming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   shortly. It is generally conceded by many noted men of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   science who have been questioned on the subject that,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   should the final facts bear out the current rumors and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   reports, then the illumination industry is due for a revo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   lutionary upheaval even more phenomenal than that pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   duced by the advent of the incandescent electric light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      It is the belief of many who are in close touch with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   the matter that this obscure inventor, Hament, might be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   able to throw some significant light upon the mystifying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Human Firefly" occurrences that so thoroughly terror-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   ized certain parts of the state several months ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  News items similar to the above were featured in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">press all over the country. Reporters scurried about</seg><seg type="columnLine">energetically, trying to rustle up some reliable informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on the revolutionary invention. They pored over</seg><seg type="columnLine">every scientific directory and every "Who's Who in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Science" extant, but found nothing that would even hint</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at the identity or domicile of the mysterious Dr. Arthur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hament. The every-day individual read the reports</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly, and discussed the subject of cold light enthusi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">astically, with everyone he happened to meet. The topic</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a household by-word throughout the length of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. In the space of a few days the contagious approba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion had spread over the entire civilized world. Regard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the matter as already an established fact humanity, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one voice, sent up a united chorus of acclaim for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable invention, and its still more remarkable in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor. The offices of the International in all the prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipal capitals of the world were besieged by rabid in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quirers, all hungry for some meager scrap of information,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some inkling as to the nature of the new and wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of illumination. All such queries were met with</seg><seg type="columnLine">polite but firm statements that everything would be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed in due time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">******</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO this very day Dr. Hament cannot explain how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious burglary was accomplished. With both</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham and himself asleep on the lower floor of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottage, the nocturnal intruders must have worked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">feline stealthiness to force a kitchen window in the rear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass through into their bedroom, then beyond into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hallway and up the creaking stairway to the laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the second floor. The only explanation that appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all feasible was that the slumbering pair were drugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their sleep, and that the marauders were then able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work with great leisure and thoroughness. This theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to be borne out by the slight feeling of nausea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dizziness with which they struggled into wakefulness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the faint sweetish odor that pervaded their room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whatever means the intruders had employed to effect an</seg><seg type="columnLine">entry into the laboratory above, their plundering was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly accomplished with a mathematical and meticulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to details. Nothing appeared to have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlooked. A large quantity of assorted types of luci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferin, carefully bottled and labeled, were taken, as was</seg><seg type="columnLine">also a considerable amount of rare chemicals that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed in the synthesis of these photogenic substances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In addition, a complete model of the "Colite Luminor"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was removed, together with two others that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly dismantled. The burglars did not overlook a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half dozen notebooks containing plans and specifications</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the new lamp, as well as a vast collection of mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matical and chemical data, formulas and equations, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perimental directions and notes, together with observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions and measurements of a highly intricate nature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Curiously enough, a large amount of platinum, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisting of foil, crucibles and wire was not molested, like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise a sizable quantity of gold and silver. It was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident that the thieves knew just what they wanted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted no time in getting it. In its thoroughgoing com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleteness, the job was one that would gladden the heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a veteran second-story man. Dr. Hament made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful inventory of the losses, checked and rechecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the items missing, and then smiled in a very knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner to Graham. The burglary was not reported to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police, and to all outward appearances nothing of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling nature had occurred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">******</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE opening night of the stupendous International Il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumination Exposition was heralded by a veritable</seg><seg type="columnLine">blaze of glory. The colossal Exposition Hall in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York was a galaxy of color and dazzling brilliance. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">716</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lighting device used in modern days was on exhibition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Myriads of lamps, of all shapes and sizes, and made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand varied uses, illuminated the interior of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast hall with a blinding intensity that rivaled the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">in splendor. One complete wing of the exposition palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">was given over to an exhibition depicting the progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the science and art of illumination from the earliest</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginnings of fire in recorded history, down to the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brilliant incandescent lamps of the latest design.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everywhere there blinked advertising displays and devices</seg><seg type="columnLine">that demonstrated the highest type of resourcefulness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventive genius. Suspended from the huge dome-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling hung a number of tremendous lighting fixtures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of almost blinding incandescence. They shed a penetra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting blue-white illumination over the entire exhibition</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor below, and completed the grand picture of one mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificent blaze of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THOUSANDS poured through all the entrances at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment of opening, eager to bathe in the incan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent brilliance, and to inspect and marvel at the latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">advances in the field of illumination. But much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious was each spectator to witness the long-heralded</seg><seg type="columnLine">"cold light" demonstration. Every notice, every news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper advertisement, every printed word describing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthcoming Exposition had promised some startling</seg><seg type="columnLine">revelations in connection with the new invention. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">"cold light" exhibition of great import was scheduled for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening night, and certain news of a highly sensa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional character was to be divulged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was much hunting and inquiring for the loca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the exhibit of major attraction, but to the hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of questions fired at the guides and attendants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hall there was one single, monotonous reply: "Wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see." It was apparent that the exposition officials</seg><seg type="columnLine">were planning to spring the event in the nature of a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the very height of the hubbub and shuffling of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless hundreds'of visitors parading from booth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">booth in slow streams, there suddenly burst forth, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">from nowhere, a deep stentorian voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ladies and gentlemen!-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The electric public address system was booming forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">a message and the assembled multitude ceased their</seg><seg type="columnLine">meandering and conversing to crane their necks upward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A diminutive balcony circled the great enclosure, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railing stood a man, talking into a microphone. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of him a small wooden platform extended out be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the railing, supported by a bracket from below. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer device rested on it, a contrivance that in general</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance bore a striking resemblance to a parlor kero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sene lamp. Supported on a metal tripod, it consisted of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a barrel-shaped body surmounted by a large spherical</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe of some creamy-white, glass-like material. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire apparatus stood about eighteen inches high. Ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently nobody among that entire mass of surging</seg><seg type="columnLine">humanity had taken the pains to look up and observe</seg><seg type="columnLine">this queer device, until the moment when the attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the multitude was drawn to the balcony by the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">words from the amplifying horns. Nor had anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">until this instant taken notice of a small painted placard</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging right below the wooden platform, and bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the simple legend:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAMENT'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOAX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vast assemblage became silent and motionless,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and thousands of eager and expectant eyes focused aloft</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the single figure at the microphone, and the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious contrivance in front of him.

In our</seg><seg type="columnLine">negotiations with the inventor, we of the International</seg><seg type="columnLine">were equally anxious to see a really practical solution of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this great problem. The very foundation of our organi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zation has always been the fostering and developing of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that tend to better the illumination art. We must</seg><seg type="columnLine">now confess a profound disillusionment. Our technical</seg><seg type="columnLine">staffs have made a thorough and exhaustive investiga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion into the device submitted by this inventor, Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hament.

Therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my dear friends assembled here tonight, we take this op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity of affirming our steadfast convictions that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">science and art of lighting, as exemplified in the thous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ands of exhibits all about you here have reached their</seg><seg type="columnLine">acme of perfection.

One by one the huge globes</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended from the ceiling were dimmed and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged into darkness. On all sides lights went out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flashing advertising signs ceased their luminous cavort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and were extinguished. Mercury-vapor lamps, glar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ultra-violet generators and tiny flashlight bulbs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned off as if by magic, and slowly the vast hall was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrouded in darkness, a darkness that appeared infinitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">more profound by contrast with the previous blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumination. Only the distant exit-lights pierced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom with feeble rays of red light, and served to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fantastic, almost supernatural aspect about the scene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hushed crowds waited in awed anticipation, yet not</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing what to expect.

Suddenly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysterical shriek pierced the gloom from the far corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hall. A woman clutched her neighbor's arm con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsively and pointed aloft with horror in her eyes.

At last it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly behind the tiny platform and in clear view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horrified thousands below. A luminous hand, knarled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thin, waved the astonished announcer away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the microphone, and the beaming and kindly countenance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dr. Hament faced the awed multitude below. Panting</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the exertion, the old scientist, for the space of sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral minutes, could no more than just stand there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching the railing with his glowing fingers and survey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the dim sea of heads below. Nobody stirred. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrilling aspect of a brightly luminous face, high up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny balcony, punctuating the vast ocean of gloom</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a brilliant luminescence, was sufficient to strike</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boundless amazement, if not terror into the hearts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spectators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My friends!" came the kindly voice of the luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and the reverberating words from the amplifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns broke the magic spell that appeared to have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast over the entire assemblage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My friends, you will pardon me, I hope, for thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling you by my strange appearance, just as I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will pardon my previous bizarre visitations among</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in this unconventional manner. Yes, my good peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple, the 'Human Firefly' stands before you, as does also</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inventor of the 'Hament Colite Luminor.' In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the scathing accusations and insulting references</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which you have just listened, it is no more than fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I present myself here and offer a defence.

I suspected it from the start, and now my</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicions are completely confirmed. This device, stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing here now before your very eyes, has been proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">an apparent failure. It doesn't work, and I feel safe in</seg><seg type="columnLine">stating that it never will work--not in a thousand years</seg><seg type="columnLine">--at least in the form in which it now exists. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">talented scientists, these skilful investigators in the lab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oratories of the corporation have, if we are to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">their spokesman, performed some sensational feats of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical synthesis. They have forced nature to reveal</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret of the firefly and the chemical character of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luciferin. But in their boundless zeal they have over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked a point--one single detail--that might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered with ease by a high school student of chem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istry and physiology.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me give you an elementary idea regarding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of this missing point. A large number of chemi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal reactions are not brought about, or at most proceed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with infinite slowness, unless a certain substance is pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent to help the reaction along. These chemical ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terials that assist in effecting processes, without them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves being in any manner changed, are known as cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lytic agents, or catalysts. You have in your body dozens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such substances, that go by the name of enzymes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose function is to assist the various chemical changes</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on in your system. For example, when you chew</seg><seg type="columnLine">bread, a special catalyst in your saliva mixes with it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly converts the starch into glucose sugar.

However, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing more than luciferin, oxygen and water are neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary, and this is what the enlightened scientists of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">International Illumination Corporation have apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlooked. The luminous organism manufactures also</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tiny bit of another substance, which is of vital necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the production of luminescence. It is the catalyst for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this chemical reaction, and its name is luciferase. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not consumed in the process, but in some mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner, it brings about the oxidation reaction. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">it the oxidation of luciferin takes place so slowly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no production of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The skilful burglars, hired by the company to raid</seg><seg type="columnLine">my workshop, managed to obtain everything of value in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the duplication of my work, with the sole exception of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luciferase. My notes on the preparation of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical compound, together with some samples that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stored with these notes, were unfortunately--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall I say fortunately--overlooked.

And on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basis of these half-baked results, they shout to the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my invention is a hoax, that I am nothing but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewd publicity seeker, and that the entire problem of</seg><seg type="columnLine">commercial 'cold light' is an impossibility and a fraud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "My friends, I came to this hall prepared to turn this</seg><seg type="columnLine">little 'negative demonstration' into one that is undeniably</seg><seg type="columnLine">'positive.'

With trembling fingers the old inventor emptied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contents of the tube into the opening. He fumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dark recesses under the device, adjusting a switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, operating a control there. A low whining sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued from the innermost anatomy of the lamp, a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling the starting of a miniature vacuum cleaner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The result was amazing as it was sudden. The dull glass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like globe that perched on top of the queer mechanism be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to glow with a pale greenish phosphorescence. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brief second or two did this glow last. Then like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash the globe burst into a blaze of such magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliance as to produce a momentary blindness in all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The huge exposition hall, shrouded in a thick, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponderable darkness just a moment ago, was now flooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a penetrating deluge of light reaching into the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motest corner of the building. Dr. Hament, aware though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was of what to expect, could not help but shrink back</seg><seg type="columnLine">a step' or two, and shield his eyes. In the dazzling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The ]</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">light his previously luminescent features were now paled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sickliest kind of glow.

Below, the huge multitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">was electrified by the dazzling demonstration. Eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinked and faces turned away from the direct glare of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Luminor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The effect was truly remarkable, almost supernatural.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There stood a lamp, ridiculously toy-like in appearance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared to the mammoth globes, now darkened, hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the ceiling. And yet this puny contrivance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was throwing off a light so powerful that the most dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant nook and corner of the exposition floor was bathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a brilliance rivaling the noonday sun. By comparison,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the previous incandescent blaze of thousands of lighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">devices was as feeble as the rays from a candle flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   For the space of a few tense moments the great throng</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood petrified by the sheer magnitude of the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacle. Then, as though by the breaking of a magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">charm, the assemblage was galvanized into sound and</seg><seg type="columnLine">action. A wild cheer burst forth, a mighty yell that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed to the roof and reverberated like a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Niagaras suddenly released. Bedlam broke loose over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge exposition floor. Arms waved wildly like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">field of wheat in a windstorm. Waves of humanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed and surged below, as those in the more distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners attempted to get closer. A fever heat of excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment suffused the entire multitude, and above all there</seg><seg type="columnLine">clashed and echoed the throaty cheers of appreciating</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands. So spontaneous and soul-stirring a demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stration had never been witnessed even in the memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the oldest spectator present. There was no iota of</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt regarding the verdict of the public as to the aged</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist's marvelous invention. Dr. Hament, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome by the magnificent demonstration of the crowd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled weakly and waved a sign of appreciation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratitude. As one final convincing gesture, he placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">both hands on the dazzling globe, and brought his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">down so that his cheek rubbed caressingly on the glassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface. Then, he held forth his hands to the people be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low and his smiling lips formed the single inarticulate</seg><seg type="columnLine">word: "Cold!"

The car was surrounded by a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushes to rub against the metal tube, so as to make the joint airtight and avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waste of air. Such a tube was actually put into Broadway for"the space of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a block near the City Hall Square and was also exhibited at the Fairs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the American Institute which was much patronized in those days of early and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more simple and less sophisticated New York. It is quite possible that such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube as is described by our author might be sufficiently improved, some time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the future to be of practical value.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                    Illustrated by WESSO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IF my friend the engineer had not told me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tube was dangerous, I would not have bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ticket on that fatal night, and the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never have learned the story of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Golden Cavern and the City of the Dead.

Naturally I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of the many wild tales and rumors that have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been circulated ever since the accident, but I must ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">my readers to bear with me while I attempt to briefly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketch, not only the tremendous difficulties to be over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come by the engineers, but also the wind-propulsion</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory which was made use of in this undertaking; be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it is only by understanding something of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two phases of the Tube's engineering problems that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">can understand the accident and its subsequent revela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It will be recalled by those who have not allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their view of modern history to become too hazy, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the close of the twentieth century saw a dream of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineering world at last realized--the completion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-heralded undersea railroad. It will also be recalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the engineers in charge of this stupendous under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking were greatly encouraged by the signal success</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the first tube under the English Channel, joining</seg><seg type="columnLine">England and France by rail. However, it was from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">second tube across the Channel and the tube connecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montreal to New York, as well as the one connecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York to Chicago, that they obtained some of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">then radical ideas concerning the use of wind power for</seg><seg type="columnLine">propulsion. Therefore, before the Undersea Tube had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been completed, the engineers in charge had decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make use of the new method in the world's longest tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel, and upon that decision work was immediately com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced upon the blue-prints for the great air pumps that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to rise at the two ends--Liverpool and New York.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, I will touch upon the theory of wind-propul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion later and after the manner in which it was explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It will be recalled that after great ceremonies, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tube was begun simultaneously at the two terminating</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities and proceeded through solid rock--low enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the ocean floor to overcome the terrible pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the body of water over it, and yet close enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea to overcome the intensity of subterranean heat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Needless to say, it was an extremely hazardous under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking, despite the very careful surveys that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made, for the little parties of workmen could never tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they would strike a crack or an unexpected crevice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would let down upon them with a terrible rush, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of the Atlantic. But hazard is adventure, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the two little groups of laborers dug toward each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, the eyes of the press followed them with more</seg><seg type="columnLine">persistent interest than it has ever followed the daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">toil of any man or group of men, either before or since.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">720</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they found the jewele'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">casket, through whose glass top</seg><seg type="columnLine">they peered curiously down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white body of a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONCE the world was startled by the "extree-e--" an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncing that the English group had broken into</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extinct volcano, whose upper end had apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">been sealed ages before, for it contained not water but</seg><seg type="columnLine">air--curiously close and choking perhaps, but at least it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not the watery deluge of death. And then came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great discovery. No one who lived through that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">will forget the thrill that quickened the pulse of man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind when the American group digging through a seam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of old lava under what scientists call the "ancient ridge,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke into a sealed cavern which gleamed in the probing</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashlights of the workers like the scintillating points of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand diamonds. But when they found the jeweled</seg><seg type="columnLine">casket, through whose glass top they peered curiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon the white body of a beautiful woman, partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">draped in the ripples of her heavy, red hair, the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped and wondered. As every school child knows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the casket was opened by curious scientists, who flocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the tube from the length of the world, but at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first exposure to the air, the strange liquid that had pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tected the body vanished, leaving in the casket not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'hite figure, but only a crumbling mass of grey dust.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the questions that the finding of the cave had raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained unanswered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Who was this woman? How did she get into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealed cavern? If she had been the court favorite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mythical kingdom, now sunk beneath the waves, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been disposed of in court intrigue, why would her</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderers have buried her in such a casket? How had</seg><seg type="columnLine">she been killed ? An unknown poison ? Perhaps she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a favorite slave of the monarch.

Therefore this woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been a captive. Geologists, analyzing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lava, announced that it had hardened in air and not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, while anthropologists classed the skull of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman as essentially more modern than either the Nean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derthal or Cro-Magnon types. But the engineers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretly fuming at the delay, finally managed to fill up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave and press on with their drills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then following the arguments that still flourished in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the press, came a tiny little news article and the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">message to carry concern to the hearts of the engineers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sea had begun to trickle in through one slight crack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps it was only because the crevice was located on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the English side of the now famous "ancient ridge" that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the article brought forth any notice at all.

The long Tube had been dug.

I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sooner taken off my coat than the door was opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an old fellow with a mass of silver hair peered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg your pardon, sir, but I understand you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged this car alone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I can get no other accommodations tonight.

I decided he was a musician. Only artists</seg><seg type="columnLine">go in for such lovely hair. But he undressed in dignified</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, not casting so much as another glance in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, while on my part I also forgot his presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, looking through the port-hole, I realized that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train had begun to move. Soon the drone of the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelling engines began to make itself heard. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the train began to dip down and the steel sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance became too high for me to see over. My friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the silver hair had already turned off the light, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now I knew by the darkness that we had entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tube. For some time I lay awake thinking of "Dutch"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ultimate failure of his life's dream, as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlined it to me, and then I sank into a deep, dream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was awakened by a terrible shock that hurled me up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the side of the compartment. A dull, red glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured through the port-hole, lighting up the interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a weird, bloody reflection. I crept painfully up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the port-hole and looked out. The strangest sight that</seg><seg type="columnLine">man has ever looked upon, met my eyes. The side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall had blown out into a gigantic cavern, and with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the cars had rolled down the bluff a tangled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted mass of steel. My car had almost passed by,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now it still stuck in the tube, even though the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">port-hole through which I peered seemed to be sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended in air. But it was not the wrecked cars from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which rose such wails of despair and agony that held</seg><seg type="columnLine">my attention, but the cavern itself. For it was not really</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cave, but a vast underground city whose wide, marblf</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets stretched away to an inferno of flame and lava.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the terrible light was lit up the great white palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its gold-tipped scrolls, and closer to me, the golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE UNDERSEA TUBE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">725</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">temple of the Sun, with its tiers of lustrous yellow stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">--stairs worn by the feet of many generations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the stairs towered the great statue of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">on horseback. He was dressed in a sort of tunic, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his uplifted arm he carried a scroll as if for the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read. His face was turned toward me, and I mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veled even in that wild moment that the unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">sculptor could have caught such an expression of appeal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can see the high intellectual brow as if it were before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me at this moment--the level, sympathetic eyes and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN something moving caught my eyes, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">swear I saw a child--a living child coming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the burning city--running madly, breathlessly from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave of glowing lava that threatened to engulf him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any moment. In spite of all the ridicule that has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">showered upon me, I still declare that the child did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from the wreckage and that he wore a tunic similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the one of the statue and not the torn bit of a night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gown or sheet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was some distance from me, but I could plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">see his expression of wild distraction as he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb those gleaming stairs. Strangely lustrous in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird light, was that worn stairway of gold--gold, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient metal of the Sun. With the slowness of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to faint he dragged himself up, while his breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be torn from his throat in agonizing gasps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind him, the glowing liquid splashed against the steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the yellow metal of the Sun began to drip into its</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiery cauldron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The child reached the leg of the horse and clung there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> . . Then suddenly the whole scene began to shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if I had been looking at a mirage, while just behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">my car I had a flashing glimpse in that lurid light of an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">emerald-green deluge bursting in like a dark sky of</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid water, and in that split-second before a crushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow upon my back, even through that tangle of bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, knocked me into unconsciousness, I seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear again the hopeless note in the voice of my friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-an earthquake fault."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After what seemed to me aeons of strange, buzzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">noises and peculiar lights, I at last made out the objects</seg><seg type="columnLine">around me as those of a hospital. Men with serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces were watching me. I have since been told that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">babbled incoherently about "saving the little fellow" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other equally incomprehensible murmurings. From them</seg><seg type="columnLine">I learned that the train the other way was washed out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tangled mass of wreckage just like my car, both ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minus stations wrecked utterly, and no one found alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">except myself. So, although I am to be a hopeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">cripple, yet I am not sorry that the skill and untiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience of the great English surgeon, Dr. Thompson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to nurse back the feeble spark of my life</seg><seg type="columnLine">through all those weeks that I hung on the borderland;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for if he had not, the world never would have known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it is, I wonder over the events of that night as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had not been an experience at all--but a wild, weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream. Even the gentleman with the mass of silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair is a mystery, for he was never identified, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my mind's recesses I can still hear his cultured voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking about the extra berth, and mentioning his press-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mission to Paris. And somehow, he gives the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of strangeness to the events of that fatal night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in my mind, he becomes a part of it no less than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">child on the stairs, the burning inferno that lit the back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, and the great statue of that unknown hero who</seg><seg type="columnLine">held out his scroll for a moment in that lurid light, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a symbol from the sunken City of the Dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The End.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What Do You Know?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T&gt; EADERS of Amazing Stories have frequently commented upon the fact that there is more actual knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be gained through reading its pages than from many a textbook.

He observed, also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the tasks performed on his premises were under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of overseers, each responsible for ten families.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When gathered, perishable products were immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">distributed throughout the kingdom, so Quizta told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist. Cereals and dried meats, dried fruits, wool and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other time-resisting provisions were placed in common</seg><seg type="columnLine">storehouses, to be parceled out later to every household</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a per capita basis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many of the women were engaged in the spinning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread and the weaving and dyeing of cloth. The very</seg><seg type="columnLine">finest fabrics, Bell learned, were for the Inca and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">household; those a shade less fine, for the Inca and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Curaca nobles; and the coarser cloths were destined for</seg><seg type="columnLine">general use or storage, according to the need.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everywhere there were evidences of patient, unre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitting toil.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">methodical mind of the scientist soon grasped the struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of the Inca language, and he added daily to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vocabulary. When a fortnight had passed he was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to converse on every-day topics with the amauta in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own tongue; and he delighted in testing himself further</seg><seg type="columnLine">by talking with his overseers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the first three days of each week, in compliance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Inca's command, he attended the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing audiences. Sometimes he had an opportunity for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a greeting or a friendly word with Nona Flores, en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countering her by chance in the environs of the palace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After each of these occasions a hope, only half compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hended, stirred within him. But his duties were so ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting that he did not choose to seek more of her com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panionship, resting content to await a more convenient</seg><seg type="columnLine">season.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aside from the fact that they afforded him an oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to improve his comprehension of the spoken word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the audiences of the Inca were a bore to him. The elab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orate deference shown the sovereign by his subjects, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pompous ritual and the strange images, soon grew all</seg><seg type="columnLine">too familiar and ceased to hold his interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the third day of his third week of citizenship in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Cuzco, the audience in the throne room had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly tiresome, and Bell was glad when the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppliant presented himself before the Inca. He glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him curiously to see whether signs of ennui were</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent on the faces of any of the stoical Indians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When his eyes rested on Tupac, the Villac Vmu, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised to see that the High Priest, usually stolid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullen, seemed highly excited, fidgeting about on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">massive throne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tupac was striking in appearance. His skin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly darker than that of the Inca, and his wrinkled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawk-like features were rendered ferocious, almost hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eous, by two feathers protruding from the cartilage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nose and by two massive golden discs stretching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pierced ear-lobes almost to his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His closely cropped hair, its jet black streaked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray where it showed beneath his priestly headgear, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed him well past middle age; while his gaudy robes,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of a pattern worn only by the Villac Vmu, adorned a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall, spare figure that gave the impression of tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">latent energy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shadow which would end all audiences for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day was rapidly creeping toward the throne, and Bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">surmised, as he saw the High Priest bite his lips in ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">asperation, that Tupac himself desired an audience with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who was only one degree higher in the realm</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Finally, the last case was disposed of, and there still</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained a few inches of sunlight above the burnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden plate. The Villac Vmu hastily removed his san-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dals and, taking a light burden on his back, descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his own throne, walked to a position in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inca and awaited the monarch's pleasure with bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. Bell forgot his boredom; for it seemed to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this servile custom, when extended to include the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty Villac Vmu, possessed entertainment qualities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a high order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What boon does the noble Tupac desire this morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing?" asked Huayna Capac.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only to crave Your Majesty to remember his gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erous promise made a year and a half ago," humbly</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered the High Priest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean regarding the new gold service for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple? It is being wrought by the royal goldsmiths,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and will be completed in time for the feast of Raymi."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was not of the golden vessels I wished to speak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I am well aware of the explicit orders Your Majesty</seg><seg type="columnLine">has given concerning these. The subject of my petition</seg><seg type="columnLine">is of much less importance to the state, but one which</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerns me vitally as an individual. Your Majesty</seg><seg type="columnLine">will recall having promised me the hand of the beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nona Flores in marriage, and as the marriage day is</seg><seg type="columnLine">but three weeks off, I venture this personal reminder in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order that the matter may not be overlooked as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">last year."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bell half rose to his feet, urged by his seething indigna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to give Tupac the lie, but restrained by the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that surely he had not heard aright. The Inca, mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while, had begun to answer the Villac Vmu; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist, first scanning the nearest faces to see whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">any had marked his hasty action, sank back in his chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">to await the outcome with such patience as he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">command.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The hand of Nona?" inquired the calm, unhurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice to which Bell had grown accustomed. "Ah, yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we well remember the promise, and the word of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inca once given is never broken. Even so, we have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuine occasion to regret our former attitude of sanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. It seems that the radiant one is repelled by the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of marriage, and it is contrary to our desire that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">assume the bonds of wedlock against her will. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">many beautiful maidens, Tupac. Would not another do</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your Majesty, there is no maiden in the realm who</seg><seg type="columnLine">can fill her place for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Underneath his assumed humility, a note of impatience</seg><seg type="columnLine">was discernible in the High Priest's voice. The Inca's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tranquillity, however, remained unaffected.	**~</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, come, Tupac," he said. "You may have sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral of our fairest maidens--a dozen if you wish--only</seg><seg type="columnLine">release us from this rashly made promise. Surely, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much loveliness will more than compensate you for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss of this frail girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A flush mounted to the temples of the Villac Vmu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECRET KINGDOM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">729</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and he but ill concealed the angry gleam in his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His voice quivered slightly as he replied:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your Majesty's most humble servant shrinks from</seg><seg type="columnLine">causing the slightest displeasure. In spite of that fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can only reply that a dozen--nay, a countless multitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">--of the most beautiful maidens in the world could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt me if their price were the loss of Nona Flores."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the Inca was offended, he gave no sign by word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture or expression. Bell, horrified at this sordid</seg><seg type="columnLine">bargain driven by the High Priest, waited breathlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Huayna Capac's response. It was placid and meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured as before:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well, Tupac.

It seemed, however, that Bell could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not concentrate on what Quizta was saying. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unable to banish from his mind the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nona's impending tragic marriage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The amauta, after having patiently repeated a phrase</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the tenth time, finally said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is my lord indisposed today, that he does not hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words of Quizta?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To tell the truth, good teacher," answered Bell in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the language he had been so assiduously studying, "I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not feel perfectly sound. Suppose you conduct me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lady that heals, to the end that I may have the source</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my ailment disclosed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, my lord, far be it from me to displease your lord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, but you have asked of me that which I dare not do."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Genuine fear manifested itself in voice and gesture. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can, however, conduct you to the High Priest, who is also</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great healer--although some say"--he glanced about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see whether any of the household servants were within</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing--"that his power is not half so great as that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nona Flores."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not of a mind to change practitioners at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time," replied the scientist. "She nursed me through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long sickness, and I owe her my very life. If she healed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me before, why then should it be forbidden that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">heal me again? Talk reasonably, Quizta."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You speak truth, my lord, and fortunate it is for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your lordship that the lady that heals has found a cure</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the terrible curari.

"Perhaps you will be good enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell me what this has to do with the matter at hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Has she lost her power to effect cures because of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming marriage?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Villac Vmu has issued orders that no one may</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek a healing from her without permission from him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.

Again he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, continuing in a lowered voice: "The High Priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a violent dislike to your lordship when you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">first brought into the palace, unconscious. He not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">requested the Inca to have you put to death, on the plea</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you might escape and disclose the secret kingdom</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world, but when this was refused, he even bribed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a servant to poison your drinking water. In some way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lady that heals got wind of the plot, and frustrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">it by causing every servant who brought water to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">room to partake of it and remain for fifteen minutes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the man who brought the poisoned water refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drink, she called the guard, and the servitor was exe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuted soon afterward at the Inca's order."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell betrayed no excitement at this startling news.

He declared vehemently</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would not be a party to any such rash under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking, and attempted to dissuade the scientist from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not ask you to accompany me," Bell said, in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply to his protestations. "Only tell me how to find her</seg><seg type="columnLine">suite in the palace. I will attend to the rest alone. Come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend, it is but little that I ask of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quizta at first demurred, but after much urging, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the exacting of a promise that if detected Bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never reveal the source of his information, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">yielded finally and gave minute instructions for find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Nona's quarters in the great palace of the Inca.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell slipped his automatic under his mantle, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this and his Curaca's sword as his sole weapons, set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the palace. As all members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobility were permitted entrance to that edifice at will,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had no trouble in slipping into the hallway on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amauta had told him Nona's suite was located. Find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the exact door, however, was more of a problem; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">at length, after a careful count based on Quizta's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structions, he lightly rapped on the one which,, accord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to his calculations, was Nona's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A listless voice from within said, "Come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened the door and, stepping quietly within,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed it after him. Lying face downward on her couch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a perfect picture of dejection, was the girl he sought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Puzzled by the fact that she did not change her position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked to her side and gently laid his hand on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She turned and recognized him with a start of surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, Senor Bell, it is you.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled lovers saw that he wore the trappings of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant of the High Priest. Observing Bell, he halted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of the floor, puzzlement plainly written on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nona was the first to regain composure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is this ?" she asked scornfully. "Does the noble</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tupac consider me already his wife, that his servants</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the liberty of entering my rooms without knocking?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What have you to say for yourself ? Shall I report you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Inca ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O lady, I rapped on the door," answered the slave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I swear by the face of the blessed Moon Mother I</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapped, and hearing no answer I concluded you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, but tried the latch to make sure. It easily gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and before I realized it I was in the room."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What brings you here? You have a message from</seg><seg type="columnLine">your master, I presume."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My noble lord sends you this"--handing her a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">diamond necklace of great beauty--"with the request that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you wear it as his love token on the marriage day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the messenger was speaking, Bell edged care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully around toward the door. He had observed a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of malicious cunning in the eyes of the native at sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man in the room, contrary to the orders of his master,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that man making love to the High Priest's future</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wife. Turning to depart, the slave found Bell barring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be not so impetuous, O vassal of Tupac," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist in the Inca tongue. "Now that your mission is</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished, pray do not leave thus unceremoniously."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly, and without a hint of warning, the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped out a wicked looking knife and sprang at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist. The onslaught was so quick and violent that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no time to draw a weapon. Bell was obliged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to resort to strictly defensive measures. A second later</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were rolling over and over on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The American was strong, but this native was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful man he had ever encountered. At the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap he had secured a hold on the scientist's windpipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the latter, still convalescent from his recent illness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself unable to break, especially since he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliged to occupy one hand in holding the threatening</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife away from his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The throttling grip was taking its toll. Struggle as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would, Bell knew that his senses were rapidly leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Tiny lights danced before his eyes. His strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">ebbed. The slave felt the weakening fingers relaxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hold on his wrist, and with a savage cry of exulta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion wrenched his knife hand free. He was about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge the blade into the heart of his intended victim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his triumphant shout ended in a gurgling gasp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he pitched forward on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell, who had closed his eyes, mutely awaiting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">death blow, now looked up in bewilderment after feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body of the other slump down beside him. He met</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nona's anxious eyes; then saw the bloody poniard</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched in her right hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," she said hurriedly, "let me help you to get up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You must leave at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell rose to his feet with considerable difficulty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have saved my life . . . again," he whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How can I ever repay you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By leaving this place. You are still in danger."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But what about you ?" he asked, pointing to the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. "I will wrap it in a blanket and take it with me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, no. That would never do. You would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped before you had gone fifty feet. Leave it to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have a plan. I will simply tell them that this man at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked me and I killed him. No one can deny my story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is no witness, no circumstantial evidence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned away shudderingly from the messenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom she had silenced forever, and dropped the reddened</seg><seg type="columnLine">dagger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now it is good-by," she said haltingly, "for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I shall never be allowed to behold you again."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seeing the tears that glistened on her silken lashes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bell caught her in his arms. The fire and vigor of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong body returned to him as he held her close.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nona," he said, "you are not going to marry Tupac.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Be assured of that, once and for all. I will try to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">a way to hide you on the national marriage day. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail in that, the High Priest shall die before he calls</seg><seg type="columnLine">you wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since we are not permitted to see each other, we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrange a meeting place now.

Bell rose early, having slept but poorly if at all;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he knew that before nine o'clock that night he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a way to save Nona from the clutches of Tupac.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was spurred on by the consideration that, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the week just passed he had devised plan after</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan, he had eventually been compelled to reject each</seg><seg type="columnLine">one as futile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he passed through the house it seemed deserted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he reached the dining hall, where a single servitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are all my people ?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They departed long since for the temple of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord Sun," the man replied.	$</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they have prepared no food," said Bell, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the need of bolstering up his strength for the exertions</seg><seg type="columnLine">which might await him. "Are they entirely unmindful</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their master ?"	$</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be not angry with them, my lord," answered the man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is a long established custom and a law of the land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that every person, bond or free, is to forsake his usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupation on the great feast days. His Majesty will</seg><seg type="columnLine">provide ample food for all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noting the fellow's suppressed eagerness, and guessing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was anxious to be away, Bell commended him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his loyalty in remaining after the others had gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bade him be off and enjoy himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell decided that he would occupy the time until day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light in seeking out some breakfast. The larder was</seg><seg type="columnLine">amply stocked, and he had about completed a satisfactory</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal when there came a knock at the door. He went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">open it, and found that a servant in the livery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">royal palace stood without. He bade him enter, and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired his business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My lord," said the servant, making obeisance, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear the greeting of His Majesty, the Inca, and the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand that your lordship present yourself with the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of the Curacas at the appointed time, to take part in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ceremonies of initiation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell was alarmed, for he feared the upsetting of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nona's plans. However, he calmly bowed his assent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At what hour will the young Curacas present them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves before His Majesty?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Immediately after the noble young Incas have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">received, my lord, which will be not long after the rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great Lord Sun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greatly relieved, Bell decided to accompany the mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger on his return to the city. When they arrived they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the streets thronged with the eager populace, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the day was only beginning to dawn. The servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">went his way to the palace and Bell attached himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a group of nobles of his own class, catching something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the holiday enthusiasm of those about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A rosy glow appeared in the east, and a hush fell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expectant throng. All that could find standing room</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already crowded about the entrance to the temple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every eye was turned toward the High Priest. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready, keen stone knife in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as the great red orb appeared, he plunged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrificial blade into the heart of a black llama; then held</seg><seg type="columnLine">its dimming eyes toward the sun until the last convulsive</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement was over. Dropping the body of the victim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he extended his hands toward the sun and prayed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice that reached to the very outskirts of the listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd. After this he set about quickly flaying the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cutting up its flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He handed the pieces to his attendants, who still</seg><seg type="columnLine">further divided them with stone knives and distributed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fragments among the multitude. The raw, warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">morsels were eaten by the favored recipients on the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This done, the Villac Vmu washed his hands, donned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a richly ornamented robe and led a chanting procession</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the east, the throbbing cadence of voices and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">measured tramp of feet accompanied by the shrill notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of double reed instruments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BELL did not join the followers of this procession, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">stationed himself near the palace gates. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that the High Priest and his train had halted, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barbaric chanting and piping continued. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inca himself, seated on a gleaming golden throne upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform borne by two dozen slaves, took his position</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the head of the column amid the acclaim of the people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and once more they moved toward the rising sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What further ceremonies ensued Bell could not see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor did he greatly care. Not wishing to attract attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself, he stepped into a side street to await the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn of the people, and when they came back ere long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingled with them and once more made his way towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gates of the palace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young Incas of the royal household appeared a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little later. Having reached the proper age, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished their fastings and tests of skill and strength,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now awaited public recognition of their attainment</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rights and privileges of manhood. The monarch</seg><seg type="columnLine">came forth and addressed them briefly, after which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to his retinue:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall do that which remains to acknowledge them</seg><seg type="columnLine">men before us all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He then pierced the ears of each candidate with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden bodkin and invested him with a beautifully</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought scarf, a pair of cloth slippers and a garland of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers. Attendants conducted them to an inner cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber for further ceremonies in charge of Inca nobles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young Curacas, who had endured the prescribed</seg><seg type="columnLine">trials successfully, were next inducted by means of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremony decreed for those of their station. The Inca</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanned the group until he saw Bell, whose stature and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair hair distinguished him from his companions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Noble Curaca," he said. "You have proven to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">royal satisfaction that you are possessed of both cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age and skill, through your defense of our own person</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the dangers of the forest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A murmur of approval ran through the listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">throng.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking a salver of sacred bread from an attendant, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sovereign was about to advance for the purpose of divid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a portion with the new white Curaca in accordance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the hoary custom of the Incas, when Tupac, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">High Priest, broke the silence of the breathless multitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your Majesty, I protest against this violation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient laws and customs of our nation.

However, we do not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve our erstwhile defender would be averse to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial. What say you, noble Curaca ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell smiled and shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It matters not to me, Your Majesty," he answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Tupac interposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If Your Majesty will permit a further suggestion,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "may I propose that the white Curaca be per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted to try conclusions at wrestling with one of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">athletes ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the Inca surveyed Bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "While our noble white Curaca appears to be no weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling, it is not the custom of his native country, as it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ours, for all to learn the art which every man among</seg><seg type="columnLine">us has practiced since childhood. It is possible that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the circumstances, he may choose to vindicate his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to the title of Curaca in some other manner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His questioning eyes had held those of Bell for but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment when the latter, to the surprise of all, replied:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The arrangement suggested by the noble Tupac is</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite satisfactory to me, Your Majesty. Though I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrestle but indifferently among the athletes of my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, I am not entirely without experience in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sport, as Your Majesty has so graciously intimated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">may at least be able to afford some entertainment to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Spoken like a man," said the Inca, who, unaware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bell had been the wrestling champion of his university,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared that he might make a sorry showing against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poorest of his athletes. "And now to choose an opponent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I appoint-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE was looking at a stripling--a comparative novice</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, he thought, might be a reasonably even</seg><seg type="columnLine">match for the scientist--with the obvious intention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">selecting him, when Tupac again interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it please Your Majesty," he said, "I propose that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white Curaca meet Ripac. They are quite evenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">matched in size, and should show us a worth-while bout."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a look of guile in the eyes of the High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priest, which did not escape the notice of Bell, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">burly individual, fully half a head taller than the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and with thews so mighty that the muscles of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist, powerful though they were, appeared almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">childlike beside them, shouldered through the crowd amid</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries of approval from some and of protest from others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell noticed that the words of sanction came mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the members of the crowd who wore the livery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the High Priest. Others shouted, "For shame! It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no match. Ripac would break him like a dry reed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not fair to pit our champion against one of lesser</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and experience."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These latter being in the majority, the sagacious Inca</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted that the crowd was with him and held up his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">for silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would indeed be unfair to pit a man of lesser ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience against the mighty Ripac," he said. "I there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore appoint Corac," indicating the stripling, "who will</seg><seg type="columnLine">oppose the white Curaca."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were looks of dissent from many of the High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priest's followers, and Tupac himself ill concealed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chagrin, though he dared not openly oppose the edict of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Inca. The multitude in general, however, did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem greatly moved, either to favor or to disfavor, by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">announcement; but an abrupt change was apparent in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude of all the spectators when Bell surprised them</seg><seg type="columnLine">by addressing the Inca thus:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is most thoughtful of Your Majesty thus to accord</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the opportunity of meeting one of your lesser cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pions. However, if it please Your Majesty, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">prefer the more exacting test proposed by the noble</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tupac."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A thunderous shout of approval shattered the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tense silence which followed his words, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time before even the Inca could make himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you aware, noble Curaca," he asked, "that Ripac</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the mightiest wrestler in New Cuzco--that he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily overcome the ablest contenders for his title?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Some hint of his prowess has just now been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed to me through the attitude of the people. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">Majesty," replied Bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And this does not deter you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Your Majesty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A murmur of applause from the now tense auditors</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well. You shall meet Ripac."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man whom the Inca had named stepped forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look of disdain on his brutal countenance. Bell noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the features of Tupac lighted up for a moment with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expression of triumph, before he could compose them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mask-like calm that marked his usual demeanor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         _ Six Fiancees</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AS soon as the Inca announced that he should meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ripac, champion wrestler of New Cuzco, Bell laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside his mantle. A ring was cleared on the turf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">around which the gaping natives pressed as closely as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could. Praise of Ripac was heard from many, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts commending the bravery--the sheer audacity--of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white man came from every side. There were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectures, too, some of which were audible to the scientist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to how quickly the Inca champion would subdue his</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller opponent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pair stood facing each other, waiting for the royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">command to proceed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you ready, noble Curacas?" inquired the calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of the Inca.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ready, Your Majesty," both replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then proceed, and may the great Lord Sun look with</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor on the better man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spectators strained forward, watching for the rib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracking hug which they knew to be Ripac's favorite hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with which they had seen him maim many an oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent. Then they gasped with amazement as they saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man easily elude the outstretched hands; saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">move with cat-like quickness and seize their undefeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although it was a hold well known among wrestlers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer world, it was new to the secret kingdom. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same motion with which he bent and eluded those</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful, gorilla-like arms, Bell had applied the tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECRET KINGDOM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">733</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dous leverage of the crotch and half-Nelson. Ripac was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung aloft as easily as if he had been an infant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eager onlookers gasped again, thinking their</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion would be hurled to the earth with bone-break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing force, but breathed with greater ease when Bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped him to the ground without great violence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of following up the advantage which might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have given him an easy victory, Bell drew back and al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed the astounded Indian to arise. The crowd surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in about the pair to watch the outcome, and Ripac, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest heaving with suppressed rage, extended his brawny</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and charged with a bull-like bellow, apparently de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined that this time the elusive white man should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell did not avoid the outstretched hands. Instead he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized one sinewy forearm and turning, brought it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder. A quick heave and Ripac, describing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">none-too-graceful arc, alighted on his back with a thud</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a grunt some distance from his fresh and still smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">adversary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more Bell allowed him to regain his feet, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this instance assumed the role of aggressor. Leaping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Ripac could even try for a hold, he seized a thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist and simultaneously tripped the giant with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scissors-like movement of his legs, throwing him prone</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground. The astounded spectators then saw Bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend the thick wrist back and up, seize the other as Ripac</seg><seg type="columnLine">groped in a clumsy effort to break the hold, and force</seg><seg type="columnLine">both huge hands along the spine toward the bulging neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With clenched teeth and brutal features contorted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pain of that muscle-straining hold, Ripac endeavored</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shake off his opponent. The more he struggled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher Bell pushed his enormous paws, until blood from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bitten lips mingling with the foam that issued from</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his clenched teeth, he groaned:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly releasing the twisted arms, Bell, to the ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">companiment of deafening applause, assisted his weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened opponent to arise. When the shouting had subsided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Inca, turning to Tupac, asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is there need for further testing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Compelled to admit that there was none, Tupac mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered what grace he could, while the Inca, amid further</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts of approval from the multitude, broke sacred</seg><seg type="columnLine">bread with the white Curaca before conferring this mark</seg><seg type="columnLine">of favor and acceptance on the other candidates. Ripac,</seg><seg type="columnLine">less versed in guile than the High Priest, brushed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people aside and departed, glowering and muttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">threats against his conqueror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scientist was becoming more impatient with each</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing minute.

He had certainly won the approval</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the populace, but at the same time he had no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a powerful Curaca his enemy. He looked to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inca for a sign that the ceremonies were at an end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Noble Incas and Curacas," said the sovereign, "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people will be faint with hunger, if food be not soon pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided.

The Inca</seg><seg type="columnLine">was borne to a place at the head of the line, the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripping branches from the trees and clearing a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">path down the center of the street. As the monarch and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his train approached, they strewed branches and flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the way, at the same time intoning a subdued</seg><seg type="columnLine">chant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell observed that several figures were seated on mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive thrones atop a great platform, next in line after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huayna Capac.

Following these came a long line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of slaves carrying trays, baskets and jars of food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink, and a great quantity of golden utensils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Someone placed a hand on his arm, and he turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find Quizta beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My lord is amazed," said the amauta, "and Quizta has</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought him out in order that he may not be found want-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as an instructor.

Arriving at the end of the vineyard, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly brought up against a single row of grapes which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been planted straight across and at right angles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning, he walked aimlessly along the trellised and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly-vined end-row, still deeply preoccupied; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out abruptly to grasp a woody stem for support.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pulled himself to a sliding stop, realizing that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">errant feet had nearly carried him over the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">736</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He peered cautiously down, and saw that the rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls rose sheer and smooth. A small stream a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet below him gave back the rays of the sun, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked a herd of llamas as they approached the water's</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge to drink. They looked no larger than flies, so great</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned back from the cliff and noticed that the odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">row of vines extended parallel with it, approaching at</seg><seg type="columnLine">places within three feet of the edge. He was proceeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">along this narrow pathway when his attention was at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted by an eagle, soaring toward a point in the cliff a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little lower than where he was standing. The bird of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey carried a small animal in its talons. Bell looked be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low for a landing place, but could see none. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a shelf or crevice visible for more than a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet--in fact, the surface was in some places actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">concave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Watching the eagle curiously, he was amazed when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently flew directly into the solid wall at a point</seg><seg type="columnLine">about thirty feet below him and disappeared from view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He waited patiently until the feathered scourge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air launched forth, and flew away with empty talons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a reason for his loitering now. The signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cance of this happening had smitten him suddenly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcibly. There must be a cave or hole of some sort in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rock--an aperture which, judging by the unhesitating</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner in which the eagle had approached, would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">large enough to admit a man. At least, it would bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked back to his villa, and, finding the place still</seg><seg type="columnLine">void of inhabitants, entered to seek out his camping</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment. He removed a light, tough coil of plaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">fibre from one of the boxes, laid aside his outer gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and wrapped the entire rope about his waist. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had again put on and fastened his cloak, no one would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have guessed that he carried anything unusual concealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his person.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For caution's sake, he strolled casually back through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vineyard. When he was again behind the vines on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff's edge, however, his leisurely manner disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared. Quickly uncoiling the rope from about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist, he made one end fast at the base of a thick grape</seg><seg type="columnLine">vine and went down hand over hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having descended what he thought to be about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper distance, he sought a footing upon the smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the precipice, and shortly was rewarded by feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his toes catch on a firm ledge. At this promise of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">payment for his efforts, he lowered himself more slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meanwhile working his body inward with a walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he felt a sharp blow on his shin, quickly fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by a half-dozen more. The mother bird had evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently returned during his absence, and was protecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">her home. Bell, stubbornly determined to complete his</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation, kicked out viciously, slipped, experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">an uneasy moment of precarious balance and then found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself sprawled on the floor of a small cave. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly discern two moving objects in the murky interior,</seg><seg type="columnLine">presumably the eagle and one of her offspring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His leg smarted from the onslaught of the angry bird's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp beak, yet he did not want to kill her, unless it should</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove absolutely necessary. He edged a little farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cave, but the eagle took this for an offensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement and flew at him with a scream of rage, talons</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended to strike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell avoided the attack by throwing himself quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one side, and the furious defender's momentum carried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her outside and a full fifty feet beyond the opening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rushing to where the eaglet cowered in a corner, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">usurper seized it and threw it from the cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On looking out, he saw what he had anticipated would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take place. The mother bird swooped down beneath her</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling, fluttering progeny. Catching the helpless thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">deftly on her back, she flew swiftly away and was soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mere speck on the horizon. Familiar as he was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ways of these creatures, the scientist was certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would not seek to reclaim her lofty domicile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to examine the chamber. It was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve feet deep and perhaps ten wide. The floor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strewn with bones and covered with filth. The half-eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains of a freshly-killed agouti, a rodent about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of a rabbit, lay near him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell cleaned house, as best he could, by scraping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">litter from the floor with his sword and pushing it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway. Then he climbed back up the rope, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">some distance along the edge of the cliff and returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a huge bundle of dried grass. He pulled up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope and attached the bundle to the end, eased it down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and descended once more to the cave. Drawing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass in after him, he released it and shook it down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one corner of the room. When he had repeated these</seg><seg type="columnLine">labors several times, a soft and comfortable couch was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His next concern was for provisions. The sounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">revelry reached him faintly from the city, and he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one approaching along the road. Still, there was need</seg><seg type="columnLine">for extreme watchfulness. He would run no risk of hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his precious secret discovered. Accordingly, he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">several trips to the storeroom and back, carrying small</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantities of food under his clothing, and watching care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully for returning servants. Though none appeared, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the further precaution of pulling up the rope and</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealing it each time he left the cliff. Consequently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was late in the afternoon when he completed his task</seg><seg type="columnLine">by depositing two large skins of fresh water in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That evening, as Nona prepared to meet Bell in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden, her heart was filled with anxious forebodings. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accompaniment of terrifying thoughts, she donned</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing suitable for rough travel, as Bell had suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What if we are discovered ?" she asked herself. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Tupac's men should see us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She knew all too well what the awful consequences</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be. Bell would be taken and executed, and she--</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt they would keep her in close confinement until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morrow. There would be no escape for her from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate she most abhorred--the seraglio of the High Priest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she stole quietly out through the door of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment, her courage almost forsook her. She hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated for only a moment, however, nerving herself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk slowly along the hallway and down the steps leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the garden. As she made her way toward the meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, two figures detached themselves from the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the palace wall and stealthily followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Arriving at the statue of the llama, she waited breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly.

What could have delayed him ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortunately, the great torchlight procession had drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the populace to the other end of the city. They ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make good their escape at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each minute seemed like an hour. A thousand appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensions tortured her.

She rushed forward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a glad little cry of welcome--then stopped with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an exclamation of terror. The man was Tupac.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Instinctively she shrank back against the base of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the statue.

He rushed breathlessly through the unpeopled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">streets until at length, with his objective before him,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he paused in dismay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The trysting place was as deserted as the empty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">streets through which he had just passed. A great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fear gripped his heart--all the more terrible because he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had no idea where to turn or what to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The sound of a gruff voice, followed by a woman's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scream in the shrubbery at his right, suddenly ar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rested his attention. He would know those voices</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">anywhere--the guttural tones of Tupac and the ter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rified cry of Nona Flores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Parting the thickly grown bushes, he saw by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dim light two forms struggling in a small clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He crossed the intervening space in a single bound,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and flung his arm beneath the chin of the taller figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bereft of breath by the encircling arm, Tupac</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attempted nevertheless to draw his sword; but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a hard fist, driven with tremendous force,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crashed against his jaw again and again.

"Let us be</seg><seg type="columnLine">off at once. We have no time to lose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though she still felt dizzy and faint, Nona managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scan their surroundings with watchful eyes. Thus it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that she detected a movement amongst the bordering</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick!" she cried. "There is someone behind you 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her warning came none too soon, for as Bell turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men sprang at him from opposite directions. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down in an instant with a swift uppercut to the jaw;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the other, who was far more wary, was not to be sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dued so easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He circled lightly about the big American, looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opportunity to strike with his long, keen-edged knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bell, wishing to end the contest quickly, drew h*s Curaca's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword and hurled it with all his might. The savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodged aside, so that the weapon shot past his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed into the bushes. This swift evasion inflicted its</seg><seg type="columnLine">penalty, however; for he tripped on a projecting root and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell headlong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately there was a fierce struggle on the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outcome of which was dubious; for while the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was the stronger and heavier of the two, the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exceedingly cunning and agile. They rolled over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, grunting, snarling, clutching, clawing. If one gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the advantage, he promptly lost it again through some</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick movement of his adversary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scientist found it exasperatingly difficult in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">half darkness to get an effective hold on his sweating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slippery opponent. The fellow had an uncanny way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eluding him. In addition, he retained his dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife, which must needs be guarded against.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile, the man who had taken Bell's uppercut was</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovering consciousness. The sounds of the melee may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have hastened his return to normal. Soon he stole towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two on the ground. Once within striking distance he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent over them, dagger in hand, awaiting an opportunity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nona, perceiving the new danger which threatened her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lover, secured the sword of the High Priest and crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">up behind the crouching aborigine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The opening he sought presented itself to the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">man when Bell, with a powerful heave, flung the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his back and grasped the sinewy throat. The battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have ended then and there, but just as the savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was preparing to plunge his blade into the back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American he heard the snapping of a twig behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wheeling swiftly, he faced Nona. There was derision</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his throaty cry as he reached for her, not perceiving</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was armed. She lunged blindly with the sword;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then stepped back just in time to avoid the falling body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly reaching Bell's side, she found him cursing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plunging the Indian's knife agaifi and again into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifeless form. For the moment, a primitive rage had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely unbalanced him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laid her hand on his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," she whispered. "We must go. He can harm</seg><seg type="columnLine">us no more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the touch of her hand the madness left him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gory knife dropped from his trembling fingers and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose unsteadily, his breath coming in quick gasps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went to where the other Indian lay and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on his face, stone dead. The blade of Tupac's sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">projected from his back, having been driven in to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilt by his fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell now turned his attention to the High Priest. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoundrel showed signs of coming to, so the American</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bound and gagged him securely with strips torn from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own garments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They left the garden warily, and were soon treading</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thoroughfares of the city. Street lights were un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known in New Cuzco, and the friendly darkness en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped them. However, the ruddy glow far behind grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily brighter, and they knew that the torch-bearers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were returning to the great square. Here, Nona in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed her companion, they would quickly disband and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take their several ways to their homes, for this was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the great feast of Copac Raymi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The situation still demanded the utmost stealth, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though haste was equally imperative. Onward they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went, through streets and lanes, past small houses set</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely together, by the more pretentious homes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobles, through a succession of gardens, orchards and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vineyards, until finally they stood at the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff. After a twenty-minute search in the darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bell found the spot for which he was seeking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After he had uncoiled the rope from about his waist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the American secured one end to the thick grape vine he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had used previously and stood waiting for an inspiration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nona's whispered words of gratitude and relief had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased some time before with their agreement to maintain</seg><seg type="columnLine">as nearly complete silence as possible. Now Bell's prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem was to get her into the cave. She could not shin</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the rope as he had done, and he dared not risk</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying her down for fear that it might break with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He finally hit upon the scheme which appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only feasible one. A short conference was necessary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the attendant hazard. They decided that he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">tie the rope under her arms and let her down slowly un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til she could get her feet into the cave opening and thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain access by the method which Bell had employed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon. This plan was put into execution, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung her carefully over the brink and gradually low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered his precious burden, with a prayer that the rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">might hold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon he felt the strain lessening, and a moment later</seg><seg type="columnLine">she called to him softly that she was safely in the cave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He then threw the rest of his slack over the cliff, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment later was with her in the cavern, untying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard knots, which had held her in the descent. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging his mantle over the entrance and lighting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">candle, he showed her where the provisions were, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they sat down on the humble couch he had constructed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you afraid to stay here by yourself, Nona?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I feel safer here than I ever felt in the palace of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inca," she replied. "No, I am sure I shall not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened, but it will be terribly lonesome."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Indeed it will," he agreed. "I wish I might come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit you, but I suppose that will be impossible. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt I shall be suspected and spied upon. There are</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and water here for two weeks, but if all goes well</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will take you back to the palace in two days. Much will</seg><seg type="columnLine">depend upon the attitude of the Inca. If I am con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demned, I shall have time to inform them of your where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abouts, so there is no danger of your starving here. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">marriage day will have passed for another year, and many</seg><seg type="columnLine">things can happen in a year. Perhaps-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked up quickly and read the longing in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, perhaps . . . but we cannot talk of it now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right. I must get to my room without arous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my servants, in order to establish a perfect alibi to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow.

I shudder to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think what my tardiness in meeting you might have cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but that is all over now. Nona, while I hate to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">you cooped up in this dismal hole, I can at least be happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the knowledge that tomorrow you will not be Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tupac."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, that makes any hardship easy to bear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a few pensive moments, she looked up at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">archly but with the suggestion of a shadow in her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you considered, Seiior Bell, that before another</seg><seg type="columnLine">day passes you will become the husband of six native</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauties? I cannot say that I relish the thought."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have devised a way out of that situation, too," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered. "Tomorrow I will put my plan into execu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It may work, but I'm afraid it won't. I am terribly</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whatever happens contrary to my wishes, you shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no cause for jealousy," replied the scientist, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortified his promise with a lingering kiss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When their farewells had been said, he extinguished</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light, donned his mantle and in another minute was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiling the rope about his waist at the top of the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything seemed quiet and orderly within the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he arrived. Removing his sandals, he stole noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly to his bedchamber. His first act on reaching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was to remove his torn, blood-stained clothing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn it in the fireplace. After a refreshing bath, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched his tired body on the bed and fell into troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, for many weighty problems still confronted him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The National Marriage Day</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE white Curaca's valet awakened him somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier than usual by tapping on the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," he said drowsily, and turned over to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy a few minutes' sleep while his bath was being pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man bustled about with unwonted noise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">alacrity, and the nap was of short duration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Emerging from the bathroom, Bell noticed that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant had brought him clothing of particularly brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">hues and gaudy pattern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did you get that bird-of-paradise outfit?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "Take it back and bring me a regulation Curaca</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If your lordship will permit," replied the valet, bow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing humbly, "I venture to remind you that this is your</seg><seg type="columnLine">marriage day. These are the customary wedding garments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a Curaca noble. It would be most improper to appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the Inca for the ceremony in any other costume."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell felt like blurting out that he was not going to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear before the Inca at all, that day, but he refrained</seg><seg type="columnLine">and suffered the man to fasten the resplendent apparel</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After breakfast he strolled out into his yard. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed a specimen of the tree, Qtiillaja Saponaria, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">soap-bark tree, growing there the day before and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his intention to put it to a somewhat novel and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cidedly spectacular use. The bark has been used for</seg><seg type="columnLine">various purposes in pharmacy. Cutting off a portion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bark, he went back to his room where, after bolting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, he rummaged among his camp belongings until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found a stew pan. This he partly filled with water</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tap in the bathroom. He then kindled a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire in the grate, cut the bark into minute pieces, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed these to the water and put the concoction on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to boil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon the liquid turned a pale brown color, upon which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he removed the pan and allowed it to cool. This being</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished, he shook it and smiled as a light foam ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared on the surface. He had made a fairly good sam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple of Brazilian vegetable soap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He filled his mouth with a portion of it, disposed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balance, and packed the pan away once more after</seg><seg type="columnLine">rinsing and thoroughly drying it. Then he walked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hallway and, on meeting a slave girl, moaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">loudly, blew a quantity of froth from his mouth and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor, struggling and twisting as if in great agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She gave one frightened look at him, then dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedding she was carrying and rushed down the hallway</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help! Quick .. . our master is dying. He has fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a fit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her cries brought a score of servants, and Bell was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon surrounded by an excited group of men and women.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He rolled his eyes, turned his head from side to side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then emitted small puffs of foam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The amauta!" cried someone. "Get the amauta."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just at this juncture the worthy Quizta, the amauta, ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived on the scene. Believing the American to be in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">death throes, he ordered them to convey him to his room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell writhed and frothed at the mouth until his supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">of liquid soap was exhausted, after which he lay as still</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The amauta drove the curious servants from the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed the door. There was a look of anxiety on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face as he approached the bedside. Bell saw that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a true friend in Quizta. Just now, however, he gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">dully up at him* apparently with unseeing eyes. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke haltingly, simulating great weakness and pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you . . . send ... a message for me, Quizta ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gladly, my lord. What manner of message may I</seg><seg type="columnLine">send ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please dispatch one of my slaves ... to the Inca, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the message . . . that I regret exceedingly . . . that an ill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, which prevents me leaving my bed-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused, seeming to labor for breath. The sympa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thetic amauta bent lower over his pupil and waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to continue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have the messenger .. . tell His Majesty that.. . this</seg><seg type="columnLine">illness makes it impossible . . . for me to attend . . . the</seg><seg type="columnLine">national marriage day festivities."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It shall be done at once, my lord."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So saying, Quizta pulled a bell cord and issued the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary instructions to the servant who answered. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">then took a seat at the bedside. Bell tried to go to sleep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but finding this out of the question, simply closed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and wished that the sad-faced amauta would leave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This the latter failed to do, however, and time dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearily for the scientist, who hardly dared lift a finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fear of betraying the fact that he was not a grievously</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick man. After a tiresome hour of this, Bell had about</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to ask his friend to leave when a sudden commo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was heard in the yard outside. Quizta rose and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the Inca!" he cried. "The Inca is coming."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell now felt that it would be up to him to act in real</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest. He had not expected any such development as</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. A few moments later the Inca was seated at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">740</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We were extremely sorry to hear of your illness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">noble Curaca," he said, "but since you could not come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, we have come to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am overwhelmed by Your Majesty's kindness," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied the American in a low voice, feigning to be almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">too faint to talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This marriage day has been rather puzzling to us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">First the Villac Vmu and his fiancee failed to put in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance. Then we received your message. All of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other marriage ceremonies have been performed and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">festivities are now in progress. Your own absence was</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfactorily explained, but that of Tupac and his bride-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-be remains a mystery. Neither has been seen since</seg><seg type="columnLine">last evening, nor can a trace be found of either of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell was secretly elated. So, they had not found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">High Priest. That meant that he had not succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberating himself. Of course he had trussed his enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">up quite well, but with never a thought that the bonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hold so long. The picture of the pompous arch</seg><seg type="columnLine">villain spending the national marriage day in the quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">seclusion of the Inca's shrubbery was so pleasing to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he restrained himself with great difficulty from</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckling aloud. He managed, however, to give the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of mild surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What can have become of them ?" he asked haltingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Is it possible . . . that they have left . . . the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">together ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is impossible for anyone to leave this mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">without our knowledge and permission. They are hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere nearby, but we shall not trouble ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them. If they do not wish to be married, why, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is nothing to us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The monarch clapped his hands and a number of people</seg><seg type="columnLine">trooped into the room, among them the six maidens to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom Bell had been betrothed some days before. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter came to the bedside at a sign from the Inca, where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon he grasped the scientist's limp fingers and, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand of each girl in turn, joined them in the attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">of friendly greeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell assumed that they were holding a ceremony of</seg><seg type="columnLine">condolence for him and hoped it would soon be over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Formalities of any kind bored him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Inca arose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must be weary from all this excitement, so we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will leave you now with our hearty congratulations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">good wishes for your speedy recovery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So saying he left the room, followed by his courtiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and attendants. The six maidens, however, remained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he heard the last of the royal party leaving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, Bell called the amauta to his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are they waiting for ?" he asked, indicating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">six young women who stood demurely before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They await your pleasure, my lord. You will no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt wish to assign them quarters. Shall I attend to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter for you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Assign them quarters? What do you mean, Quizta?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Have they no homes? I am not running a boarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">school for young ladies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His mind has been weakened by the sickness," thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amauta.

"Why, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you talking about, Quizta? There has been no</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremony."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The marriage ceremony of our people is very sim-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ple," replied the amauta. "It consists merely in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">joining of the hands of the contracting parties on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">national marriage day by the Inca or his district gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernors."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell dropped back on the pillows. So, all of his acting</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been for naught.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have them conducted to suitable quarters, Quizta,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he murmured weakly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the following morning, Bell was looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his camping equipment when he chanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a knife of curious design and pattern. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had belonged to Tumba, the man who had been his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion on the wearisome journey through the Brazilian</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness. He had been so busy with other matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">since his advent in New Cuzco that he had completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten his fafthful servant, and felt not a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashamed of his negligence as he balanced the small, keen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged weapon in his palm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Truly, a sharp reminder in more ways than one," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected, and resolved to make inquiries regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tumba at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To this end, he enlisted the services of Quizta. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amauta had heard nothing concerning his lordship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant. If a Carib, or resembling a Carib, he had prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably been made a slave. In New Cuzco all Caribs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves. He would investigate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some hours later a messenger returned with the tid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings that Tumba was a slave in the service of one Caxa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marka, an Inca noble of considerable wealth and influence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bell, taking a quantity of gold from one of his treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">chests, asked Quizta to conduct him to the home of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caxamarka.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they were ushered into the presence of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">noble, they found him with his quipucamayu or keeper of</seg><seg type="columnLine">records, busily engaged in going through a huge pile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the documents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Figuring up his resources, no doubt," thought Bell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"From the size of that stack of yarn, I judge he must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in excellent financial circumstances."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Caxamarka was gray-haired and seventy, but athletic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and youthful of figure. Age rested but lightly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He greeted his visitors cordially and desired to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know in what manner he might be of service to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell explained that, through some mistake on the part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Inca's men, his servant had been made a slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with the Caribs. Having heard that the noble Cax-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amarka was now the owner of Tumba, he had come with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wish to purchase him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, the old nobleman remembered having received</seg><seg type="columnLine">four slaves from the Inca's soldiers a short time before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would have them brought in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A servant was dispatched. He returned some mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments later with four sullen Indians. Tumba was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them. The scientist's disappointment showed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Caxamarka was sorry--exceedingly sorry. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tumba had been purchased by some other noble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quizta suggested that they question the Caribs. Pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly they would know what had become of their former</seg><seg type="columnLine">adversary. Bell interrogated them in their own tongue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one of the men replied that Tumba had been bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the day before by Morea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECRET KINGDOM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">741</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is Morea?" asked Bell. "We must find him</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Morea is my daughter," replied Caxamarka.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She recently came of age and has a fortune in her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. I knew that she had acquired some slaves yester-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, but it never occurred to me that your man might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been among them. I will have you conducted to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They found the lady reclining listlessly upon a dainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">couch, regaling herself with tiny cups of cocoa which a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave girl handed her from time to time. Meanwhile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she listened with a somewhat bored expression to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">singsong voice of a patient amauta as he read from an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Spanish novel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morea longed for romance--she sought romance; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow it had always eluded her. Being the daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the third man of the kingdom, she hardly dared con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider any of the lesser nobles as a possible husband;</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequently she had set her cap for the High Priest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While he had many concubines, not one of them had in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred sufficient favor to be elevated above her com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions as ruler of Tupac's seraglio and potential mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his lawful heirs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the place which Morea had for some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveted and, incidentally, the distinction which the Villac</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vmu had intended to confer upon Nona. When his</seg><seg type="columnLine">intentions in this matter had been made known to Caxa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marka's daughter, the tidings had caused her considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger and mortification, and she had then and there re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved to marry a man for love and to throw ambition</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the winds. Up to the present time, however, love had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not come to her. So far she was merely in love with love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she saw Bell, all this was changed. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about him which fascinated her--attracted her</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely. She knew not what it was, and cared less.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had triumphed at last. She had glimpsed romance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she meant to see more of it. Could it be, after all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was mistaken? But no--all of the delightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensations described by her Spanish authors were there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wild beating of her heart when he had entered, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicious thrill when he had touched her hand in greet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, her magnetic response to the very sound of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice: all these convinced her that a most delightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair of the heart had sprung into full flower in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She would have preferred that the object of her af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fection should be at least an Inca noble; but Bell had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already been made a Curaca, and a man so altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid in natural endowments should carve out a much</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater place for himself amongst the New Cuzcan no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility. Perhaps before the next marriage day rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">around he would have performed some great deed on be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of the state, and would have been rewarded by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevation in rank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She graciously bade the scientist and his companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seated, dismissed her amauta and offered them choco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late. After a somewhat trivial conversation in Spanish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bell gradually led around to the reason of their visit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tumba? Oh, yes, I remember him well: the strongest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most intelligent slave among those I purchased yes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terday. He is really quite valuable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am prepared to pay any price you ask," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bell, emptying the contents of his bag of gold before</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. "Take from this pile of coins a quantity sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reimburse you fully. If this be not enough, I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring as much more as you require."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Morea scarcely glanced at the heap of glittering metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dismiss your amauta and I will send my slave girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Matters of this kind are best discussed in private."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although he was somewhat surprised, Bell complied</seg><seg type="columnLine">by requesting Quizta to leave the room and remain out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, after which he waited for the girl to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want none of your gold," she said when they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. "I have plenty of it--more than I shall ever need.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You have brought the price of fifty slaves, but should</seg><seg type="columnLine">you offer ten times that amount I would not touch a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single piece of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Am I to understand that you will not part with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tumba at any price?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did not say that. In fact, I fully intend that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall be yours, but he shall not be paid for with gold."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps, then, there is some task you wish me to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. In that case you have only to command me, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only because I long to have my old servant back, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I will consider it an honor and a pleasure to serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">so gracious and charming a lady."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morea leaned toward him with sparkling eyes, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanity touched by his gallant speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want you to take me in your arms and kiss me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white men kiss their sweethearts," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell was completely taken aback. Feeling obliged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spar for time, he resorted to what he considered pardon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able dissimulation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And how is that?" he inquired. "Never having had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sweetheart, I am very much afraid that I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualify. Indeed, I am quite sure that I should be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismal failure at acting the part of a lover."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As he aptly put it later, he was "between the devil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deep Blue sea." He wanted Tumba back and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to go to almost any lengths to get him; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of kissing this half-savage girl was revolting, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubly so when he thought of Nona.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "O, but I am sure you could do it beautifully," she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied, accompanying the words with her most winning</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. "One does not need practice for such things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to all the books I have read on the subject. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, if you don't want to you needn't," she added a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit haughtily. "I will keep the slave and you may take</seg><seg type="columnLine">your money and be off. The daughter of Caxamarka is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in the habit of seeking favors from a mere Curaca."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bell rose and bowed stiffly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I, though 'a mere Curaca,' am not in the habit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of seeking favors from anyone," he retorted. "I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to purchase a slave who rightfully belongs to me. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own statement, I tendered you the price of fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves in payment. The gold is no more to me than it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you. I will not trouble to take it with me. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish, you may keep both my money and my slave, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guilty knowledge that you are making unlawful use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the property of another."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morea was furious for a moment, but when she saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was leaving, pride capitulated to desire. Quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing to his side, she placed a restraining hand on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do not go, noble Curaca," she implored. "I spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily, thoughtlessly, and I ask your forgiveness. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall have both your money and your man. Here." She</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed him the sack, and he held it while she replaced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure. "I will retain only this small piece of Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">coinage as a keepsake. Your slave shall join you im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately in the yard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell felt elated over this unexpected turn of affairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wheeled suddenly and took her lightly by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">742</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I cannot kiss you as a man would kiss his sweetheart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That would never do. I am a married man with six</seg><seg type="columnLine">wives. I will, however, kiss you as a brother might kiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sister."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So saying, he touched her cheek lightly with his lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was gone before she could grasp the full signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cance of his words. She stood looking after him, dazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his sudden speech, thrilled by his kiss of gratitude and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering much at his strange eccentricity. Mechanic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, she summoned a servant and gave the order for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tumba's release.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later, there was a happy reunion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">master and man in front of Caxamarka's palace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were returning home when Bell noticed a familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure approaching. It was Tupac, followed by a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen of his attendants. As the two parties passed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road, the scientist saluted gravely. The High Priest's</seg><seg type="columnLine">only response was a lifting of the eyebrows. His brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">stare, however, was full of the bitterest malevolence. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was patent that he, at least, had guessed the identity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who, after effecting the rescue of Nona Flores</seg><seg type="columnLine">under cover of darkness, had left him to meditate on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">error of his ways in the Inca's shrubbery patch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Noble Curaca," said the amauta anxiously, when this</seg><seg type="columnLine">little drama had been enacted, "your humble servant is</seg><seg type="columnLine">again reminded that the mighty Villac Vmu is not kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposed toward your lordship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That seems quite evident, Quizta. He failed to recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nize my greeting save by black looks. I have fulfilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the requirements of courtesy. What more can I do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have no suggestion, except that my lord maintain</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strictest vigilance." He lowered his voice. "In New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cuzco, it is commonly held that to incur the displeasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the High Priest is to sign one's own death warrant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I have told your lordship such things as I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning his methods, you will recognize that your</seg><seg type="columnLine">peril is a very real one. The Villac Vmu not only has</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically unlimited civic power, but in addition he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols an efficient spy system which keeps the populace</seg><seg type="columnLine">in abject terror at the mere mention of his name. Among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the common people, the name of Tupac is usually pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced in a frightened whisper, with the admonition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Be careful, for even the ground has ears.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Many believe that he possesses supernatural powers</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of which he is enabled to know, at all times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that is being said and done in the kingdom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those who oppose his will meet with imprisonment, tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture or death. If his enemies are too powerful to be at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked openly, there are other ways. Only a few weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, an Inca noble was rash enough to express his dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">approval of the Villac Vmu. He died suddenly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysteriously. There was a rumor that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisoned, but the investigations which were made dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered nothing, and the matter was quickly hushed up."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Quizta, I thank you for this new evidence of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship and concern for me. I shall be on my guard."</seg><seg type="columnLine">While the amauta talked, he had been giving more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of his attention to troubled thoughts about Nona. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that, now Tupac's suspicion was apparent, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no time to lose in getting the girl back to the palace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without doubt the High Priest would strike suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretly and effectively. It would be folly to leave her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lonely cavern, when the only one in possession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her secret might be slain at any moment. He therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolved to go for Nona that very night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon his return home, Bell sat at the table for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time with his six newly acquired wives. "The Sex«</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tette from Huayna" he called them, in an effort to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with good humor a most unpleasant situation. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all daughters of Inca nobles and spoke Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluently, so there was no lack of conversation. He joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">in amiably enough, maintaining, however, a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of reserve and dignity which forbade undue</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiarity. They seemed to take his partial aloofness</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a matter of course, which at the time surprised him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although he learned afterward that this was the demeanor</seg><seg type="columnLine">generally affected by heads of households throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Cuzco.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They listened, wide-eyed and wondering, to his descrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the part of the world from which he had come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plied him with incessant questions, many of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have seemed childish to a person unacquainted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fact that they had always been so circumstanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to gain but meager knowledge of any part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell retired after dinner to what he termed his library,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there to enjoy a cigar while transcribing some notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had made that day; for, in spite of the predica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in which he found himself, he was still the scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">at heart. Even though biological investigations were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, perforce, a hobby rather than an occupation, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">manuscripts had been enriched by many pages, at odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, during his enforced residence in New Cuzco.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had written but a few lines when the "Sextette"</seg><seg type="columnLine">came quietly in. The girls distributed themselves about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room in various comfortable and home-like attitudes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each took from a beaded bag that she was carrying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some unfinished work with which to occupy herself. Bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that the one nearest him was making fillet lace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the others seemed to be embroidering sundry small</seg><seg type="columnLine">articles of apparel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not wishing to appear rude, and yet feeling a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">vexed at this calm introduction of domesticity into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">workroom, the scientist resumed his task without a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">of greeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His wives tactfully forebore from conversation in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order not to disturb him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half-hour of writing, and his notes were all tran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed and the papers put away. He turned, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes fell on Mirim, the one who was making the fillet</seg><seg type="columnLine">lace. She looked up quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will it please my lord to be entertained this evening ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell was puzzled how to answer. He had intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to his room, but realized that it would be several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours before he could venture to take Nona from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seclusion of her cave. Meanwhile there was nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do but to wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What sort of entertainment?" he inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mirim seemed surprised at his question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have been taught to sing, to play stringed instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and to dance." she replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought of Nona, passing the monotonous hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">out there in the lonely cavern. No one was entertaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Why should he make merry ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some other time," he said. "I am still a little unwell</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my stroke of yesterday, and must retire early."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As my lord wishes, replied Mirim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood watching them for a moment as they strove</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hide their disappointment in closer application to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">needlework, and a great pity for the cloistered women of</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Cuzco tugged at his heart. Then he bade them a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful good night, heard their responses and went up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs to his room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECRET KINGDOM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">743</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Prisoners o£ Tupao</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON reaching the seclusion of his chamber, Bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately sent for Tumb'a. After closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bolting the door, he told his faithful ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vant in simple terms the things which had befallen since</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arrival in the city. He was especially careful to im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press upon the Indian the power, cunning and resources</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his enemy, the High Priest. He then disclosed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention of sending his guide on a scouting expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the premises in search of lurking spies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tumba was eager to start at once, but Bell would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him go until shortly after midnight. In twenty min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes' time, he was back in the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you find any spies ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scout held up one finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, you found one, did you? Where is he?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He dead," replied Tumba in a matter-of-fact tone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">producing a sharp knife with a significant red stain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood channel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have been too hasty, boy. I did not want him</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed. I only wished to give him the slip. We must</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw the body over the cliff at once. If Tupac learns</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you have killed one of his men, we'll be in a devil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tumba led the way to the body of the slain prowler.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he stopped and laid his hand on Bell's shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoining silence. They approached warily and saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men were bending over the deceased, talking ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citedly in the Inca tongue. It appeared that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just discovered their companion and were endeavoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ascertain who had killed him. Bell heard one utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sentence in which were the words "Villac Vmu", then</seg><seg type="columnLine">start off at a trot while the other stood guard over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must act quickly," whispered Bell. "He is going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to warn the High Priest. • I guess we'll have to get rid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this fellow now. Think you can do it, Tumba?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me get urn, all right. You walk straight up to um.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Me go other way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell waited until Tumba had a start of a few minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then sauntered directly toward the spy without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to hide the sound of his approach. The man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon hearing him coming, crouched with knife in hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for deadly action. Bell advanced steadily, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">totally unaware that he was being ambushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an old ruse, but it worked well. The spy, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrating his attention on the approaching figure, neg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected to look elsewhere. The trap was sprung. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife of Tumba drank blood for the second time that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, and soon each of them was dragging a body toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brink of the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After fifteen minutes of disagreeable and strenuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor, the two dead spies were disposed of. Master and</seg><seg type="columnLine">man hastened at once to the point above the cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell leaned over the cliff and called softly. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no answer. His heart leaped to his throat. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have happened to Nona? He called again. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a surge of relief, he heard her reply</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly preparing the rope, he made it fast to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">much-used grape vine, and was soon in the cave. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">an affectionate greeting, he prepared at once for Nona's</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure, relating meanwhile the adventures of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll have to work fast, I'm afraid," he concluded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"No doubt Tupac's spy will have a young army down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us in a short time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He made the ascent in his customary manner and, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the assistance of Tumba, quickly lifted the girl to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper level. Then, coiling the rope about himself, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">formerly, he led the way toward New Cuzco, making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">detour in order to avoid possible reinforcements for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">High Priest's snoopers, of whom he supposed there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">others holding his premises in furtive surveillance. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had passed through several plantations and all dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger from attack seemed averted, he dismissed Tumba,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking that it would be better for them to reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace unattended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As they proceeded cautiously, Bell unfolded to Nona</seg><seg type="columnLine">the events which had taken place since he had hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">her in the cave. She did not seem surprised when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her how he had unwittingly acquired the "Sextette"</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the very moment when he was congratulating himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on having evaded matrimony by playing sick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Of course," he hastened to add, "you know I will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize this absurd ceremony in any way, other than</seg><seg type="columnLine">by permitting the girls to live in my home. Circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances compel me to do that much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sure that you couldn't have done otherwise,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied the girl, "nor do I blame you in the least; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of your having six wives, even though they be</seg><seg type="columnLine">wives in name only, is a rather disquieting one. I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">help feeling that some of them are going to fall in love</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you, in which case I shall become terribly jealous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for they will employ all of the arts known to womankind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to win you--arts against which the strongest resolutions</seg><seg type="columnLine">may avail you nothing. The man who can resist the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiles of a clever, beautiful woman is a rarity indeed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I agree with you," he replied, "nor do I claim that</seg><seg type="columnLine">immunity; for there is one woman on this great rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet of ours who could easily twist me around her little</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger. But there have been no others, nor shall there</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever be another. I need not name this one woman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For answer, she pressed his hand in the darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We should be pretty near the edge of town by now,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Bell. "I hope we haven't come the wrong way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What the-?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Something whistled through the air and twined around</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs. The momentum of his body threw him forcibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground. Rising somewhat awkwardly, he slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sword from its sheath in time to face a half-dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, who rushed in on them from all directions. He laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him savagely with the stout blade, well knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this unequal fight could have but one end, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nona crouched on the ground beside him, almost para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyzed with fright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard the whistling noise again and something</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound about his throat. Hampered as he was by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">close-wrapped bonds that pinioned his legs, he lost his</seg><seg type="columnLine">precarious balance. The back of his head smote the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard earth with considerable force. Instantly a savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nona screamed with terror as she saw the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge his knife into the breast of the prostrate man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fellow seemed bent on out-and-out murder. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised the dagger to strike again when one of the am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushers, who seemed to be in command, caught his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and emitted a few sibilant words of admonition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment more, Bell and Nona were securely</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound. Each was placed on the back of a horse. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were conveyed, not toward the city as they supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would be, but directly away from it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">744</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell was weak and faint from the wound in his chest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which throbbed with pain at every step of the horse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had it not been for the coils of rope about his body, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife would surely have pierced his heart. The tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiber had saved his life, temporarily at least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was it that had tripped him, and later encircled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat? Ah, yes. It must have been a bolas, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar sort of lasso or rather sling, used by the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">American Indians. Instead of a running noose, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped with two leaden balls, and these natives could</seg><seg type="columnLine">use it fully as effectively as the North American cowboy</seg><seg type="columnLine">throws his lariat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had journeyed for fully half an hour when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader turned into an enclosure and stopped before a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small adobe building. There were but two rooms in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. Bell was placed in one and Nona in the other. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt their captors would send for the High Priest, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, and this time there would be no chance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape. He would probably be tortured and killed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nona. . . he shuddered at the fate in store for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strained desperately at his bonds. Finding his</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost efforts unavailing, he cursed and ground his</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth in helpless rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fed to a Boa</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SEVERAL hours after Bell and Nona had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust into their adobe prison, the scientist heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of galloping horses and guessed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tupac had arrived. Someone opened the door of Nona's</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. The agony and the fury of that moment seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give him superhuman strength. The rope which held</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms parted, and a moment later he had freed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and was listening at the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried the fastening cautiously and it yielded beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. Peering through the slender aperture, he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a group of men and horses a short distance away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A single guard stood in front of the building. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, the fellow was faced away from the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying on a shouted conversation with one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions who had charge of the horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly and silently Bell stole out. The door of Nona's</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison chamber stood wide open, and he could see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure moving about within. An instant later, he recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized the intruder as Tupac. Weaponless though he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to the precautions taken by his captors, Bell sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the throat of the High Priest, who gave vent to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">choking gasp as the white man bore him to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What have you done with the girl?" he hissed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell me quickly, or you shall never speak again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tupac rolled his eyes in terror and amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the sacred locks of Chasca, I swear I have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing with her. I have not even seen her," he babbled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You lie, damn you, but this lie shall be your last!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this, he tightened his grip on the throat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Villac Vmu, thinking despairingly: "I cannot save her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I can at least avenge her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then something struck him a crushing blow on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the head, his grip relaxed and he lost conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he recovered his senses, Bell tried to peer about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Everywhere was inky darkness. Had he gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind? He rose unsteadily and groped here and there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His hands came in contact with cold, .moist stone. Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploring with his fingers, he sensed the unmistakable touch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal, flat and with round projections at regular inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals--a studded iron door, he decided. As nearly as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could tell, the frame was about three feet wide. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehend the scope of his quarters in this fashion</seg><seg type="columnLine">required but a short time. He was in a tiny cell not</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than six feet square, unfurnished save for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">low stone bench which he had occupied. The place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">damp and musty and reeked with horrible odors. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls were slimy and seemed to ooze moisture. In view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the slowness with which his giddiness and nausea were</seg><seg type="columnLine">abating, the captive judged that he probably had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying in a stupor for hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a room situated about fifty feet above Bell's dun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geon, the High Priest was conversing amiably with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his henchmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say the boa is very savage, Ripac?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has not been fed for two weeks, my lord. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully believe he would attack even a horse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is well. Let us get the white man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ripac called two guards, and the four men descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">a winding stairway which terminated abruptly before an</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell had been listening to their approach. A moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, he heard the characteristic janglings which result</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a selection is made from a bunch of heavy keys;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the grating of a rusty lock. The door was flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, admitting just enough light to assure him that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">still had the use of his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The presence of Tupac infuriated the prisoner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was with difficulty that he restrained himself from leap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at his enemy. Guards seized him by either arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ripac led the way upstairs, while the High Priest brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the rear. When they reached the head of the stairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bell balked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are you taking me ?" he asked, "and by what</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority do you make prisoner a free subject of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inca ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will learn soon enough. Do not pull back. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">resist is useless. I can summon a hundred men in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant," and the Villac Vmu emphasized his speech by</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodding Bell with the sharp point of his sword.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They turned into a passageway, rather brightly lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hanging oil lamps fashioned of metal, and halted'</seg><seg type="columnLine">before a narrow sliding door. Ripac produced a key</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opened the barrier a trifle. The High Priest peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, then quickly drew back as something struck from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside with great violence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is growing anxious for the meal that awaits</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, Ripac.

Perhaps it would only last four or</seg><seg type="columnLine">five years and the professor would wake up and be</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious--for every little scar would be a witness against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had already gone too far now to draw back, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he determined to make sure and use all of the stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the vial.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He filled and refilled the syringe, jabbing wildly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor's arms and legs until the last drop was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON WOMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">749</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then with a sigh he sank down in the big velvet chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared dumbly at the seemingly dead body before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was he dead? Perhaps he had been from the first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His muscles were so rigid, his flesh so clammily cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">already the violet shadows of dissolution lay beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">his closed eyes. The doctor shuddered and reached for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bracer of brandy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bell jangled sharply in the silence. He staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet and passed into the hall, throwing a fearful</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance over his shoulder as he went; it was hard to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve it was not a dead man stretched out on the daven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He flung open the door and admitted the professor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attorney, Mr. Lecky, who was to accompany the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mausoleum and see it properly installed within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is everything ready?" he inquired brusquely after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold nod to Dr. Blinkman. He was a man of stern</seg><seg type="columnLine">common sense and had opposed as strongly as he dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the experiment which he frankly characterized as "a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack-brained freak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have been awaiting your arrival for almost an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour," returned the doctor smoothly as he led the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the library, "the serum has acted beautifully, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Hick's discovery is a monumental success."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Lecky gazed down at the recumbent form with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of profound disgust, yielding to pity:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you sure he is not dead ?" he asked sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Blinkman turned his head away under pretense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing the black box. He could not meet those search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing eyes. A sense of guilt overwhelmed him, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to retain his cool professional manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our distinguished friend," he replied suavely, "has</seg><seg type="columnLine">already no doubt fully explained to you the effects of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">serum upon the living body. It is suspended animation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my dear Mr. Lecky, suspended animation, that is all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He can neither hear, feel, think, taste, move nor speak;</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the present moment all the organs have suspended</seg><seg type="columnLine">their functions; he is insensible to heat or cold, hunger</seg><seg type="columnLine">or thirst. His system needs no fuel because there is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste, but he is not dead. But had we not better be</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the way? We have a long, cold ride before us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took from a chair where they had been laid in</seg><seg type="columnLine">readiness by the professor himself a long black cloak</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soft felt hat of the same somber hue. The helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist was closely enveloped in the folds of the cloak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft hat was pulled well down over his head so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rigid white face was concealed under the broad brim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the two men supported him between them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limousine so cleverly that to the waiting chauffeur his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master appeared in the dim light to be walking in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual fashion between his friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was lifted into the car and placed in an upright</seg><seg type="columnLine">position on the rear seat. The doctor and the lawyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed themselves with their backs to the driver, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limousine rolled smoothly and almost noiselessly out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stone gateway and turned northward in the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never did either of those two men forget that night</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride. The full moon was veiled with thin clouds and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light snow had fallen earlier in the evening. From its</seg><seg type="columnLine">purity the black ruts in the road stood out in bold relief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No living thing was abroad, not even a dog barked, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the houses were dark. The wayside bushes powdered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with snow rushed to meet them like sheeted ghosts in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the headlight of the car, sped by them, and vanished in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Professor Hicks had built his mausoleum of sleep on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of a hill in a grove of cedars. Thick woods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky pastures sloped steeply down from it on all sides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an abandoned cemetery at the bottom completed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">profound desolation of the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the foot of the hill the car stopped, the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">got out and carefully lifted the stiff form to the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still supporting it between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT morning the professor had summoned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chauffeur to him in the library, and had said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stewart, I am going to Europe for a year. Dr. Blink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man will reside here during my absence, and will take</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of everything. You are to take your orders from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but look to Mr. Lecky for your wages. Bring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car round to the side door tonight at midnight, as I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to the house of a friend up in the country who</seg><seg type="columnLine">will entrust me with a rare and delicate culture to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liver for him at a laboratory in Paris. I will, therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">go directly from his house to the steamer tomorrow, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will return without me. Dr. Blinkman and Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lecky will accompany me tonight, however, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will bring them back here. I am explaining these matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you so that you will understand why I do not return</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I will say goodby to you now, Stewart, as I will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">other things to occupy me tonight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus had the professor paved the way for the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night journey to the mausoleum, and nipped in the bud</seg><seg type="columnLine">any suspicion of foul play that might have been born of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peculiar circumstances under which he was to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait here," said Dr. Blinkman to the chauffeur,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"there is no road up to the house on this side, only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short cut through the woods. We will be back in half</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  While in sight of the furred figure on the front seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the limousine, the men went slowly with the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly in advance propelled by their hands on his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders. The chauffeur paused in the act of lighting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigarette to watch the three dark figures:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Now I wonder what the legal guy has to do with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip? Gee! doctors are all nuts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Once behind the shelter of the thick bushes and low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging branches, the two men picked up the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the head and feet and carried him swiftly up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a stiff climb to the mausoleum, and they laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">their burden down on the marble steps and stood gasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for breath, and wiping the sweat from their flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces, though the night was cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Neither spoke, an invisible finger of silence seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid upon their lips. The mausoleum was a magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure, perfectly round in shape with a row of fluted</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillars supporting the overhanging roof. It was encir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cled by a flight of shallow marble steps, and bronze bas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reliefs, typifying the immortality of the soul, formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight panels set deeply in the walls. The domed roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">was flattened at the top to receive a thick glass skylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was protected by an iron grill-work set in a leaden</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame. The bronze door swung outward, and was sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plemented by an inner door of iron studded with brass</seg><seg type="columnLine">nails. Ventilation was supplied by slits in the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the roof, and cunningly concealed in the pattern</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ornate frieze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the doors creaked open, Dr. Blinkman involun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily shrank back from the pitch-black interior, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">750</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lecky, more self-possessed or perhaps less imaginative,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into the inky chamber and felt along the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he found the electric light button. Instantly a flood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of soft radiance poured down upon the place and</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamed out across the marble steps on the dark form</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddled there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The floor was paved with blocks of black and white</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble. In the center stood a bronze sarcophagus lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">with softly padded white velvet. The sarcophagus was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unusual size; at the head was a pillow of white vel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vet for the professor's head to rest upon, and at the foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">an air-tight metal box containing food-tabloids and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle of champagne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bronze canopy supported on iron rods sheltered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarcophagus and completely concealed the open interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">from any inquisitive person who might climb to the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">and look down through the skylight. Heavy metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">fringes depended from this canopy all around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gently, almost reverently the two men laid Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hicks in his gruesome bed, arranged the velvet pillow</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath his head, straightened his white robe and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black cloak across the foot of the sarcophagus like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pall. A duplicate key was left by his side in case the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects of the serum should wear off sooner than ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light was then turned off and the doctor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawyer stepped out side by side into the chill March</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, closing and locking the heavy doors behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The cold light of a struggling moonbeam pierced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clouds and fell across the marble steps as they turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">once to look back; all else was in blackest shadow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">One Year Later</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A YEAR had passed since the March night when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Hicks had been secretly laid away in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marble mausoleum on the lonely hilltop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Blinkman again sat in the library awaiting the arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mr. Lecky and the representatives of the press.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With him was Professor Perkins, alert, keen-eyed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubbling over with scepticism. "Mark my words," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried, "you will find that I am right, and our learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend has been another martyr to the great cause of</seg><seg type="columnLine">science. Dear me! where do the others stay? It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">time we were off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I sent the car to the 8:15 to meet Mr. Lecky," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied the doctor," and the correspondents will also come</seg><seg type="columnLine">up by that train. They should all be here together in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Blinkman had improved with a year of easy living.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His form had taken on flesh, his face a ruddy color, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his manner the pomposity of one accustomed to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand. He had no fear of the result of the night's trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mausoleum; he felt sure that Hicks was dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">months ago of too much serum. He had tried heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">doses repeatedly on animals in the interim, and while they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lain without any signs of decay for a week or month,</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to the dose, at the end of that time all had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given indisputable evidence that they were dead. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had even kept several until the odor became unbearable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">desiring to convince himself beyond all doubt that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">serum was fatal in large doses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All his experiments had set his mind at rest. To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow everything would be his, he thought exultantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the blare of a motor-horn announced Mr. Lecky's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The lawyer was soon followed by a hired touring-car</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">containing the special correspondents who had been in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vited to the "resurrection."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After some light refreshments and a hasty explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion from Mr. Lecky regarding the nature of the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor's experiment, the entire party was on the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mausoleum within the hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night was clear and cold, the sky studded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of stars and the earth blanketed With a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall of snow. Stewart, hunched down in the front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limousine with his gloved hands on the wheel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed limit off, was turning matters over in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Darn funny," he was thinking, "this trip out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods again same time as last year, with all these strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">guys along too. Something I don't understand. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">professors are all crazy anyhow, but Hicks was a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">old scout. Wish he'd come back and give this Blinkman</seg><seg type="columnLine">bozo the air."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus ruminating, he arrived at the foot of the hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the hired car close behind, and the whole party</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled out in the snow, and started to climb the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">path Indian file, leaving the chauffeurs to gossip and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a footprint of man or beast had broken the smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow on the circular steps. The strange edifice rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimmering from the snows that banked it and hooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, white, cold, silent, a fit waiting-room on the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious route to eternity. Ice had filled the lock of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronze outer door and had to be thawed out with matches</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the key could be inserted. A reporter who car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried an electric flash-light threw the beam on the lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rest stood grouped at the bottom of the steps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all eyes and ears and shivering with cold and expectancy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By tacit consent, as the great door swung slowly out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, Dr. Blinkman, Professor Perkins, and the news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper men dropped back to let Mr. Lecky enter first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As on his first visit the preceding year he pressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">button in the wall and the electric light streamed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the interior from the rows of bulbs around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skylight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything was exactly as it was left twelve months</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One by one the awe-stricken men stepped softly in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered round the sarcophagus, staring down wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed upon the white face of Professor Hicks. No change</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken place in those frozen features; there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">indications of decay and neither were there any signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life. To all appearances he was still a dead man--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the hands of Mr. Lecky's watch pointed to ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes after midnight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor was overdue on his journey back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblivion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one moved, no one spoke, every eye was riveted</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwinkingly upon the rigid form stretched out under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bronze canopy, every heart beat madly with sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pense, and teeth chattered like castanets with excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the deadly cold of the tomb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One o'clock," said Professor Perkins at last as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocketed his watch.

Her bare white feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">were thrust into sandals of snowy leather, her superb</seg><seg type="columnLine">form was clothed only in a scant garment of thin white</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk that only reached to her dimpled knees and left her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and shoulders uncovered. . Her glorious golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair was confined by a fillet of silver studded with tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quoises, and anklets and armlets of the same jeweled</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal tinkled and clinked musically as she walked or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather glided forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suspended from a thick gold chain about her neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangled a cylinder about two inches long and of a dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">green substance. From her shoulder-blades extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad wings of a glittering, semi-transparent, mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">braneous material, and these beautiful wings she folded</seg><seg type="columnLine">as her feet touched the ground--apparently without voli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion just as a bird folds its pinions when it alights, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">really by touching a small protuberance set in a belt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white leather that crossed her full bosom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked around her, and her eyes caught the gleam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of marble through the trees. Stooping, she touched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs of her sandals and immediately a pair of little</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels sprang out under the soles; on these she rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly and rapidly toward the crumbling tomb. Rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stained its purity, sun and wind had cracked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumbled the cement that held the marble blocks to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether ; many of the columns had fallen and were buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">in weeds and debris, and the walls were half submerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a rising tide of soil, only the upper half of the bronze</seg><seg type="columnLine">door remaining above the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a temple of the dead," she exclaimed delightedly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and none are supposed to be in existence now.

Determined to find some fissure through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she could see the interior, she spread her majestic</seg><seg type="columnLine">white wings and rose above the roof, where she hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">poised in the sunlight, gazing down upon the fragments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the iron grill-work still adhering to the leaden frame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sheet of glass beneath it had long ago dropped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">been shattered on the bronze canopy below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The winged woman had a good view of the inside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mausoleum through the broken skylight, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied the bronze canopy-top with increasing interest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to conjecture what it could conceal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Resolving to find out and reap the glory of a first dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery, she alighted on the roof and removed the frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of iron still projecting around the edges of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening. The air that arose from within was cool and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet. She measured with her eye the distance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof to the flat top of the canopy beneath. She could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not make use of her wings in squeezing through the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row skylight, and the canopy appeared to be as solid as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marble walls. Seizing the sides of the aperture, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearlessly lowered herself through it until she hung by</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands, then let herself drop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When 150 pounds of solid, healthy womanhood struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the canopy exactly in the middle, the metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">supports snapped like so many pipe-stems and the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure heeled over like a full-rigged ship in a squall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spilled her on the floor, where she sat half stunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the fall and afraid to move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The floor was deep with fine gray dust mingled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shreds of black near the great sarcophagus. The canopy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had toppled to one side clear of the bronze coffin, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">now stood fully revealed. All around her on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">were little reddish heaps of rust like gouts of dry blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the metallic fringes had fallen. She had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the sarcophagus had no lid and was so frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the thought of the horrible unknown dead thing within</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, that she was about to unfold her wings and try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scramble out through the roof again when a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke the profound stillness and robbed her of strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a long, fluttering sigh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She closed her eyes in helpless terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When after at least ten minutes of absolute silence she</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventured to open them again, a large white hand was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangling over the side of the sarcophagus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She sat staring at it, mute, paralyzed, waiting for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead to rise and destroy her for having dared to invade</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sanctity of the tomb. Then a dark head appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a pair of broad shoulders, and a man sat up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked stupidly around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes wandered slowly round the bare, windowless</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, and rested on the beautiful intruder. He spoke in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thick, hoarse whisper, articulating the words with</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty like a child first learning to talk:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though trembling with fear, she understood him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once and answered timidly but clearly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Rosaria.

She was too amazed at this weird tete-a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tete to be frightened now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The truth was that a quick downward glance had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed to the professor the scandalous fact that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothed only in a layer of dust and a few tattered shreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his silk undergarments. It was a most embarrassing</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation to say the least, but probably it did more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock his dormant senses into their normal activity than</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything else could have done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Hicks was a very modest man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fair Rosaria was next to break the silence:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are dead, are you not?" she asked gravely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I never knew that the dead could speak. This must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be why we disperse them, so they cannot talk to us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bother us about their affairs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dead!" cried the professor, his voice still a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">husky, but growing stronger every minute as the return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flood of life swept through his veins. "I am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead, I'm very much alive. I have not the faintest idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">who you are or why you are here, but, no doubt, you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me why Dr. Blinkman and Mr. Lecky are not here</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my awakening. Perhaps I have recovered conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness too soon--or have I been longer than I expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be? My robe must have been destroyed by moths--</seg><seg type="columnLine">something I should certainly have guarded against."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The winged woman heard him through attentively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at once grasped his meaning. "I do not know your</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends," she declared, "but evidently you have over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept yourself. Why did you come to a place like this to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, an old-time temple of the dead, probably the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one left on earth; our dead have been dispersed now</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many generations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Hicks gasped, and in his agitation almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot his nudity and came near to leaping out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarcophagus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Generations!" he almost shrieked. "Good Heavens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl! how long have I been here ?

Then his voice rang out in a hoarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry of mingled astonishment and triumph:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The serum! the serum! it is more powerful than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. I can bridge the centuries for the human race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	can make man almost immortal. Animation has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended in me for two hundred years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He suddenly realized that he was hungry: two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred years is a pretty long time between meals for a full-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown man. He felt for the metal box of tabloids that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been placed at his feet. The hinges were gone from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lid, which had fallen off, and the tabloids were merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinches of powder. He picked up the bottle of cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pagne, struck off the neck on the side of the sarcophagus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drank thirstily. The wine was flat and sour, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">moistened his dry throat and parched tongue most</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceptably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something heavy and cold fell against his naked side;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the key to the door of the mausoleum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now my dear Miss Rosaria," he said, "I am placed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very peculiar position, which I will be able to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your entire satisfaction when I am a little stronger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Can you not procure me some clothes and something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat so that I can leave this terrible place? Here is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">key to the door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lifted the great key and threw it at her feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Rosaria shook her head:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The key is no use," she said, "the door is half under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground now. You can escape the way that I entered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through that hole in the roof."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced round at the walls which had enclosed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for two long centuries and shuddered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I cannot possibly go out in this condition, I must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to wear, and I am terribly impatient to breathe</seg><seg type="columnLine">the free air and walk on good old terra firma again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rosaria sprang to her feet:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will go at once," she cried, "do you wait here until</seg><seg type="columnLine">my return. I will fly back within the hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she stood up, she unfolded her white, glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings in such a way as to form a screen between herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the shrinking man who was vainly trying to hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the bottom of the bronze box. To the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor's amazement, she floated up to the roof like a bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a gigantic butterfly. Seizing the edge of the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her strong white hands, she deftly furled her wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Hicks stared, open-mouthed, and raising herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the aperture, spread them quickly again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soared up, up against the blue sky, until he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">her no longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The human race has developed wings like the angels</seg><seg type="columnLine">since I retired from the world," mused the professor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Many marvelous things must have happened while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fairly trembled in his eagerness to leave the mauso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leum and see for himself the progress the world had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose, stretched himself, clambered over the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sarcophagus and stood with his bare feet in the dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">of centuries. He walked over and pressed the electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">light button near the door; the button fell off in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. He gazed overhead at the patch of blue sky and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw what he took to be a large bird pass swiftly across</seg><seg type="columnLine">it; later he learned it was a man flying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon after he heard something on the roof and darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the fallen canopy, which afforded an excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen. Rosaria appeared at the opening and dropped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle through it. The professor crawled out from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the canopy, grabbed it and scurried back to shelter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bundle contained a garment of purple silk reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his ankles, a pair of white leather sandals with what</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like flat buttons at the heels and little folded fans</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the soles, and two long ribbed contrivances at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached tc^broad pieces of leather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could not imagine what they were intended for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after pushing and pulling them, trying to shut them</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and spread them open, he finally threw them aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">in disgust and attired himself in the robe and sandals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he was dressed he shouted boldly: "Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosaria! Miss Rosaria!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a swish overhead and the winged woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">knelt at the opening and looked in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dropped on that broken thing over there when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in. You see there is no room for me to use my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings, the aperture is too small. I could use them going</seg><seg type="columnLine">out because I could catch hold of the edge with one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fold them up with the other before I climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. But I can't, coming down. I'll have to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">on by both hands and drop. It is too far to the floor, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">you must stand up in the box and catch me. Only be</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful not to break my wings."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wonderingly, the professor climbed back in his bronze</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffin again, stood up to his full height and stretched out</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON WOMAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">753</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms. Fortunately, the roof was not very high and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could reach her ankles with his hands. So she rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">her pretty sandaled feet on his palms to steady herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">before she let go. The professor made a valiant effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to catch her, but staggered under her weight and both</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell in the bottom of the sarcophagus. With that white</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gold bundle of womanhood in his arms, the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor suddenly felt how silly all his crucibles and retorts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and serums had been. He could not even remember the</seg><seg type="columnLine">formula of the serum of suspended animation, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't care if he never remembered it now; it had served</seg><seg type="columnLine">its glorious purpose, it had bridged the centuries between</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and this super-girl, who was winged like an angel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he felt that he was through with all that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so important to him two hundred years ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time in his two hundred and thirty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, the professor was in love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Laughing, but not in the least embarrassed, the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable Rosaria disentangled herself from the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor's arms and sprang lightly out upon the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" she exclaimed, "where are your wings ? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't you put them on ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My wings?" said the bewildered professor feebly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have no wings, my dear Miss Rosaria. Nobody had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings in my time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," she said calmly, "I don't suppose they were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented then. Eat your lunch and afterwards I will help</seg><seg type="columnLine">you put them on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From a silver box delicately enameled in colors hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from her wrist by a slender chain, she produced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of small vials bearing tiny labels, and filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">differently colored liquids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rosaria enumerated the various edibles as she handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him these vials:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Roast beef, wheat, chicken salad, cheese, potatoes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oranges, coffee and wine. These," she explained, "are</seg><seg type="columnLine">extracts of the essences of the foods and drinks I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">just named. By reducing them to the actual concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated essences necessary to nourish the human system,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we avoid taking waste matter into our stomachs. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thus eliminated a great deal of unnecessary work</seg><seg type="columnLine">and solved the servant trouble and expense that used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be such a great source of annoyance to our grandmothers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The kitchen range and sink have disappeared with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">butler's pantry and the storeroom. There are no meat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markets, no grocery-stores, no dairies; everything we eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drink is prepared by the government laboratories</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sold in drug stores. A year's supply of food for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">family of eight persons may be kept in a small cellarette."</seg><seg type="columnLine">By this time the professor had swallowed his lunch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While he felt sustained and wonderfully strengthened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the essences, at the same time it seemed too much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking medicines to be enjoyable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROSARIA now assisted the professor to strap on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings with the broad leather belt, explaining as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did so, that they were controlled by a tiny spring on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breast which turned on or off at will the electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">current drawn from the body of the wearer, which also</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled the action of the wings. It was all so beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tifully simple, the professor wondered why nobody had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of it before the clumsy airplane of his time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented. With a little practice and the help of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">charming companion he was soon able to balance him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self quite well in the air, though he could only rise a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot or so above the floor in the restricted space of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomb. But when he attempted to catch the edge of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">skylight opening and climb out, one of his wings collided</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently with the roof because he forgot to touch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring, and snap went a rib.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poor Professor Hicks tumbled to the floor and pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosaria wrung her hands in dismay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is too bad," she cried. "It would have been so easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go out that way. Now I will have to use my radio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic and partly destroy your lovely temple."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She touched the small, dull-green cylinder that hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her neck:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All women carry them," she said, "for since every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body flies who can afford to buy, borrow, rent or steal a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of wings, it is not safe for any woman to fly out</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone without being able to protect herself. I hate to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoil your temple though."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not a temple," exclaimed the professor hastily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"it is just a tomb, a place to put the dead in away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. There were much finer ones than this. Don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">be afraid to wreck it, I--I hate it!" he jerked out dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gustedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," she asked suddenly, "did they keep you ? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't they disperse you? Or did you die long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">our method of dissolving the dead into nothingness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">adopted ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "People were either entombed in the earth or in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crypt or mausoleum like this in my time, or were cre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mated," he replied. "I never heard of any other way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disposing of the deceased--unless with quicklime,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was only used on the bodies of criminals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" said Rosaria, "how funny! It must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreadfully unhealthy to have a lot of dead people lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you do with them now?" inquired the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We disperse the remains," she answered. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">coroner turns a powerful X-ray upon a body and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanishes, resolves into nothingness. It is so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaner--and cheaper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you use that little gun of yours on the locks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these doors?" asked the professor, impatient to get out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just then the marvelous X-ray did not interest nearly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as the thought of freedom. The very idea of hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing spent two hundred years in the limited space of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble chamber almost stifled him. He wanted to feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cool winds of heaven on his brow, hear the songs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the birds, touch the green leaves once more. The serum</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not interest him, now that he could look at Rosaria's</seg><seg type="columnLine">exquisite profile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't get out of that door," said his fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliverer. "It is closed and the earth is banked against</seg><seg type="columnLine">it half way to the top. I will make an opening above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level of the ground as nearly as I can judge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She lifted the little cylinder and pointed it straight at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marble wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Hicks heard no report, saw no flash, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost immediately a tiny bubble was traveling rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the smooth surface, and as it moved, the marble</seg><seg type="columnLine">melted beneath it until a fissure an inch wide appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rosaria still stood with the little cylinder extended as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if taking aim. The bubble on the wall vanished when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had covered a foot and another bubble took its place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled the same distance and a third bubble continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crack. This was succeeded by a fourth and a fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">until three sides of a square was formed.

Yet I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not reject any theory which seems to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">plausible. Rather I look for holes in it. I am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a regular reader of your magazine, but when I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">read it, I read it thoroughly. I am patient with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your authors. I don't kill the enjoyment of a story</seg><seg type="columnLine">by assuring myself that each incident that is dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed is impossible. But I do object to obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">incongruities. In particular, I refer to two</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious mistakes in "The Dimension Segregator."</seg><seg type="columnLine">While I enjoyed this story, still I am skeptical.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The author refers to an absolutely solid metal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he claims (through his character in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story) is made by subjecting iron to a temperature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of absolute zero.

When there is nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangible to react on, I claim a rocket must stop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I picture a rocket outside of the earth's atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a man trying to row a boat with his oars beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the story, Doctor Grey did not state just how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go about amputating a limb instantly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not talking to another surgeon but to an elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical engineer, who very probably knew little--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cared less--about the surgical possibilities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Doctor's discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In place of mentioning De Kruiff's Microbe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunters (which, as it happens, contains the facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned in the first three paragraphs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story), I might have said that Doctor Grey's desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">held several volumes of bacteriological reference</seg><seg type="columnLine">books, including the Handbuch dcr Immunitats-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forschung uttd experimentcllcn Therapie, by Kraus</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Levaditi, Die expcrimcntelle Bakteriologic, etc.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Kolle and Hetsch, as well as other works by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Park and Williams, Jordan, Zinser, Kolmer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hewlett. My reason for not doing so is entirely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal one. When I read a story and the author</seg><seg type="columnLine">refers to a certain book, I usually read the book</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it is available in the public library and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viding it is not too technical. I believe that other</seg><seg type="columnLine">readers do the same. While I do not have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking (or reading) acquaintance with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">above mentioned works, I fear that the butcher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the baker, and--well, the average man with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">average education--would find little pleasure in</seg><seg type="columnLine">these books, and it is Mr. Average Man who sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports magazines, as he forms the large majority</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the reading public. I do believe, however, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the average reader might read, understand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoy the Microbe Hunters. The names of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">above mentioned bacteriological reference books</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be welcomed by readers of such a magazine</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not by the casual reader in search of entertain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have only the following comment to make on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the criticism on searching for dead microbes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guinea pig's blood.

Without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> entering into the subleties of the question of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> criticism, I think that the editor and most of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> readers will agree as to the great importance and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> usefulness of even sharp criticism. Firstly, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> strongly dislike your name, and agree heartily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> with the great number-of your readers who re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> quest you to change the name. From the first time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I read Amazing Stories (which is just a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> months ago) I have felt that a name something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> like "Scientifiction" or "Scientifiction Tales"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> would draw a greater number of readers by not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> awakening at first sight such unpleasant associa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tion as "Amazing Stories" does. In a general</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> way I am afraid that with a few exceptions, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amazing Stories do not possess a very high</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> literary standard. Particularly do I object to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> use of slang or argot by many of the staid scien-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tific characters. Real men of science, and espe-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cially those of such exceptional merit, which the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stories usually depict, seldom use ungrammatical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and inelegant language. I think that some of your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> authors could learn much by taking lessons in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> style and structure from that great master of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scientifiction, H. G. Wells. Besides, being par-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ticularly familiar with his works, I note that he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> is probably the most original of such writers, most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of the ideas of time-traveling, interplanetary flying,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> extraordinary growth, etc., being due to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again I think I may bring an example from Wells</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in the question of the part love should play in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> these tales. Wells, who is surely one of the most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> popular of writers, has hardly ever used the motif</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of love in his fantastic tales. Of course, I do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> not mean to convey that love should be entirely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> eliminated, but I do say that it surely ought to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> play a more subordinate part than it usually does.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking up the question of scientific inconsistencies,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> which is perhaps the most important of all and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> main object of this criticism, I notice for instance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in your August issue; the idea of long distance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hypnotism as practised by Philip Barton is in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> compatible with the accepted law of psychology--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that no person may be hypnotized against his or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> her will. Again, when the Inquisitor goes up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 20 miles, I do not see how and why its height</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> makes it independent of the rotation of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Its initial speed (that of the earth's rotation) is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> practically the same 20 miles up, as on the surface</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of the earth. And then again, Philip Barton's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> method of changing a person's character, lacks, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> am afraid, any scientific basis. In "The Dimen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sion Segregator," iron is reduced to absolute zero,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> which is impossible, at least according to the basic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> principles of modern science. Then again</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tulane's segregation ray consists of a mixture of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> radium rays and electro-magnetic waves inter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mediate in frequency between ultra-violet and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> X-rays, which modify one another's properties in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> order to form the segregating ray. This is in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> direct contradiction to Physics, which teaches us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that electro-magnetic and other rays do not modify</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> another's properties, but rather act oblivious of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> each other's presence. It would seem that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> author has used a chemical analogy (of t!.e com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pound in Physics). In "Out of the Void" I cannot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> exactly understand what the second sun is, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> perhaps that was made clear in the second instal-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ment. And then I think our interplanetary hero</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and heroine might easily have landed on Mars by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stopping the powder charges. Then Mars might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> have called them, as there would be no defying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> force. Let me now give the ante.

It is perfectly fair to have shown that it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has developed so that a person can be hypnotized</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against his will.

As a body rises above the earth, its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weight becomes less, owing to the. reduced gravita-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tional pull exerted by the earth. Therefore its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">angular velocity would constantly decrease as its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">radius relative to the centre of the earth becomes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">greater and greater, so that after a while it will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lag behind very rapidly because in order to retain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its position in that radius it would have to go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">faster and faster.

Up to now,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">however, I have not followed this desire u*p.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Amazing Stories is the one magazine that I take</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the newsstand without looking inside of it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first. I know I will find interesting reading every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time and so far I have never been mistaken. I do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not like your cover, however, but that is only from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my own viewpoint, as I believe that it actually</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">helps your magazine a lot. There is one story,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Out of the Void," that I wish to criticize. So</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">far as I can see, there is little real science in this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">story and a lot of incorrect science. For instance,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how could this planet Abrui be out between</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Uranus and Neptune without having been dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">covered by Astronomers on Earth? Its personal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sun alone would be visible, while it must exert</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quite a bit of influtence over Uranus, thus making</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it impossible for Astronomers to have been able to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">locate Neptune by mathematical calculation. Also</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little thought seems to have been given to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dangers faced in a trip through space such as that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taken. I take the stand that such a trip would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be an almost absolute physical impossibility for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two reasons. The first is meteorites, of which it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is well known our solar system is full. As their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">journey was long, they must have passed near to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">countless thousands of such bodies. I would say</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that it woiWd be about a thousand to one for them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to get through without being hit by one, and no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such rocket could stand being hit by a couple of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tons or more of iron traveling at the terrific speeds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they do. The second is planetoids. They passed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">right through the center of the whole mass of them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and yet they were not hit or attracted to one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Very strange. Well, I read the story anyhow, in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stead of giving up in disgust as my attitude might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suggest. I do hope, however, that in the future</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">your interplanetary stories will be more interesting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and more correct than this one. One thing that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has interested me greatly is the nullification of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gravity. It seems to me that in stories dealing with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the writers forget one thing and that is the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">revolving of the earth. If a solid body was com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pletely without gravity, I should think that as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the earth revolved, it would stay where it was in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">space. Thus it would appear to travel toward the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">west at a great speed. Because of the wind created</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by its progress, it would not travel as fast as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the earth was revolving at that space. Of course</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it would fly off, or rather appear to fly off into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">space. What I would like to know is whether it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would create much heat going through the atmos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">phere at that speed? Another form of this nulli-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fication of gravity is when something is made that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nullifies the gravity of everything above it. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that case I should think that the air above it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be continually rushing off toward the west</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">instead of shooting straight up as some authors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would have us believe. Probably quite a wind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be created. One thing that worries me is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the fact that light gases such as helium and hy-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drogen, though apparently out of the attraction of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gravity, do not act in this manner. Wait a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">minute. That's wrong. They rise, not because</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of lack of gravity, but because they are lighter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than air. Thus a balloon, if the former were the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">case, would keep on going right out into space,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but it doesn't.

As a rule I have found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more mistakes in the criticisms of the stories than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the stories themselves. One letter in particular</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from John H. Penkard, Jr., age 16. Being six-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">teen myself, I feel more at ease in commenting on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his letter. As a whole, the letter is scientifically</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">accurate, with this exception: if a clock could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">travel at the speed of light, the hands would not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turn while it was traveling at this speed, because</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no time would elapse. I think John's thoughts are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a little astray on this subject. If it were possible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for a clock to travel at the speed of light and exist,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and if it were possible for us to travel along behind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it, we woitfd see the hands move at the same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speed as ordinarily. But if we were in front of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the clock, we couldn't see it at all, for the light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waves emitted by it would never reach our eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">since we are traveling fast enough to keep ahead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of them. If we could fly off this earth faster</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than light, we might review the Battle of Waterloo</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">since we would eventually catch up with its light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">■waves. All action would be reversed, however;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smoke would re-enter the gun muzzles and dead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men would rise from the field. Another writer,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Leon Rosenthal by name, stated that if the people</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the "Green Prism" story were the size of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">atoms, then the electrons of the atoms composing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a molecule of water would appear the size of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tennis balls and would revolve hundreds of feet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the nucleus. But if the atoms are the size</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the people, then the electrons could be no more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than three feet from the nucleus. Furthermore, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">electrons would not be visible, since they compare</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the nucleus as a baseball might compare to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth.

It is perfectly fair to say that a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">third eye would greatly improve our perspective,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or more properly, our stereoscopic vision.

An extraordinary theory has even been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">advanced, based on the location of the pituitary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gland in the head, that the gland cavity or cells</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">may represent the place where formerly mankind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had a third eye.

It consists of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speed, time and wind resistance chiefly. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">known muzzle velocity of a Springfield, model 1917,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caiiber .30, U. S. army rifle is, theoretically, 2,700</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feet per second. Assuming a train going 2,700 feet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">per second has two men standing 50 feet apart; the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man on the rear of a car on the train (50 feet in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back of the first man) fired a .30 caliber Army rifle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the man in front of him. Remember, the train</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is also going 2,700 feet per second. Would you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">give me a full explanation of this problem? I am</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a regular reader of "Discussions," and enjoy them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">intensely. I think they are great. I would appre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ciate it very much if you would explain this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">problem. Personally I believe the bullet would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not hit him, because the wind resistance would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be too great. What do you think ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                        J. Chas.

This was asked more than a century</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ago. His answer was that it would be bad for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the cow. If all was done as you described, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be very bad for the man in front of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gun. The speed of the train would be without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">effect upon the relation of the two men or upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the rifle bullet, except to create a wind, which, of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">course, would change its velocity. The point is,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the bullet would leave the gun with a velocity</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of 2,700 feet due to the powder plus another 2,700</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feet due to the motion of the train. Therefore,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it would go at 5,400 feet velocity per second and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the wind would not bring it to a stop at once.--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Editor.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  INTERPLANETARY STORIES A TREAT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Editor, Amazing Stories:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    I have just received my September Issue of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Amazing Stories and it certainly had some fine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  stories in it.
