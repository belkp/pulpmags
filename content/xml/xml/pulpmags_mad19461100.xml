The passage out to New Spain</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the homeland had been nearly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull as were the streets of Nombre de</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dios. A man must fight dullness as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fights an enemy. In Cordoba the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Espadin had long been noted for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">skill at gaming. Guala! Who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">think a man of that house could lose his</seg><seg type="columnLine">modest fortune in a single ship-board</seg><seg type="columnLine">game--and make an enemy, besides?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet It was so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Espadin grinned ruefully and shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the wall against which he idly</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned. The woman on the walk passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He no more than saw her, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned inward on his misfortune. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">could a man guess that the simpering</seg><seg type="columnLine">dandy he had so elegantly insulted at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain's table was a man of note</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this city? Foul luck, nothing more!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It now appeared that Dario Lozan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only a man of note, but that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">family ruled this colony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behold, city guards had sought Espa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">din within an hour of his landing. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain was a Vicente Lozan. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought an order banning the Cavalier</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juan Espadin from Nombre by sunset.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was signed by Reinaldo Lozan, Gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor. Behind the order was the threat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old Inquisition, recently revived</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this colony, and Alfredo Lozan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief Inquisitor of Nombre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Por Dios, the Lozan were numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs! Espadin shrugged. He must leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city. But how? Along through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle swamps across the isthmus to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panama? Foolhardy he might be, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fool--no! The beasts and brigands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that steamy dark made no distinction</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the rich and honest men. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was yet three days until a train of silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">mules and a company of soldiery would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the trip. Wait or stay, it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Espadin shifted again. A stir drew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his lagging interest up the street. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman with the shawl--and a man. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to turn away. Had not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman passed within a yard of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">without casting so much as a glance at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him--without raising one spark of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest in return? She must be, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hag under her veil. It was the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who interested him. An old pig. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">showy. The Toledo blade at his side</seg><seg type="columnLine">v&gt;as too long for his arms. He was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasty, without a swordsman's grace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he lacked an Espadin's judgment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I7SPADIN started leisurely up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. It was not his affair, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man should not wear the gear of a cav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alier without first learning the duties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a gentleman. The man had a firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip on one of the woman's arms, halt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her. He turned angrily at Juan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch. Juan saw an arrogant face which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was somehow familiar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tall friend," he told the face with</seg><seg type="columnLine">formality, "the lady has grown already</seg><seg type="columnLine">weary of you. I tell you this to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">embarrassment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Embarrassment!" the man pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested hotly. "You misbegotten swine!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hands off, hands off! You accost me?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Todos los santos! I'll read you a les-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son--!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only the great could afford such an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger over so small a matter. Espadin</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered who this spindly old follower</seg><seg type="columnLine">of veiled women might be. But it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint curiosity. He stepped back a pace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as the man's long Toledo scraped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its scabbard, his own Cordoban</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel sang in his hand. He was stiff from</seg><seg type="columnLine">long weeks on shipboard. He took no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. A man and his sword seldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">look alike and a clever wrist is often in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old arm. He made a single feint and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set his point a handbreath into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fellow bleated as though struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CASSOCK AND THE SWORD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nigh to death and sagged to his knees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Espadin caught a fistful of velvet in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crown of the man's fanciful hat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped his blade clean of such thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood He bowed then, and spoke pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My advice, Senor--it comes free</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a pinking. Forget the lady--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a shorter blade. It takes a stout</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to make a cloth-yard of Toledo</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance properly!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outraged, the man gave over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">moaning and began to shout for assist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guardia municipal! Aqui! Aqui!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Help, brigands! I am killed! Bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers, bring police! Swiftly!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sharp blow struck the calf of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juan's leg. He wheeled. Only the wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">an was behind him. She had swept back</seg><seg type="columnLine">her veil, exposing the face of a red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lipped. warm-eyed saint. Espadin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned. Por Dios, how could he have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made such a mistake? A hag--ai!--</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps in a hundred years. But beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful, now! This old fool who thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shoulder pink a mortal wound had</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed better judgment than a Cordo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ban.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ah, well, a man is entitled to one mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take. And he should be in favor. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beauty could feel but nausea at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old goat who had halted her. She would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be grateful for a cavalier. And, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps, there would be reward. Bien for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunat Even in Nombre de Dios an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terprising man might find an end to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dullness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Espadin bent low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Senorita--" he said, ''Juan Espadin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Cordoba--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old goat left off bellowing. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes sharpened malevolently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Espadin?" he snarled. "I shall re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member that name!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the same instant the girl's thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirts rustled and a sharply shod little</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot struck Juan's leg again solidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And she loosed a torrent of bitter abuse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fool! Pig! You and your hasty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword! Before God. I hate cava-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liers! For three days I have baited my</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap. Then, when my game at last is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand, you spit him! You, then, can</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to Brother Paco when he asks</seg><seg type="columnLine">where is this worst of the Lozans--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrion I promised to bring him!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Espadin saw soldiery at the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the street, all too plainly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste. He stood motionless, appalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the continuing flavor of his luck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This--" he choked, "--this is also</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Lozan?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl nodded. Then she saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards. Wrapping her skirts close, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran. Another company of soldiers ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared at the upper end of the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting off escape. The girl ignored</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, running lightly and with the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posefulness of one who knows where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she goes. Espadin looked at the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">companies of city guardsmen--doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less numbering among them still more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the innumerable clan which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to flush like rats from the stones of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nombre. He felt a tightness in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pues, he was a clever fellow! He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulted one of a family. He had ig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nored the orders of another. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had pinked a third to make certain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their affection. All for the whiling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dull afternoon and a girll</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Juan Espadin was not a man to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a woman. The dignity of a cava-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lier set certain limits in such matters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the guards were close. He over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the girl as she dodged into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway of a large house which backed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the outer wall of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          Jungle Friar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^HE house was empty, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">long deserted. The girl raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">through dusty rooms to a door set in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear wall of the last. The planking</seg><seg type="columnLine">was old. It stuck under her hand. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardia sounded close in the street. Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">padin hit the door, drove it open, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled with drawn sword to face the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards should they break into the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the girl had a fair start. But she</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled insistently at his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This way will be useless to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brotherhood, now!" she panted. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be watched, thanks to the alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">you raised. But we're safe from here</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Come--!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Espadin obeyed. The door let into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tunnel under the city wall. The tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel ended in a thicket. The girl found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trail with the ease of familiarty. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell of the city faded with the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. In its place was the damp aroma</seg><seg type="columnLine">of growing things and the perpetual</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight of rank, tree shaded under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth. The swamp--the jungle!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Espadin was uneasy. He was a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see things as they were. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what kind of government was set up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the favored nobles sent out by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the King to rule his colonial lands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were Indians in this jungle who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would admire a fine Spanish head like</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own as a token of revenge for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">injustices. And there were brigands</seg><seg type="columnLine">who would count a knife-stroke fair ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">change for the privilege of feeling of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl ran untroubled through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom. She ran lightly and steadily. Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">padin was vain of his body. He gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">it certain care and it served him ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceedingly well. Yet he was drenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sweat and his lungs were heaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the girl at last stopped in a broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She gave him a glance yet tinged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterness and whistled--a shrill sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">from such soft lips. The whistle echoed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the clearing was suddenly full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Some were Indians, sullen faced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and shadowy. More were brigands. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest were the poor which crowd the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets of any colonial city--victims of</seg><seg type="columnLine">swindle and false hopes and rapacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxation. They were a strange crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the strangest was a round, ruddy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced man with a bushy fringe of gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair around a red and shining pate. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore the robe of a holy order, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a teacher from the College</seg><seg type="columnLine">of King's Wrestlers at Cadiz. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocky body was as solid as the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Nombre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The face was that of a man Espadin</seg><seg type="columnLine">could savor, with the color of a bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of claret and the genial humor af Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laga from a cask. Little round eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">winked measurement and the robed</seg><seg type="columnLine">man turned to the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not Reinaldo, not Alfredo, not Vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cente, not Dario--nay, nor any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. This is no Lozan! Pepita, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have disappointed us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl nodded grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ail" she spat. "And ask this one</seg><seg type="columnLine">why! He is yours, Paco. He owns a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift blade. Where is Father Monte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">santo? I must talk with him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brother Paco tipped his head toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great tree beyond the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the chapel, still.

Brother Paco called after</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pepita--you had word from your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl's voice floated back heavily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Does a man speak from the Inquisi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with Lozans in the church?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BROTHER PACO frowned darkly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Suddenly he wheeled back to Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">padin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Friend, your catechism!"

When Reinaldo Lozan became</seg><seg type="columnLine">governor of Nombre, he wrought many</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes. Father Montesanto, bishop</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the city, was driven out to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">room for a friend of the Lozan who also</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore the cloth. Felipe de Ardenas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">commander of the old guards, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought before the governor and or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered to levy taxes for the Lozan as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as the King. He was also ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pass the keys and hiding place of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old city's treasury to the Lozan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These things he refused. He was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to the Chambers of Inquisition, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in Father Montesanto's time, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody enough since.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remember these things well.

You have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to us by Felipe's daughter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosalia de Ardenas, whom we call</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pepita. Those who hate the Lozans</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gathered here. Those who have</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered find shelter with us.

Among other duties, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as preserving his life and health, Espa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">din had a fortune to regain. This com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany seemed barren ground. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of acquaintance with rank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth, the company of silks and velvet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he was to fare well in this land. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark of this swamp depressed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I travel toward Panama," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am delayed only until I can reach a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mule-train on the highway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brother Paco shook his head grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only members of the brotherhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">may stay one night in our haven.

I was cornered, but one of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">frocked jailers for the Inquisition was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hand. He suffered accident. I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his robe. Fleeing as a friar and hotly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed, I passed the house of Felipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">d&lt;? Ardenas. I thought the house empty,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but a girl beckoned from its door. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed and she showed me a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the city wall into the jungle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here in the sw'amp I would have bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained for a change of clothing.

Since,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the good father talks most earn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">estly with El Senor Dios, Pepita and</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself make certain small forays on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nombre which feed our hatred and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellies of the good father's flock at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time. But Nombre is still in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of that cursed family. They sack</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as no Englishman has yet dared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. And we strike no real blow in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paco wiped at his broad red forehead</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the wide sleeve of his cassock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tell to you I am sick on it!

As-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suredly, Pepita had offered an exchange</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her father. And a man could find</seg><seg type="columnLine">much joy in the face of a grateful</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman.

His face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still genial but his eyes turned sly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ye'll not go, Juanito?" he asked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mock astonishment. "Not even for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure locked in Nombre?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This ill-assorted friar had mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure before. The treasury of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old city, the hiding place of which Fe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lipe de Ardenas would not reveal, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">before torture. Perhaps the former cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of the guards now had enough of</seg><seg type="columnLine">torture. Having been offered a trade</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the daughter, it was possible a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewd man might make another with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the father. The treasure of old Nombre</seg><seg type="columnLine">would handsomely replace the modest</seg><seg type="columnLine">funds with which Juan had parted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipboard. It was the curse of the Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">padins to be hasty in all things--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">with 'no' for an answer. A man should</seg><seg type="columnLine">consider things well. Juan shrugged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have a plan?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paco's grin gave way to hearty, open</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ail Juanito, Juanito, art as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dog as Paco!" he roared.

The Inquisition lies in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old building back of the cathedral.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is dark of the moon and guards will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be many, I think. Then, there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">my robe. However far it takes us, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will go as friar and friend. After that</seg><seg type="columnLine">--quick steel, hard thrusting, and swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreat. When we have Felipe de Arde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nas out of that cursed prison, we talk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him of golden bars. You see it so?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juan nodded, not without uneasiness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not the nature of a Cordoban to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take another's planning for a risky</seg><seg type="columnLine">night's work.

A dark, walled yard, closed at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower end by a darker building. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the Inquisition. Built in the days</seg><seg type="columnLine">when madmen were masters of the colo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nial church, and for the express purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of converting unbelievers by all the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plements of torture known to savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, the evil of the practice yet clun£</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the building. Here was proof of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody tyranny of the Lozan s--the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient building reopened and its forget-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten tortures put to their own use!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paco nudged his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Walk softly, Juanito!" he whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered.

The robed man--priest or</seg><seg type="columnLine">masquerading whelp of the Lozans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whichever he might be--appeared satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied. There was but now to make an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try into the building ahead, silence such</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards as might be within, and escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Felipe de Ardenas. The sheen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelted gold was already lighting Espa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">din's eyes when a bellow set up at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate of the courtyard.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled to see Paco clawing himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with amazing agility up the rough stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of one of the cathedral butt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resses.

He struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily and fought to his knees. There,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as his hand locked to the hilt of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his sword, the haft of a pike caught him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The solid pole of wood rang brazen</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder in his head and night vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a deeper blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavalier and Soldier</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JN TIME Espadin had an impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a thin, cruel-faced youngster</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing over him and a kick in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribs which was more than an impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion.

A flambeau was thrust into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sconce on the wall. Smoky torchlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung unsteady shadows of strange and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody machines against the wall. Eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolts studded the mossy stone, dangling</seg><seg type="columnLine">manacles and fetters. In one place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an erect scarecrow of a man who still</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung to pride although his limbs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent and knotted from stretching on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was strength and a bravery in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pain-scarred face which sickened a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with pity. Espadin turned his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his fellow prisoner just as another</seg><seg type="columnLine">kick crashed against his own chest. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">coughed with agony. Dario Lozan</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Art a bravo now.

It was not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good man's nose-dust but some fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfumed stuff. Lozan drew an affected</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath of pleasure in his vice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think of these things, Cordoban,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he suggested thinly. "We give you a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little time--to dawn, it may be. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think in good company. Yonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Felipe de Ardenas, who loves street</seg><seg type="columnLine">beggars better than the honor and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold of the governor's favor.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a deep silence in which Espadin</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the throb of his hurts and fed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger with explosive fuel.

The blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of De Ardenas ran strongly in father</seg><seg type="columnLine">and daughter alike. The old man be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved he was a decoy placed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lozans. Juan could see no way to gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old soldier's trust. This troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. There was stubborness in Espadin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had come to this den of deviltry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescue this man. He would not go with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out him. The cowardice of false friars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sanguine torture of a colony's petty</seg><seg type="columnLine">tyrants, the distrust of De Ardenas--be</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned to them all. An Espadin</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked no return way empty handed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There would be an answer when a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thinking thus, Espadin slept, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weary body victor over the restlessness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his mind. When he wakened it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, a vague change from night in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit where the Lozans used old tools to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break men who brooked their will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUAN was barely roused when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door again opened. Two hooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards appeared with pikes and a flam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beau. With them were two more, hooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">also, but stripped to the waist in earnest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coming labors. Felipe de Ardenas</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw these and cackled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The play is to be perfect, eh?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled. "I am to feel pity for this one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so not guard my tongue! Fools,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'tis useless, I tell you!

This father of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pepita was a hard man to convince!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The guards spoke no words. Juan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped to his clout. Such gear as</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not earlier been taken from him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was added to his baldric and rapier</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the finery he had purchased in Lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bon. The lot was carelessly cast in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouldy dust of one corner. Espadin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was spread-eagled and lashed on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back across the frames of a rack The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wraiths of Satin who wore no tunics</seg><seg type="columnLine">put themselves at the capstans which</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced the frames of the rack apart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wooden screws turned slowly, building</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure until they cried in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sockets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When joints stretched unbearably,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juan Espadin denied their pain. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened his mind on the hills of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">homeland, the good Malaga in village</seg><seg type="columnLine">casks, the ancients and the wise of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clan who had wed his hand to Cordoban</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel--and on Pepita. The salt taste of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood came in his mouth, for a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth must shred flesh when he cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry out. But his lips remained closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In mid-morning Dario Lozan bent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's asked for a priest?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nay!" one of the bare chested</seg><seg type="columnLine">giants growled surlily. "Not a groan</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him yet--and soon his flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A pity!" Lozan said carelessly. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hoped the priest would already be</seg><seg type="columnLine">here--one of our own. What things</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Cordoban dog with such a sword-arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have to confess! Ah, well, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for later, eh? Perhaps a turn or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. But end it there for today. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man should have time for the repenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sins!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the afternoon not even Pepita or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the green hills of Spain could vie with</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony. Only hatred could meet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenge. But there had to be an end</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it. There is a limit to all hatreds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trials of all flesh. A haven of dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness loomed and Espadin plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly into it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He roused, aching and sick, to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jailers had been carelessly certain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ruin they had worked. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung him prone in the ancient filth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor, scorning the effort of support-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him upright long enough to snap</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fetters. Juan moved heavy limbs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">found them free, and felt hope. Felipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">de Ardenas heard the movement. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not for favor or gold would any</seg><seg type="columnLine">man endure what I have seen you suffer</seg><seg type="columnLine">this day!

But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not know your face--you are not of</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Nombre--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--" Juan said hoarsely, "--of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cordoba--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke slowly, then, bitterly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">told the old man of his fortunes ashore</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this colony of the King.

De Ardenas muttered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Plies, it is not impossible--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">r^'HE old man spoke swiftly. Juan</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened, chafing and flexing mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated limbs. Water was brought by</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom after sunset. And by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards. One possessed keys. A ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword--a pair of swift strokes--quien</seg><seg type="columnLine">sabe? The plan was made. Came then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time of waiting in which Espadin</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked and further loosened outraged</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles. He paced restlessly, his rapier</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched in stiffened fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The waiting ended with little warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The two guards came briskly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Espadin, earnest of no failure, drove his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon too deeply into the body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with the water crock and so lost his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip on its hilt. Startled, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard thrust out with the flambeau in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of the short broad-pike in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Espadin caught the thrusting arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke it at the elbow with a twist of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body, and seized the flambeau. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming torch was a terrible weapon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man's head shattered dully. Espa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">din tore a brace of keys from him be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the guard began to fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His manacles had cruelly chafed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Felipe de Ardenas at throat, wrists, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankles. He winced as Juan fumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the locks. But when the fetters fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">away he retrieved a guard's broad-pike</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hobbled for the door. His face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stone mask, set in a smile of terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy. Juan tore his own sword free and</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined his companion in the corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the dungeon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passage slanted upward, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">through an outer door into the court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard above.

"If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it free without me, tell Rosalia I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have counted you friend this night. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">will carry your suit far with her! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ask no man's help with a woman!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Espadin growled. "Beside, a man must</seg><seg type="columnLine">live before he loves. We started to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. We finish the same.

Juan un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood. Leaving him unfettered had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been but another form of torture. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lozans had known he would try escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had been waiting like cats at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I said it, my uncle!

But before rapier met pike</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broad-pike met lance, a terrible yell</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ranks of the guardia wavered</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the courtyard gate.

The guards fell back, trembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at collapse. Suddenly a fierce mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">company poured without warning from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a side street. Two men rode at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. One was Vicente Lozan, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had succeeded De Ardenas as captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guards. The other was a fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">man so pompous that he could be only</seg><seg type="columnLine">His Excellency, Reinaldo Lozan, Gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor of Nombre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">r'pHE wild ones bunched against this</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack.

''No wench and no door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I do know a passage.

He found a ledge in the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, travelled it many yards to a but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tress by which he climbed to a higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">level. There was another ledge, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tile drain all too insecurely fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the towering wall. From this they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a third foothold on which a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of great height and hard stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">far below seized Espadin. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paco vanished from in front of him. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment later he found a casement open</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crawled through, also. A room</seg><seg type="columnLine">took vague shape. Dull metal gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from shelving. Juan understood Paco's</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CASSOCK AND THE SWORD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of this entry to the palace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a few moments a man without prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciple might load a sack with enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver to provide a month's good living</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cannisters and state goblets</seg><seg type="columnLine">stored here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paco pulled open a door, stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously into a long hall. Juan fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him. The far end opened into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairwell from which short corridors led</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a number of apartments on what</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be the front of the third floor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palace. A heavy, gated grill closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head of the stairs. Four guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on duty at the gate. Paco nudged</seg><seg type="columnLine">Espadin, pointing to the belt of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these. Keys hung there. The meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear. These guards could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked without alarm. Yet should</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gate be closed and locked, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor would be cut off from the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house--and reenforcements. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">well protected, this floor could be none</seg><seg type="columnLine">other than the haven of the Lozans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juan nodded at his companion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">freed his steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they had done before, Espadin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Paco moved as one. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clash of steel, a curse, and one cry be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause Paco was clumsy--and painful--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his first thrust. Before his own sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond victim struck the floor, Espadin</seg><seg type="columnLine">slammed the gate closed. Alarm rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor below. Guards thundered</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the stairs. Paco's stubby fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumbled with the keys. The tumbler</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned but an instant before the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guards rammed his shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the barred portal. Paco spat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's face, laughed, and twitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his robe as though the rough cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was again chafing him. The brigand</seg><seg type="columnLine">then leaped into the dividing corridors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried three doors in swift succes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. Only the fourth was locked--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the palace ringing alarm be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him and soldiers wildly trying to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">throw weapons between the steel bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gate, Espadin foiled his comrade</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bent before this door. Thrusting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thin Cordoban blade into the case-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment joint, he found the bolt with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">point and shot it back. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung wide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not for King or Gold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">p^SPADIN had hoped for triumph--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of facing four craven dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">who trembled in their slippers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed the pimples of cold fear through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thin silk of their long and costly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hose. A man looks no better to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman than when vengeance puts ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies in his hands. But the Lozans</seg><seg type="columnLine">were desperate and a coward's cunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a terrible thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alfredo, still hampered by his pinked</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and always stupid, sat as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must when alarm first sounded in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall. Reinaldo, his fat no longer lend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dignity, clutched a bodkin of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress sword in the center of the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was Vicente and the merciless</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dario who held the prisoners. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood beyond the open windows of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room on a balcony, beyond the railing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which the square was far below. Paco</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have leaped at them. Espadin</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed him with a quick hand. Dario</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled thinly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Art wise, Cordoban!" he mocked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But to stand is not enough. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrade has keys which belong to His</seg><seg type="columnLine">Excellency. Hand them over!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paco looked helplessly at Espadin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a hard thing, but Juan nodded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There could be no doubt. Dario and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vicente would not hesitate to fling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl and the old man into space. Paco's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand moved jerkily. Sweating, Rein-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aldo Lozan took the keys and waddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the corridor toward the stair-well</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and the gate. Dario's smile grew wider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved a little and a stirring mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mur rose from beyond the balcony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof that the sullen crowd in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">square could see what happened high</seg><seg type="columnLine">above them and so was watching. Dario</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowled and his lips tightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A hostage is useless when a trap is</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprung," he said softly. "Nombre has</seg><seg type="columnLine">not learned her lessons well. She needs</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger medicine than any we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">given her. Put the old man over first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vicente!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hand of God could not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed Paco then. He lunged forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an animal. Even so, Espadin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto the balcony ahead of him. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was but a moment. Father Montesanto,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had stood with bowed head, sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly straightened and thrust a feeble</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand bravely into Vicente Lozan's face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That gesture of defense saved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bishop of Nombre a terrible death. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed Vicente just long enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paco to reach him. Juan heard Vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cente's breath choke off in a sob as</seg><seg type="columnLine">stout fingers tore deep into his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rosalia de Ardenas was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung from her feet when Espadin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing weight shook her from Dario's</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip. Juan knew only that she fell--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and within the railing. Nothing more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At too close grips to use his long blade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Espadin was put to it to fend off a</seg><seg type="columnLine">poniard in Dario's grasp. And he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">but scantly successful. Razor steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">split his doublet from shoulder to thigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a thin line of welling red was traced</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the bunching muscle exposed un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the rent cloth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Juan had no choice. Before that</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle of death could strike again, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be free of his enemy. Dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rapier, he reached with both hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found purchase. Weight came on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms, his shoulders, his back. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight which rose squirming high in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air and went hurtling out from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A high, thin wail sounded. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an uglier sound from the pavement</seg><seg type="columnLine">far below. And a sudden, exultant</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring as those at hand recognized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed body which had plummeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">down among them. The square, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been nearly silent, rang again with</seg><seg type="columnLine">men moving toward final battle. Father</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montesanto peered over the railing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balcony with a strange look on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Paco yet thrashed purposefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor with Vicente Lozan. Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">padin thought of the fat governor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the keys with which he was unlocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gate to send a flood of guards into this</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. He wheeled--and stood stunned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His rapier was not where he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped it. Its hilt projected at a crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">side angle from the trunk of Alfredo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lozan. The man held a weapon of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own in his hand and stared down at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon which skewered him. To one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, ever so little to one side and close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Lozan, Rosalia de Ardenas stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-faced. But she did not look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alfredo. Her eyes were on Juan Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">padin and the great fear she had felt for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was not yet gone from them. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond believing, Juan understood. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fredo had come at his back. And Pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pita had come between him and death!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">y^LFREDO took a tottering step and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell. Juan caught his blade as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man went down. A single stride carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the hall door to face a tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardsman, plunging in. A parry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">riposte, then Juan stepped aside. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard fell inward and Juan dodged back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to face another. The doorway was deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of a right size for a swordsman to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work one foeman at a time. The guards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken and uncertain, did not think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing up a long-shafted pike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another fell. And another. Blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the planking treacherous. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen bodies hampered Espadin, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought much with his feet. Then a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CASSOCK AND THE SWORD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reached past him, a hand with broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers, and hauled one carcass away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It came back for another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each time there came, after a little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an approving roar from the square be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. Espadin puzzled at this. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacked time to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly it was over. Tumult within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palace reached the stairs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed to the topmost floor. Familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces from the swamp appeared behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guardia in the hall. Swords clat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered to the floor in surrender. Juan</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned back into the room, then. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">single body of the slain remained. Paco</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned, dusting his hands with pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure. The collapse of the guards was</seg><seg type="columnLine">understandable, then. How could men</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight under a rain of their own dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Juanito, my pigeon!" the swamp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">friar of Nombre exulted, "--what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done!

Indirectly the Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can Revolutionary War was to blame for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the late 18th century there were 3 SO crimes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">listed in England which were punishable by hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Women and children were hanged for shop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting a loaf of bread. The British began to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that hanging for petty theft was a serious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake. They then resorted to transporting</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminals out of the country. For a time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">British Treasury benefited from the scheme.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FLOATING HELL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Criminals were sent to the shores of America</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they were sold as slaves to the planters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and $250,000 was added to the government cof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fers annually. But after the American colonies</seg><seg type="columnLine">waged their successful revolution, that market was</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed and the British were forced to look else-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where to dispose of their undesirable countrymen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Penal Settlements of New South Wales were</seg><seg type="columnLine">founded, and the floating torture chambers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought into being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The work of carrying convicts from England</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the settlement was turned over to contractors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They carried on that duty under their govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment's military protection, and they received six</seg><seg type="columnLine">cents per day for each convict's food allowance</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides a tonnage rate. The stories told of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolfish greed of those contractors and the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derous abuse of their task is borne out by recorded</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact. The longer the voyage lasted, the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">money the contractor was able to demand. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the convicts happened to die, he could pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money for their maintenance. Thus a business-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like understanding was established under which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human cargoes died off like rotten sheep. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">report written by Dr. White, the Colonial surgeon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">states that over two-thirds of the convicts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">either dead or dying upon arrival. Many never</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at their destination; they had been over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortured and thrown into the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The typical prison ship, when used as a trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port, carried all the prisoners in two huge cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers. Hundreds of men, women, and children were</seg><seg type="columnLine">chained to one another and to the sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold where they remained for the entire voyage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With hardly any light, very little air, almost no</seg><seg type="columnLine">food, and no provisions for sanitation, it is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder that most of them arrived at their desti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation in a dead or dying condition. According</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the records, at least one hundred and sixty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand convicts were transported from English</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports in this manner while the system lasted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many of the ships were used later as stationary</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisons. The "Success," one of the most notorious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the floating prisons, stood several miles off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast of Australia. In order to completely isolate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "Success" and prevent the escape of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners, a cordon of buoys was moored around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yellow-painted hulk at a distance of seventy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five yards. Any person entering the circle without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proper password and identification was liable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be shot on sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rows of cells were constructed below decks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They looked more like cages for wild beasts than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prison house for men. The massive iron-bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors were fastened with huge iron hasps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy draw-bolts. The "Black Holes," in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">special punishment was meted out to obstinate</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners, were properly named. These stood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corners of the lower deck and can best be</seg><seg type="columnLine">described as small and tapering torture chambers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They measured only two feet eight inches across.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The doors fitted as tightly as valves, excluding all</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, except what could filter through the per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forated iron plate that was placed over the bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the door in order to make the hole as dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">and oppressive as possible. A stout iron ring was</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed about knee-high in the shelving back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cell, and through this ring the right wrist of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoner was passed and then handcuffed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left hand. In this position he could not stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">up straight or lie down, but had to stoop or lean</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the shelving side of the vessel as it rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the motion of the sea.' In every cell on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship the floor was worn into hollows, ruts, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grooves next to each doorway, by the constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">jangling and friction of the prisoner's leg-irons</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they stamped impatiently, waiting for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke of the bell that marked the times for meals</seg><seg type="columnLine">or exercise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although there is not a single case of a success-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful escape on record, riots were of frequent oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">currence on the "Success." Flogging was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">common means of punishment resorted to. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">many as one thousand lashes were ordered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">administered. A "doctor" was always on hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">to time and direct the blows so that a glimmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life might still remain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In addition to the numerous other horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishments practiced upon the "Success" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other prison ships was the "compulsory bath."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten prisoners were scrubbed at once in the large</seg><seg type="columnLine">trough provided for that purpose. Three "well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">behaved" prisoners scrubbed with the aid of long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">handled brushes and the salt water which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made to spray over the bodies of the men. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are ugly tales related of prisoners being brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight from the flogging frame, with their backs</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn and bleeding from the cruel lashes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"cat o' nine tails," so that their wounds could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cleansed by the steady flow of salt water used,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order it was said, to prevent "inflammation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The prison ship is now regarded as a thing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past. The ill-treatment broke the health and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit of would-be good citizens. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of reclaiming a man once the torture</seg><seg type="columnLine">chambers of the prison ships were brought into</seg><seg type="columnLine">play. Men became beasts; their hearts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with hate for the society which had banished</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from all living things. Their sufferings led</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to dwell upon the idea of the only means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of escape--death. It is no wonder that Dr. Ul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lathorne was confronted with a group of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liriously happy men, men who had just been</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed that they were on the way to achieving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peaceful end to all their torment--on the gallows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The year 1870 was the last in which these</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating prisons were used.

Norma Reddick held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to the mystery that had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey to Seattle. She lived just around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner, in the next block, if the cab</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver who had brought Stacey here</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew his directions.

The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung smoothly open, and he strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the lobby of the apartment hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Norma Reddick lived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There had been no difficulty about</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the hospital. The interne had</seg><seg type="columnLine">obligingly called a cab, and after tidying</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself up as best he could in a wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, Stacey had left. Luckily enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contents of his billfold had been left</seg><seg type="columnLine">intact. The map had been the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing taken from him. His luggage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazingly, had not been lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the left of the lobby, opposite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-service elevator, was a small office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A woman night clerk set at a telephone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">switchboard, reading a magazine. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up sharply as Stacey appeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her bespectacled eyes widened at sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his bruised face and bandaged head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd like to see Norma Reddick,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey requested. He gave his name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman glanced disapprovingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a clock on an adjacent wall before</seg><seg type="columnLine">she turned to the switchboard. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost midnight, Stacey saw, hardly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to be calling on anyone--a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady, least of all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman clerk's ring was answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly enough. She spoke into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthpiece a moment, then turned back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Stacey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may go up. The room number</seg><seg type="columnLine">is 506."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stacey's thoughts were grim as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascended in the elevator. It had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten years since he had last seen Norma</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reddick. She was very much an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known quantity. He couldn't be en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely certain that she wasn't connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the two men who, earlier in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening, had waylaid him and robbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him of his half of the map.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stacey already knew that the map led</seg><seg type="columnLine">to something valuable enough to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbery and attempted murder worth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while. He didn't know exactly what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, but Norma Reddick apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">did, if she were able to explain every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to him, as Chinook Vervain had</seg><seg type="columnLine">written. The girl might have decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get Stacey's half. Vervain might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have given her Stacey's Los Angeles</seg><seg type="columnLine">address, as Stacey had been given her's</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Seattle. Thus the girl could very</seg><seg type="columnLine">well be the person behind the Los An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geles attempt. And when that failed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could have prepared the trap at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, knowing, through Vervain again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Stacey was coming to Seattle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It explained very nicely the knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the map and of Stacey's where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abouts possessed by the man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">black Homburg and his companions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey couldn't see how else the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted into the picture and knew as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^JpHE elevator stopped. Stacey</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged with his bags into a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall. Locating room 506, he knocked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door opened after a moment, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealing a girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite himself, Stacey stared. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen lovely women before, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't expected Norma Reddick to fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">into that category. For some inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicable reason, he felt suddenly awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and foolish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl surveyed him cooly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">large, long-lashed brown eyes. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression didn't quite match the tense</seg><seg type="columnLine">set of her piquant, oval features. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore a maroon satin robe about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender figure, and her small feet had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been thrust into furry white mules.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blonde hair the color of ripe wheat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled in thick coils atop her head. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin was delicately tanned, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">freckles Stacey remembered lay like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintest of bronze shadows over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks and the bridge of her small</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose. She had been preparing for bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey decided, or had already been</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep when he arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally Norma Reddick stood aside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Won't you come in?" Her voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft and cool, like her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The living room Stacey entered was</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, simply but comfortably and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastefully furnished. It showed none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usual frills of feminine occupancy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey sat down stiffly, not quite sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, as the girl closed the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded at the sofa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She leaned against the wall near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and looked at him, hands buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pockets of her robe. The ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion which Stacey had earlier noted had</seg><seg type="columnLine">deepened in her face, and now wariness</seg><seg type="columnLine">was apparent, too. Her eyes moved</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over his clothes, and then from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruised jaw to his bandaged head. Sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cey was abruptly, painfully conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the whiskey odor that still hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. The girl said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You claim to be Gregg Stacey. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite possible that you're trying to trick</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. The last time I saw Gregg Stacey</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ten years ago--and in ten years</seg><seg type="columnLine">people can change so much that it isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">too hard for other people to impersonate</seg><seg type="columnLine">them." She paused a moment, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">to note the effect of her words. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're actually Gregg Stacey, suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">you prove it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose you tell me how?"

"You started the game."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well . . . you might have half of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain map, for one thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got me there." Stacey indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated his bandaged head, and explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened, beginning with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">receipt of the map half from Chinook</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vervain, and ending with its loss in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">encounter with the man in the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Homburg and his giant companion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Norma Reddick moved her slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders indifferently.

"You</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't believe me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should I? You still haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved anything one way or another."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Neither have you, for that matter."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey pointed out grimly. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no reason why you should be considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely above suspicion. I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the whole map leads to--some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing valuable, evidently--but you do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You could have decided to steal my</seg><seg type="columnLine">half.

So you could be the person be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the two men who searched my</seg><seg type="columnLine">room in Los Angeles.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too pat," Stacey said.

She tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look serious, though her brown eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed a betraying twinkle. "If it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not too late to apologize, I'd like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stacey watched her unsmilingly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the overhang of his heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows.

I realized that my half of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">map was valueless unless your half</seg><seg type="columnLine">went with it. I wanted to compare</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes with you, to see if any demands</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been made upon you, and what</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew you were to visit me, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause I, too. received a note from Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nook Vervain with my half of the map.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But enclosed was also a letter from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, which explained what the affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all about.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at the floor, not seeing anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lines in his face had deepened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norma resumed, "I learned about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben Stacey's death in my father's let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. It's tied in with the explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the map. You see, several years ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old prospector came into Grubstake</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the story that he had discovered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fabulously rich vein of gold, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the Golden Dream. The pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pector drank himself to death in a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">orgy of celebration before he got around</seg><seg type="columnLine">to doing so much as filing a claim, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was only person who knew the Gol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den Dream's location, and the secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">died with him. Hundreds of men later</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched for the vein, but none ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it--that is, until Ben Stacey did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He and my father had a theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the location of the vein, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned to set out together on a pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting trip. But a few days before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were to start, my father had an ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cident at one of the mines and broke his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankle. Ben Stacey and Chinook set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. They found the vein, all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ben Stacey made a map of the lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation. Then, as he and Chinook were</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their way back, Ben Stacey took</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick. By the time Chinook got him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hospital in Grubstake, it was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late to do anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Before he died, however, Ben Stacey</seg><seg type="columnLine">was delirious and revealed not only that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had rediscovered the Golden Dream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but had drawn a map leading to it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">news spread. Father had the map by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time, and decided to take the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautions I've already mentioned. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered Chinook to go into hiding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since Chinook had been with Ben Sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cey and could have been forced to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the vein was. Chinook thus had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the letter and the map, and was free</seg><seg type="columnLine">to send them on to us in the event that</seg><seg type="columnLine">something happened to father."</seg><seg type="columnLine">QUEST OF THE SPLIT MAP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why didn't your father file a</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim?"

Then I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have tried to find your father. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">most likely being held prisoner some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where near Grubstake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norma said slowly, "I could try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stall Devore off a while longer. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawback is that he now has your half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the map and would refuse to wait. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't do anything that would en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger my father's life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stacey stared morosely into space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnawing at the stem of his pipe. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation was hopeless. If only he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't lost his portion of the map--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruptly Stacey slapped his knee, face</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got it!" he told Norma.

All right, we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him what he wants--but not ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly. Devore doesn't know what your</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of the map looks like. We could</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him a faked map--a map showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a false location for the Golden Dream--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he'd never know the difference.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that's just what we'll do! It'll put</seg><seg type="columnLine">your father out of danger for the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">being, and before Devore finds out he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been tricked, I'll have found Chinook</seg><seg type="columnLine">and filed a claim."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norma was smiling eagerly, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another moment she sobered. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">faked map will have to pass a close in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spection. Devore is certain to compare</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with your half."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll get around that," Stacey said</seg><seg type="columnLine">with assurance. "We'll use paper and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ink as nearly like that of the original as</seg><seg type="columnLine">can possibly be found. And we'll see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it's properly aged by soiling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norma snapped her fingers. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">an all-night drugstore down the street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It has a large stationery department,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but if we can't find exactly what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">want, the manager will get it for us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or for me, rather." Norma grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">wryly. "Just one of my many admirers."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll get started at once," Stacey</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "When we're finished with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">map, I'll check in at a hotel and get</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sleep. In the morning I'll take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane to Juneau. From there, I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to get another to take me to Grub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't seem to be including me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your plans," Norma pointed out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'd better--b e c a u s e I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stacey objected, pointing out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangers that lay ahead. But the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained adamant. Finally Stacey gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. Somehow it wasnt' hard to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TV/CORNING sunlight was warm on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey's face, as he stood watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the entrance to Norma Reddick's</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment hotel from a deeply recessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway on the same side of the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a safe distance away. He puffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatiently at his pipe and wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much longer it would be before De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vore and Buck came out. Almost fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen minutes had passed since the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone into the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stacey's thoughts became worried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Could something have gone wrong?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had Devore discovered at the very out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set that Norma's map half had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">faked?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The possibility was one that Stacey</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't avoid, despite the fact that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Norma had been able to secure</seg><seg type="columnLine">materials closely similar to those used in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the original map, and that Stacey had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked into the small hours of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning over the imitation. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken longer than Stacey had expected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There had been no time for sleep after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. Stacey had checked in at a hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but only long enough to take a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">shower and change his clothes. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd had breakfast and made air reser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vations to Juneau. Restlessness and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nagging anxiety had made him decide to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be present near Norma's apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel when Devore arrived with Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get Norma's map half. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching since the two appeared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While waiting, Stacey had toyed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea of Calling the police to arrest</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devore and Buck, and even of jumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two alone, when they emerged. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had realized, however, that he could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing while Devore held Warren Red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dick in his power. To take any sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">action against Devore at this point</seg><seg type="columnLine">would only doom Norma's father. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, Stacey saw his big advantage lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in keeping himself out of the picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time being. As long as De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vore thought him out of the way, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be able to wage a campaign that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take Devore by surprise right on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his home grounds, without running the</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk that innocent persons would suffer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peering from his doorway vantage</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, Stacey stiffened- as he saw two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men leave the apartment hotel. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no mistaking the pair. Devore and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They seemed highly elated. Stacey</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Devore laugh. Then the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the sidewalk and entered a car</seg><seg type="columnLine">parked at the curb. The machine looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like one rented from a drive-yourself</seg><seg type="columnLine">agency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The car pulled away from the curb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sped off in the opposite direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey watched it dwindle in the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance and finally disappear into an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tersecting street. He felt certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devore wouldn't return. Leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway, he strode toward the apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^^ORMA was busy packing when Sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cey arrived. She grinned excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It worked like a charm!" she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported. "Devore swallowed that fake</seg><seg type="columnLine">map hook. line, and sinker. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">examine it very closely, evidently sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">QUEST OF THE SPLIT MAP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that I'd be too afraid to trick him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was starting to get worried," Sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cey admitted.

"Devore was</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving me a song and dance about how</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried he was over father, and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry he felt that the gang in Alaska</seg><seg type="columnLine">should force me to give up the map this</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. He insisted that he was father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, and that nothing was too good</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the daughter of a friend of his. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so concerned about my future that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he offered me a job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A job!" Stacey snorted. "Doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">what?

It seems Devore</seg><seg type="columnLine">operates a few mines around Gurbstake</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. He named a salary too large</seg><seg type="columnLine">for honorable intentions, and every time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I refused, he raised it. Finally, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he accepted the idea that I wasn't in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested in working for him at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">price, and left."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stacey was thoughtful. "If Devore</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sincere about the job, that means</seg><seg type="columnLine">your father doesn't know Devore is</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for his being kept prisoner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus when your father is released, De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vore will be in the clear. He can file</seg><seg type="columnLine">a claim to the Golden Dream, and no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body can prove anything. Without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">map. neither we nor your father could</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell if it was the Golden Dream or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of a dozen still undiscovered veins</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norma resumed packing, while Sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cey used the phone to send for a cab.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the girl had finished and readied</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself for leaving, they talked while</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for the cab to arrive. Typical</seg><seg type="columnLine">small-talk that did much to relieve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve-gnawing tension which both felt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stacey learned that Norma had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">working as a fashion designer for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large exclusive Seattle dress shop. Al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">most shyly, she revealed her plans for</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening a small shop of her own, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sell clothes which she had designed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finding the conversational gambit in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands at one point, Stacey told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl that he had been taking a post-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graduate course in chemistry at a uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versity in Los Angeles, studies that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been interrupted by two years of war</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty with a chemical warfare division</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Europe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No time at all seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">elapsed, when the clerk downstairs rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">to notify that their cab was waiting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey took the girl's bags, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the room. He'd already had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own luggage sent to the airport.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stacey didn't overlook the possibil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity that Devore and Buck, obviously on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way to Grubstake also, might take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same plane on which he and Norma</seg><seg type="columnLine">had booked passage. At the airport,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave the cab driver a bill, with or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders to check the passenger list on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretext that he was trying to locate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fare who, while enroute to the airport</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier, had left a wallet in his cab.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The driver was also to tour the terminal</seg><seg type="columnLine">building looking for Devore and Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the basis of descriptions which Sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cey supplied.

Stacey remained cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tious, nevertheless, until the plane bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Norma and himself finally took off</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Juneau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trip was uneventful. Yet, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey, it had all the glamor of a flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Moon. How much of this mood</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due to Norma's presence, he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare guess. The girl was intelligent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">humorous, fascinating to talk to. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that they had an astonishingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">large number of outlooks and ideals in</seg><seg type="columnLine">common.</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stacey was startled when the stew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ardess announced that they were short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly to land in Juneau. It seemed im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible that the trip could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made so soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately after landing, Stacey</seg><seg type="columnLine">made inquiries at the air terminal about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next flight to Fairbanks. A plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due to leave in twenty minutes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey was elated. It meant that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time would be lost. He made the nec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">essary arrangements for passage, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, after a quick meal in a restaurant</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjoining the terminal, he and Norma</seg><seg type="columnLine">were once more in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Fairbanks, Stacey found that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">train on the Alaska Railroad would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to Grubstake. The train was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last that day from Seward, and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive in two hours. Stacey didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind the wait. With Norma time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">little if any meaning, and he was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that he had a more than sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">large lead on Devore and Buck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stacey bought tickets, and then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Norma took a seat in the station.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They didn't talk much. By this time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a depth and warmth of understanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them had been reached that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made words superfluous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norma fell asleep, her head resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Stacey's shoulder. After a while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he put his arm around her. He thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his pipe, but filling and lighting it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have required taking his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. He decided that the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sufficiently perfect as it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The train arrived on time. Less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour later, Stacey and Norma were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Grubstake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dilapidated flivver with the word</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxi crudely painted on its sides was</seg><seg type="columnLine">parked at the depot. The driver, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">elderly man whose appearance was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely in keeping with the car, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey and Norma to Grubstake's only</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel. It was after midnight, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive showed the town dark and desert-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. Stacey was grimly glad of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact. His and Norma's arrival couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been timed better, since it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw hardly any notice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hotel was a large frame building</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with asbestos shingles. Stacey</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Norma registered under assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">names according to a prearranged plan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The clerk took them up a broad stair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, to the doors of their respective</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms. He was short and bald, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">protuberant eyes that showed a strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stacey and Norma parted with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberate casualness that left the clerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly disappointed. Once in his room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey lost no time preparing for bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'd had little if any sleep the past few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, and had been going along mainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on reserve energy. Sleep engulfed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a tidal wave as soon as his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the pillow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'"J"'HE sound of someone knocking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his door awakened Stacey. Sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light poured into the room from around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edges of the drawn window shade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gazed about him uncomprehending-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly for a moment, while the knocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">came again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is it?" he called out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's me.

The hotel dining</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was small and pleasantly old-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashioned. He found Norma seated at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corner table. He had hardly sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down when a buxom waitress came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take his order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, here we are," Norma said with</seg><seg type="columnLine">QUEST OF THE SPLIT MAP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grim cheerfulness, when the waitress</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone. "Where do we start first?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The most important thing to do in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning is to find Chinook Ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain," Stacey responded. "Chinook</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows the location of the Golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dream, and with his help we can file a</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim. Devore will be blocked off in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that direction. Then we'll try to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">your father.

He saw that the intimate mood</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they had shared the previous day</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not to be recaptured. To both</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grubstake had become synonymous</seg><seg type="columnLine">with danger, and their presence in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town seemed to cast a shadow over their</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts and emotions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The waitress returned, bringing Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ma's order along with Stacey's.

A pedestrian directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to the offices of the Stacey-Red-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dick Mining Company. Grubstake was</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, and they found that they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily walk the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their objective proved to be a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">single-storied brick building of compar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atively recent construction.

"This is it. Keep your</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers crossed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' ^ 'HEY strode inside. Just within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance was a wooden railing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond which a group of a dozen or so</seg><seg type="columnLine">people sat at work behind desks.

She turned quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strode into one of a group of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">offices, partitioned off from the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room.

Then he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailed its loss in the encounter with De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vore and Buck in Seattle, where he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to see Norma. He outlined De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vore's part in the affair, explaining what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had actually happened to Reddick, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">told of the trick which he and Norma</seg><seg type="columnLine">had used to prevent Devore from ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining Norma's map half.

Well, when I got there, I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin burned down.

He recognized them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. Devore and Buck!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two carried suitcases and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">striding along swiftly and purposefully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had obviously just returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grubstake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cold emptiness spreading through</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, Stacey met Norma's gaze.

Stacey's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightened with sudden decision. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know just how to start. I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow Devore!

Heedless of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's protests, he grabbed his hat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and hurried out to the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T^EVORE and Buck were still in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.

Then Devore strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside, Buck following, and the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed. Lights sprang on behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows in front, but in another mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment shades were drawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crossing the street quickly, Stacey</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped into the dense shadows filling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space between the side of the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and the one next to it. Shades were</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn behind the windows here, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at one of the windows further back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey found the shade hadn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled entirely down to the sill. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the window was on a level</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hi3 chin. He could see without</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty into the room beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devore was standing at a desk a bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">five feet away, his sharp olive face vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible in profile.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">toyed with it a moment, smiling exult-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antly. He said something to Buck, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant's thick lips stretched in a grin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey found, by pressing close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window, that he could hear almost every</seg><seg type="columnLine">word spoken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. . best way to get rich but</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">quick," Devore was saying.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed that Devore's next move,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after locking away the envelope, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be to leave the building with Buck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stacey considered only briefly the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of waiting until the two left and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">tackling the safe in an attempt to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain his half of the map. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been merely a waste of time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was anything but an expert safecracker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving the building quietly and cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously, Stacey strode swiftly back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel.

"I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for you, then.

"I think I have something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say about that, Gregg Stacey!

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of other buildings shortly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came visible in the gloom. These were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlighted. The only sign of life was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shown by particular building upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they were closing in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently their objective was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scant dozen yards away.

Directly under one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps was a table at which two men sat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing cards. They were roughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed and unshaven. Revolvers lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">close at hand on the table before each.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bunks were placed around the sides of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room. In one of these, visible across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table, lay a slim elderly man whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">disheveled sandy hair was streaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gray at the temples. He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Stacey glanced at Norma.

"Mark had a ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute start on us. He told the boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">here that you were coming.

I intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suggest it if you didn't think of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself. Mark and Buck were waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind one of the building outside. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to do was walk in once you had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a fool out of yourself with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty rifle. Both were empty, by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, since I didn't know which one</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd pick.

Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep that monster away from me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devore was unable to hide his gloat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing triumph as he retrieved the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velope and examined its contents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, that's that!

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached Devore in two quick steps, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fist smashed squarely into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A gun went off. Something burned a</seg><seg type="columnLine">furrow along Stacey's shoulder. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck emitted a bellow of rage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed at Stacey wildly. Ducking under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swing of a huge fist, Stacey plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fist into the giant's midriff. Buck re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased a grunt of surprise and pain. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood for a moment as though frozen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flat of one hand pressed against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">injured spot. Stacey swung again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow caught Buck on the jaw and sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">him reeling backward, to crash against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stacey was given no chance to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. One of the two guards had circled</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him, and now the barrel of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's revolver flashed down. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">room went black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DOUGH hands slapped Stacey</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake. The first person he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Haekstrom, who had evidently been</seg><seg type="columnLine">working over him. Stacey sat up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor. Pain flashed and roared in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side his head. His cheeks burned from</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated slaps, and his shoulder was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff and sore where the bullet had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Xorma was seated on the bunk, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father. Her eyes were red and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen.

Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that your're awake, we'll get started."</seg><seg type="columnLine">At an order from Devore, Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled Stacey to his feet. Buck didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to be gentle about it. Great waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of agony battered Stacey, threatening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to engulf him. He clung to awareness</seg><seg type="columnLine">with dogged effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devore crushed out his cigarette and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood erect. He picked up two lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terns that stood, already lighted, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, and handed one to Haekstrom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right, let's go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devore and Haekstrom led the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the building. Buck followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">next, clutching the back of Stacey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket in one hand, and propelling him</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward with repeated jabs of the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver in the other. Norma and Red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dick brought up the rear, forced along</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the two guards. Reddick was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hobble along with the aid of a crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">crutch. He fell several times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The procession wound it way over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley floor, toward a rectangular</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening at the base of a large hill. De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vore and Haekstrom strode into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, their lanterns lighting the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the others in the rear. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed up by a long tunnel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">slanted steadily downward. The air</seg><seg type="columnLine">became clammy and dank as the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent continued. To Stacey, breathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed like inhaling the very at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere of death itself. The thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">made realization of what lay ahead sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly sharp and clear in his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tunnel abruptly broadened out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ending at the brink of a broad chasm</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully twenty feet across. It was a nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">QUEST OF THE SPLIT MAP</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ural pocket in the earth, which the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">made tunnel had intersected. The roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cavern was formed by huge rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">slabs that sagged precariously, pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented from falling only by numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">support beams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devore held his lantern high, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at Haekstrom. "Never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">here before, have you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haekstrom shook his head. A grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing unease showed on his broad face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devore gestured at the crevice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing to worry about. There's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom to this thing. Just take a look."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haekstrom peered cautiously over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the chasm, extending his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern over it. Devore smiled slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and pushed. Haekstrom vanished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He left a scream behind him, a scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed to go on and on, growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">fainter, before is suddenly ended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One less to divide with," Devore</seg><seg type="columnLine">said cheerfully. He looked at Stacey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"See what I have in mind for you? How</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you like the idea?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're mad to think you can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with it," Stacey pointed out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll be missed.

"You'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of feet under the earth, buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">under tons of rock and sand. Anyway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were last seen with Haekstrom--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Haekstrom's dead. No trail lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to me there. Chinook Vervain might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been able to figure things out, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's dead, too." Devore's air of studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">suavity abruptly vanished. His sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">features became set and cruel. "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted enough time on you. The sooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">I get this over with, the better I'll like it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck--over with them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CTACEY felt Buck's great trap-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands close inexorably over him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He heard Norma scream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, with stunning unexpectedness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the repeated, insistent honking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an auto horn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buck gasped, and involuntarily re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased Stacey. Devore stood as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen, staring toward the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The honking came again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Somebody's outside!" Devore</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissed. He whirled to Buck. "Give</seg><seg type="columnLine">me your gun. I'll watch these people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You go with Hank and Matt and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">who's out there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buck obeyed the orders automatic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally. Shortly he disappeared up the tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel with the two guards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devore placed his lantern on a rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">projection and settled down to wait.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He kept licking his lips nervously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing from Stacey to the tunnel en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another moment the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots rang out, striking like sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder into the tense stillness. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled Devore into inattention for just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instant Stacey had been waiting for.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He left the ground in a leap, catching</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devore about the legs. They hit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground in a squirming tangle, a scant</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen feet from the edge of the chasm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once he had recovered from the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise of Stacey's attack, Devore fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a madman. His struggles were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzied struggles of one who has had</seg><seg type="columnLine">victory within his grasp and feels it</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping away. He had dropped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon in falling, his fingers having</seg><seg type="columnLine">splayed instinctively to clutch for sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port. The gun had hit the ground a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few feet short of the crevice.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not be remembered for the good things</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has done; there was nothing of the humani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarian in him. A selfish adventurous soul, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely consumed by one feverish desire, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do what others dared not attempt, to make him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self notorious by his daring. And yet, this com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely self-centered mania which possessed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstrated that even it could be utilized in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery of Truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Richard Burton was an explorer of great, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">unrealized, worth. It was not until years after</seg><seg type="columnLine">his death that the value of his wonderings was</seg><seg type="columnLine">established. He was bom in England in March</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the year 1821. His father, a retired army of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficer, suffered from asthma. Seeking relief from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his suffering, he led his family from one country</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another and returned to England. Young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Richard, as a result, was learning Greek at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">age of three, and Latin at the age of four. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unusually receptive and attentive to all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">languages he heard in those youthful days; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all his life to be a great language-learner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and language-user. They were the means to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloping and satisfying his curiosity, ways of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape from that sense of frustration that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to haunt him all his days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Young Richard was a continual source of worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his parents. His pranks caused him to be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded first as an imp and then as a scoundrel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">thei£ eyes. In Pisa Mt. Vesuvius loomed mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously for him on the horizon. There was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to do but explore it for himself. He wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">content with reaching the crater, for the fumes</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting slow wreathings of smoke far below his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet intrigued him considerably. He had himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered to investigate and, as a result, was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most suffocated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In 1840, though not yet twenty years of age,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was sent to Oxford, to Trinity College, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">company of his brother Edward.

He bought a gun and amused himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the campus with it. He took to rowing, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fencing, to anything but lectures.

Don Miguel turned his gaunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">mount about and saw that yet another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had fallen. The eighth in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. Madre de Dios! thought Miguel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and felt pity in his heart. That he too</seg><seg type="columnLine">might die here in this empty land</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a certainty, yet his heart could</seg><seg type="columnLine">go out to these other wretched humans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw how the foot soldiers--only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two Caballeros were mounted--</seg><seg type="columnLine">straggled in a ragged line. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossbowmen, arquebusiers and swords-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, transported across the seas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now turned into sorry creatures by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert. No longer did the dream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">riches lay in their dulled eyes. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanaticism drove them, as it did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce Don Carlos. But the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearers, who came last, moved steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">under their burdens and were un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched by blazing sun and scorching</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat.

He had a hawkish beak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nose,a cruel traplike mouth. Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlos was one of Coronado's most</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted captains.

For how long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miguel did not know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rJ"'HEY made night camp by a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">arroyo.

It was Mateo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crossbowman, now somewhat re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered from his weakness of mid-day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Something is wrong, Don Miguel?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miguel saw that the soldier had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossbow loaded and ready. He said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing Mateo. Nothing but a snake."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mateo shuddered. "This land is lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the devil," he whispered. "Only hel!</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be so bad. The men are say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Saying what, friend?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mateo hesitated, as though afraid his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words would bring him trouble. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">then: "They are saying that the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">is leading us deeper and deeper across</seg><seg type="columnLine">this barrens, so that we will die terribly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They say he hates all men whose faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">are white. And Don Carlos--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are saying Don Carlos is</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad?" Miguel prompted as the soldier</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke off. "It may well be ... I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk again to my uncle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked through the camp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found Don Carlos still perched upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boulder, like a man enthroned, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now wrapped in his once proud but now</seg><seg type="columnLine">92</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shabby cassock. One thing about Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlos, Miguel realized, was his cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. He had the heart of a lion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he feared nothing on earth. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud and arrogant, and he would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on even though he lost every man of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A lanky, hatchet-faced soldier sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">crosslegged on the ground before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">don. He was the patrol's scribe, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the glow of a fire he was writing</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon parchment with a quill dipped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ink. Don Carlos was dictating in a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, and finally he said, "Now I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">make my mark and affix my seal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quill and parchment were handed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Carlos, and he made his mark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The scribe heated wax, dabbed some</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the parchment, and Don Carlos</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed his signet ring upon the seal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked up at Miguel with a friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile that was a rare thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am making ready for the event of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my death, my nephew," he said. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled the parchment and handed it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miguel. "Should I not live out this</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure, then you shall inherit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">de Hernandez estate in Spain." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his hand as though to halt any</seg><seg type="columnLine">protest Miguel might utter. "No; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be so. You and I, Miguel, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the remain of our family. It is good</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my property should go to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am overwhelmed," said Miguel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet he knew that all that remained to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Carlos' estate was a farm of little</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth. "But what if I do not live,</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You should make some disposal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rich lands you inherited from your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, Miguel," said Don Carlos. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have made such a document as</seg><seg type="columnLine">this one I have given you--in my name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although, you are young and strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">and will surely live to see Spain</seg><seg type="columnLine">again . . ." He looked at Miguel with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bright eyes oddly veiled. "But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a matter for you to decide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miguel nodded. He saw that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wisdom in his uncle. It would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good thing to make sure that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cordova estate did not pass out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">family in the event that he, Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miguel, lost his life. He feared Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlos, yet he respected him. And who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could say that blood was not a strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">tie? Miguel said, "I will sign such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">document, Don Carlos," and so had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribe write out the testament. Unlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">his uncle, Miguel had learned to read</seg><seg type="columnLine">and write. He signed the parchment</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a steady hand, then gave it to Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlos.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we must not die here," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I ask you, my uncle, to turn back be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore it is too late."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The friendliness went out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">older man's manner, and now his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened with quick rage. "I ask no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniveling boy for advice," he all but</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Miguel then knew for a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty that Don Carlos had no real</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubts about the existence of a golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">city called Quivira.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^JpHAT night Miguel nearly died. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">awoke and was .suffocating. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy cloth had been .thrown over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face; it was his own velvet cassock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cassock was held -in place, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smother his breath and his voice, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong hands that were also closed hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his throat. Terror gripped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, and for an instant he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight back. Blackness seeped into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain. His lungs seemed ready to burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">for want of air. But then he managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get a dagger from its sheath and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. He raised the weapon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck blindly. The blade struck against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his assailant's breastplate, and slid off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thrust again and again, trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike flesh. He was squirming, fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, now with a wildness. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throttling hands left his throat. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">VALIANT DUST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of his attacker was lifted from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his weakening body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miguel lay gasping, still feebly strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out with the dagger. But his attack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er was gone, and he was safe ... at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very moment when he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost consciousness. He was too shaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his mind to throw the smothering</seg><seg type="columnLine">cassock from his face, but now that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">choking pressure was gone he could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough air even through the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloth. His throat ached, was swollen</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick, and there was a numbness all</seg><seg type="columnLine">through him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally some of the weakness left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He flung aside the cassock. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sucked in great gulps of air. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night sky, the stars. He pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself up on his elbows and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. The camp seemed asleep in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirety. No lurking figure moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in flight. Men lay sprawled, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving. Miguel looked toward where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Carlos slept . . . His uncle lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest him, not more than ten paces</seg><seg type="columnLine">off; but Miguel could hear the rattly</seg><seg type="columnLine">snore of Don Carlos' breathing, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that he must be asleep. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone had tried to murder him; Mi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guel fiad only to feel of his throat to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that it had not been a mere night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose, reaching for his waterbag.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He drank and his mind seemed to clear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood thinking, knowing ... It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">beeh Don Carlos. The soldiers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing against him, so they had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to want him dead. But that</seg><seg type="columnLine">document he had signed and given to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Carlos! It was reason enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder, to a greed-mad man. Despair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if not hatred, filled the heart of Miguel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He moved toward his uncle, the dagger</seg><seg type="columnLine">still in his hand. He stood over Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlos, a wild desire to kill in him--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a urgent need to get back that docu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment gripping him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Miguel hesitated. He could not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">kill Don Carlos!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shuddered and went back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed-place, but he did not close his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sleep during the remainder of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'I'HE sun climbed into the brassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. Against the desert's distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">rim, a heat haze shimmered in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant waves. The pathetic column</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved on, heading northward once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, driven by Don Carlos' mocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. The morning ration of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been parcelled out; so much for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Carlos, a little less to Don Miguel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cordova, a smaller amount to each</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot soldier, and even less to the In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dians. Tana, the fool, had taken his</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an earthenware bowl and then had</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberately spilled it to the dust. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grinned wolfishly at the watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men, had mocked them. "Agua,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had said. "Water--end of day's</seg><seg type="columnLine">march."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miguel thought of that as he rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">along behind Don Carlos. It had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crazy thing, throwing away water</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was worth all the gold that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to be at Quivira. Or was it</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy? wondered Miguel. It might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Tana was merely baiting the Span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iards on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miguel's horse was dying under him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miguel himself was in bad shape, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps out of the fear forced upon him</seg><seg type="columnLine">by last night's attempt upon his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His throat still hurt, proof enough of</seg><seg type="columnLine">how close a call it had been. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched his uncle, sought guilt in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, but Don Carlos was not a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son to reveal his hidden thoughts. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, Don Carlos said, "Miguel, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are silent this day? Has the desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickness gotten you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They rode side by side, the failing</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses slowed to an uncertain walk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miguel said, "I was nearly murdered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my sleep in the night."</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Murdered?" said Don Carlos, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore a round oath. "My nephew set</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon by a murderer? Who was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackguard? Name him, Miguel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will cut his heart out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miguel had hoped to startle the older</seg><seg type="columnLine">man into some sign of guilt. But Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlos was a fox as well as a lion, and.</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Miguel made no answer, he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"One of the natives, I swear!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miguel's horse stopped, quivering</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every muscle. Its eyes had a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">look. Miguel dismounted, and none</seg><seg type="columnLine">too soon. The animal collapsed, a vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tim of its thirst. Miguel removed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waterbag from the saddle, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing more to salvage. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and found Don Carlos watching him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a thin smile. "Ah, well," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">older man, "you are young and strong."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tana too had stopped to watch. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were malignant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miguel learned the agony of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">afoot on the endless desert. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved the steel greaves from his legs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw them away . . . and later re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved himself of the weight of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breastplate. His helmet he retained</seg><seg type="columnLine">as protection against the sun; he kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">too his sword and his dagger, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier must not abandon his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun climbed overhead, began the</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent westward. The partol lost two</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of its men; they fell and the scant</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of water that could be afforded</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was no help at all. The survivors</seg><seg type="columnLine">complained with despairing mutters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Don Carlos was too much their</seg><seg type="columnLine">master for mutiny to flare. The mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness continued, and now there seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no escape at all. To turn back meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, for now even that chance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rJ''HE sun arced downward, a fiery</seg><seg type="columnLine">red ball at the desert's rim. Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlos called a halt. He was by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle still mounted, and the man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">showed little strain. But then Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlos had had the lion's share of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious water. He called up two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arquebusiers and ordered them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay down their firearms. He pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Tana.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seize the heathen," he ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Indian guide was roughly seized,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Don Carlos said, "Stake him out."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The order was quickly obeyed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indian soon lay spread-eagled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless on the ground. A fire of brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">was built up, a knife blade heated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glowing red. Dismounted now, Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlos received the blade and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Indian. This was a game a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quistador really understood!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A liar and a fool are one," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Carlos.

I, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, can stand no more!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Don Carlos looked up. "Ah?

He would have Mi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guel die, here, now. It was a thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive in the glittering black eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seize this mutineer," ordered Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlos.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The haggard, dull-eyed soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared and were unmoving. A kind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness occasionally given now repaid Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miguel Cordova. Don Carlos saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">here was more mutiny, and he swore</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a great blasphemy. He drew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great sword with a flourish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be my witnesses," he said. "I pun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish a mutineer!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lunged at Miguel, whose armor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had that day been discarded. Miguel</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodged the first deadly blow, then drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own sword. The naked blades</seg><seg type="columnLine">glinted dully in the fading light. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men fought with savage strokes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with lightning thrusts. Don Carlos</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew first blood, a stab to Miguel's left</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. The soldiers made way for them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Indian stared with dull fascina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. The tortured Tana forgot his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own pain to strain in his bounds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch. Miguel's blade glanced off Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlos' armor. He was beaten back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and back. But he could move more</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. And now he swung a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke. The blades clashed, and Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlos' weapon was knocked from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. Miguel held his point to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle's throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T SHOULD kill you," he said, gasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for breath. "But I let you</seg><seg type="columnLine">live because you are of my own blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will harken, Don Carlos--I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking command.

Then he went to Tana.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mateo," he ordered, "release this poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could see that the Indian was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying. Don Carlos' torture had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosened a tongue but it had taken a</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. A sip of water was given to Tana,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he talked to the Indian bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers. He talked long, and the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to jump backward, but he tripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell. Don Carlos bent over him, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">black eyes full of a look of triumph.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the knife blade missed Miguel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat by a scant margin.

Demonstrating a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-placed wariness of the "kind and honest"</seg><seg type="columnLine">widow, Anderson did not bring much money with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to Belle's place. Attracted by Belle's de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scription of herself in one of the marriage papers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anderson made the trip to LaPorte with the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention of matrimony. After the usual amenities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">George was seriously considering returning home</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get what might be termed the entrance fee and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then marrying the woman, but something oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred to make him throw aside these plans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During his stay at the farm he awoke in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night and broke out in a cold sweat at finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself meeting the gaze of Belle who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering intently into his face, a lighted candle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand. What she intended to do, if anything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">George never found out. With a yell he leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of bed, into his clothes, and out the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fast as he could go.

All around the room lay implements</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the butchering profession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stream of suitors continued in 1907 and</seg><seg type="columnLine">1908. Ole Budsberg arrived with $2,000 in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket and Andrew K. Helgelein with $3,000 and</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither has ever been seen since.

Jealousy had made him pack up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his belongings and leave. In LaPorte he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends that Belle owed him back wages. He in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timated that he knew enough about Belle to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">her pay him not only his wages but to keep his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth shut, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lamphere's talking must have frightened Belle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had him arrested on complaint that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane and a menace to the public. Found sane</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the court, he was prompUy released. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble came from another quarter. A letter ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived from Mr. Asle Helgelein wanting to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had become of his brother, Andrew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Belle Gunness was worried. She told an at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torney in LaPorte that she was mortally in fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Roy Lamphere, the ex-hired man. She said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had threatened to kill her and promised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn her house down. With these threats hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over her she wanted to make out her will.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing out of order about the will.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It left her estate to her three children. In case</seg><seg type="columnLine">the children did not survive her, the estate was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go to a Norwegian orphanage in Chicago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the day following the signing of the will,</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmers on the McClung Road saw the Gunness</seg><seg type="columnLine">home in flames. It burned to the ground. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hired man, Joe Maxon, escapcd, and he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he barely made it. Noise of the flames licking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his room had awakened him, be said, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped out his second-story window in his un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derwear. He vowed that just before jumping he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shouted loudly to wake Mrs. Gunness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the children but had received no reply.

On top of them were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charred remains of Belle'* fine upright piano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first move made by the sheriff was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrest Roy Lamphere. A neighbor's boy claimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen Launphere running from the Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness place just before the flames were noticed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lamphere was indicted for murder; and a charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of arson was left hanging over him, just in case</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other charge wasn't sufficient. The victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">named in the murder charge was Mrs. Gunness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But soon people began to wonder whether the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headless body belonged to Mrs. Gunness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those who had seen her, talked with her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">did business with her, were quick to state that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body was too small to be that of Belle Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. Physicians measured the charred remains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the headless woman. Making proper allow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances for the missing head and neck, they con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded that the corpse was that of a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">five feet three inches tall weighing about one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and fifty pounds. Belle, as those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew her agreed, had not been a hair under five</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet seven and weighed at least 180 pounds if</seg><seg type="columnLine">not more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clerks in the town who had sold Mrs. Gunness</seg><seg type="columnLine">various articles of wearing apparel were inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed, and they were able to furnish valuable</seg><seg type="columnLine">information as to her clothing sizes. These fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures were compared with measurements made by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the examining physicians. The two sets of figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated that the body found in the cellar must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be that of someone other than Belle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the baffled authorities busied themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hunt for the head or the skull of the corpse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asle Helgelein appeared on the scene. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brother of Andrew and had come in search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him. He told the sheriff of his fears that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andrew had somehow been done in by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman he had come to marry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A very thorough inspection of the grounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed. The diggers went to work in the high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fenced yard. Under the soft earth they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon rubbish of every sort. Among the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">order of old cans and bottles lay an innocent</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking sack. Andrew's remains were found in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, hacked up but still in a recognizable con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition. Before sun-down that same day, four</seg><seg type="columnLine">more bodies were unearthed. One of these was</seg><seg type="columnLine">identified as Jennie Olson, the girl who had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to California. After the third day of digging in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yard, a total of ten bodies were found. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">many bodies and unrelated parts of skeletons</seg><seg type="columnLine">were found that it was hard to estimate just</seg><seg type="columnLine">how many people had met their end at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunness farm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A rumor grew and spread in LaPorte.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Ira P. Norton, a LaPorte dentist, recalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had done some dental work for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'late" Mrs. Gunness. work which he could easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">identify if found. The problem at this point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Investigation was how to sift the ashes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">debris of a large house and find a few small</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. Louis Schults, a public-spirited citizen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town, heard of the quandary and went to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the officers with a suggestion. He offered to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his talents, acquired in the Yukon as a gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">miner, at their disposal. With some lumber he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could build a regular gold-mine sluice box right</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Belle's place. The Schultz offer was readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted. The sluice was built in Belle's front</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard; water was piped from the barn, and Louis</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to work on the strangest mining job of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">career.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thousands gathered to cheer him on as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoveled tons of debris and washed it down over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the riffles. Newspaper photographers flocked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene. Bets were made on the outcome. Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cago bookies formed pools on the day and hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis would strike "pay dirt." On May 19, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">four days of hard work, Louis came upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of dental bridgework he had been looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">lor. Dr. Norton examined it carefully and pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itively identified the piece as the work he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done for Mrs. Gunness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ray Lamphere, the ex-farm hand, went on trial</seg><seg type="columnLine">in LaPorte for the murder. Acquitted on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge, he was tried for arson and convicted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Obviously the jury did not believe Mrs. Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was dead. Confined in a prison in Mich-</seg><seg type="columnLine">igan City, Lamphere told what he knew to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellmate, Myers. In 1909 when Lamphere died,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Myers repeated the story to prison officials.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Highlights of the account were that despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evidence of the dental work, the body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of a woman Belle had lured from Illinois</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the promise of housework, then killed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beheaded to prevent proper identification. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">head had been destroyed in quicklime. Lamphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed that Belle had killed the four children</seg><seg type="columnLine">one after another, then piled the bodies on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mattress after dressing the woman's corpse in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of her own clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lamphere was sure that Belle had done away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with at least forty-two men getting large amounts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cash varying from $1,000 to $32,000 from each.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Usually she first drugged their coffee, then bashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their heads while they were in a stupor. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">then dissected the bodies on the big table in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellar, tied the parts into neat bundles, and buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in the locked yard. Occasionally she put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bodies into the hog-scalding vat and added</seg><seg type="columnLine">generous amounts of quick-lime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lamphere admitted to Myers that he had helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Belle bury several bodies, but denied he ever had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a part in the actual killing. Although Lamphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">was convinced Belle did not die in the fire, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police have not ever caught up with her. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">people around LaPore believe she is still roving</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a distant part of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The legend of this Female Bluebeard still lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">on and has become a permanent part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">folklore of that region of Indiana.

Sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">it went so fast it looked like it had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment some place, and after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first week we didn't any of us know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what ocean we were in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It kept getting worse. These two</seg><seg type="columnLine">guys with me hadn't ever shipped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">before and they didn't even know the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea was salty. We ran into some rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather one night and most of our food</seg><seg type="columnLine">went overboard because I trusted them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make the stuff fast, and fast was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way it disappeared. What was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't last much longer and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water gave out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TT WAS desperate, I mean to say. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had some poles aboard they wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use for oars, if they knew where to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go and cared to row five hundred miles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I used those poles to knock down</seg><seg type="columnLine">an albatross and once we stunned a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle shark and ate its belly while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail was still kicking. About every</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth or fifth night there'd be a squall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we'd catch rain water in our shirts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pour it into the cans we had. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">every day that South Pacific sun would</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise and bake us crisp before noon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every night we'd shake with chills and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had blisters the size of coffee cups</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over our bodies and barnacles started</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing in our beards.

I hardly got any sleep at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I was afraid of the skinny one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He used to look at me all day and ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">me how much I weighed. After awhile</seg><seg type="columnLine">I figured I was safe because I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">weigh enough any more. So I slept a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little until the other one tried to slide</seg><seg type="columnLine">overboard, and after that I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch him pretty close.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the sixth week started I finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">got ready to tell myself I wasn't going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get saved. I might have dived over</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself but I didn't have the strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand up and I didn't like the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of just rolling off. After that I lost track</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the days and nights, and when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could think a little I tried to figure out</seg><seg type="columnLine">just where we might be, just for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake of thinking about something. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew we were finished but I wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know where. They'd taught me a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about stars in the Boy Scouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'd try to work them out, but every</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I looked at the big dipper I'd think</seg><seg type="columnLine">how nice it would be if it was full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beef stew, and it almost drove me crazy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the day we spotted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sub. It was late afternoon and I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it laying way off against the horizon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">running due south on the surface and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading towards us at an angle. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned my lessons and I knew from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">silhouette that it was an American sub,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a big one at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The closer it came, the crazier we</seg><seg type="columnLine">went.

I was crying like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby half the time and cursing myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for having asked for the Navy when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went for induction, the rest of the time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Navy, I kept yelling, the blankety-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank Navy with its blankety-blank sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its blankety-blank tradition and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chicory in the java and thirteen buttons</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the pants and piping the admiral</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard. I really spoke my mind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, what I mean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then it hit me--the big idea, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean. Why had that sub gone under?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why in the blankety-blank-blank had</seg><seg type="columnLine">it picked just that time to go under?</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was only one answer I could fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure out. It was based on a Navy tra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition about subs. The tradition was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no sub crossed the equator on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You hear that? You understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I'm saying? I figured that sub had</seg><seg type="columnLine">submerged because of the Navy tradi</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion about submerging when it crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the equator. And that meant that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sitting right smack on the equator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I kept looking up at the stars and think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about the equator and suddenly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">let out a yell that was louder than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">nf the yells I'd let out that day, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of 'em had been loud enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill fish in a radius of half a mile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I figured I knew where we were, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at the stars and placing us at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the equator. I got on my knees and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook those two guys with me and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled at them until they understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I was saying. I was telling them</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd figured out a group of islands we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were near, and I grabbed one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">poles and used the flat ends for oars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made them take the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then we rowed. I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how fast we rowed but we had a wake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I don't know how far we rowed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">by morning we saw land. We hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the strength to raise our eyelids</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night before, but hope is what did</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us, and prayer didn't hinder any, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess. When I said I knew there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">land just ahead, they didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough not to believe me, and that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what saved us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"CO DON'T go knocking down tradi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion when I'm around," he said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.

Buzz was puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is an Indian superstition," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rush Randall. "Investigate anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">who knows something about that thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is quite important. Also, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">might keep a lookout for that crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian.

She said, "Where is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rush Randall going?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz shrugged. "We have no idea,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, we can't even guess," said Dea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">con. looking gloomy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If they had only known, they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been convinced that Rush Ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dall had no idea, either.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EITHER would they have recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized their leader and partner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Skin stain and pieces of paraffin in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted inside his cheeks had changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rush's character. He now had dark,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">leathery features and a limp. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoop-shouldered. He looked like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old codger who might have spent most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his life in the Maine backwoods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The instructions for meeting those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who knew about the Indian thing men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ace--turned over to Rush by Judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">English--had been quite specific. Rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to take the noon ferry from 125th</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street, cross to Fort Lee, and enroute</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch for a man on board who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be wearing a derby and whistling "Mex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icale Rose." He was to follow this per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son from the ferry on the Jersey side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get into the car which the man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the derby hat approached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The contact was made, and "Derby</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hat" was a big, powerful fellow with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunburned features and wedge-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. There were three other men</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting in the car on the Jersey shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rush, limping a little and bent over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed into the car, and the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">started up and they went away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in quite a hurry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the individuals in the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">were browned and husky-looking. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver seemed to be in charge. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out turning his head as he sent the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing the long hill up out of town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "You have the money?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rush, speaking with a slight twang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "Reckon as I have. Check."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A check?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yep.

Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, that plan is okay with us, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think. We'll take this old geezer out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He continued driving at a fairly good</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And some time before one o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">that afternoon, they arrived at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, private airport in the Jersey hills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The big silver plane was waiting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, and Rush, as the old man, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken aboard. A few moments later</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane took the air, circled the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice so the pilot could mke certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one had followed and then headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two men came into the cabin where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doc was seated. One said, "Pop, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotta get a treatment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Treatment?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yeah. We 're gonna give you a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot. It won't hurt you any. You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">just sleep the rest of the way. You see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we ain't taking no chances on you find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out where we're taking you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old fellow seemed to think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">over for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wal, I reckon I'll have to take it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said finally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They gave Rush the kind of an injec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion they had administered to Judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon, Rush was stretched out limply</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on a bunk that had been installed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of some of the cabin seats. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">snored loudly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the passengers grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Won't that old boy be surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he wakes up?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess so!" agreed his partner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rush Randall listened to the remarks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to decide whether the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still heading north or not. Later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the men should step into the cockpit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might be able to find out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^T FIRST, the drug reaction in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">system was terrific. For the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jection that Rush had taken earlier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an antidote for the hypodermic given</seg><seg type="columnLine">him aboard the plane, was now counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting effects of that hypo. Rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought off the strange sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Judge English had told him of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">injection which kept him asleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the journey to the mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous hideout. So Rush Randall had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been prepared for the same thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not "asleep" now. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was quite wide awake, as a result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one drug trying to overcome the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his system. It was his splendid phy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sical condition that finally won out. Ho</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained awake--though to anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">who might have closely examined him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he appeared to be a person in deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He listened carefully, careful not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make any movement, and after awhile</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was certain that the plane was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men came into the cabin at intervals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They discussed the flight. Rush lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A day and a night passed, and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time early in the morning the big ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down and landed on the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch of hard-packed sand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a beach bordering a river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All around the isolated region, heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">foliage was everywhere. A dark forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grew to the water's edge, excepting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strip of beach, and this forest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stately trees slowly mounted upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">into mountains that lay beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the entire thing, the green for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ests, the mountains, even the cloud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">studded sky was reflected in the flat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth water like something done in</seg><seg type="columnLine">oils. The air was motionless and warm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great silence everywhere was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat breath-taking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rush Randall was removed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, laid down on the beach, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussion followed as to just how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big fellow was to be carried. Nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to relish the job.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the men were talking about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, a man appeared along the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">that led out of the deep forest, hailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and came down the beach to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Someone said, "It's Mort. He'll tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">us what to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A/TORT, it turned out, was a thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trim man with cool gray eyes. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared he had arrived from some</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp located not far from the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said now, "We're not taking this</seg><seg type="columnLine">old guy up to the camp."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rush knew that Mort was referring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself. Through slitted lids, Rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">had obtained one quick glimpse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, but he dared not look again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Someone might see the movement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyelids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?" one of the men from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because we've moved Howard Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Moved him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah. We think maybe his father</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have figured out something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe he guessed the location. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've sent him up to the passage. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you'll take this contact man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean," someone said in sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise,"up to the Crazy Indian?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There seemed to be some doubt in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men's minds about making the trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Crazy Indian at this time; this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more of a feeling that Rush sensed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than hearing any actual words</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Howard English," continued the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man named Mort, "is at the Passage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It'll take you about two days. We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got things all ready and waiting for you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So you'd better get started."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rush Randall, listening, continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assume his sleeping, unconscious atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude. He had planned a break when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane flight was ended, but that plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was swiftly changed now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For he had an idea, now, where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. The plane had not flown north.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The comments about the direction the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane was flying were made simply for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his benefit, before they thought he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been knocked out by the drug. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wanted him to believe the hideout</seg><seg type="columnLine">was somewhere north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rush guessed it was South America.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had flown too long to make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panama or Central America, though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, what he had seen of it, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thick jungle growth all around</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, the odor of tropical foliage, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet motionless warmth told him these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. And something else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The girl had mentioned South</seg><seg type="columnLine">America when she told Rush and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">partners about Mike, the strange-act-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Indian who was supposed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a hundred years old. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">all three men who had so mysteriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped from sight--Jordon Marsh;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's uncle, Clarence Hobart;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judge English--all of them, according</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the girl, had been associated in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">way or another. There was her com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment about a project the three wealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had been interested in down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Florida. Somewhere, Mike, the In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CRAZY INDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">125</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dian, was tied in with that too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now Judge English's son, How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard. had been apparently abducted also.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where did he fit into the mystery?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, it looked as if Rush was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">lo find out. They were going to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">him inland, from the comments he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard, to the spot where they were hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Howard English. Where was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crazy Indian, and just what was it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">They spoke of it as if it were an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">animate thing. Odd!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mort was saying, "You guys will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">met by the chief when you get up</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. He's got some other stuff lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Someone whistled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were exclamations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the undercurrent of tenseness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Rush Randall quickly sensed, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew a reference had been made to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">real brains behind the mystery. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in this vast jungle of space was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Would he live to return to the "out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side" again, or to get word to his asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciates? He wondered if, for once, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had carried this thrill for adventure just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little too far.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were getting ready to start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">J^N IMPROVISED rack was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed, and his big, hard-muscled</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame was tied securely to that. Rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">still pretended deep slumber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trek through the forest lasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">several hours. The heat was not un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearable, for the thick green foliage</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut out practically all sunlight, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was moist and humid in the shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the trees. There was the heavy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet smell of wild orchids, growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">atop the tall trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They reached another, smaller river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was transferred to a boat. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large affair made of stout saplings and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">logs. There was a cabin of sorts, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls laced with heavy matlike material</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was was as secure as the bars of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prison. Light came through tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracks in the latticed material.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was placed inside, still tied hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and foot, and a door was latched se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curely. The trip continued, men poling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wide, flat craft downstream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another day passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rush knew that two men stood guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the cabin. He had heard them</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking from time to time. Mort, ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously, was taking no chances--though</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone still believed Rush Randall to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be under the influence of the sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">drug.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Night came again, and some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">after dark the boat stopped. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy silence for a while, and then ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tivity began. Rush listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard men talking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Someone came into the dark cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he lay motionless on the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor.

The man straightened with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object in his hands, and he yelled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back you guys! Out of the way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those who had not been knocked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell swiftly away from Rush Randall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the giant Indian.

To remain there and face the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine-gunner would mean certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so they plunged down a steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">path that led back the way they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached the lookout point.

But the gunner was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cited. His aim was faulty. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he got the deadly weapon under</seg><seg type="columnLine">control, forcing it downward for better</seg><seg type="columnLine">aim, Rush and the Indian had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the protection of the trees downtrail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon they were completely hidden in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gun, though, continued to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">out blasts at intervals.

Half running, half</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog-trotting, Rush Randall had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard put to conserve every ounce of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. Several times they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped at fresh water springs, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rush had flung himself down to gulp</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cool water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His entire body had been feverish</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of the lack of water and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects of the drugs.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He circled again, throttled back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gas and went into the approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">glide.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down and taxied slowly along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, eyes watching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz spotted the trail opening into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy forest. "That looks like it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pointed out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came up to the tiny point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and killed the engines.

The plane, floats</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely drawing six inches of water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was easy to handle. They guided it</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CRAZY INDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">down along the shore until they reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curtain of trees that hung, veil-like,</seg><seg type="columnLine">down over the water like weeping wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows. They concealed the plane as best</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They removed distributor parts from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engines, locked the cabin.

And there's plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivers in this country. The Crazy In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian, Rush said, is a boat. It isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">there." He removed one of the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">maps from his pocket and made nota-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. "Perhaps we can locate it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. They've probably moved it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least, now we know where it's sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to be!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They started the trek back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz cursed the humidity. The air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thickly wet, and gave the impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of coolness beneath the closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing, tangled trees. Nevertheless</seg><seg type="columnLine">both men were streaming with perspira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion as the afternoon wore on. Buzz</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stripped down to the waist now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his sweaty body looked like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinny shaft wound with steel bands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The afternoon was waning when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the river again. Their first</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought was of the plane. If someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard them land this morning . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they found the ship secure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">intact. They had just completed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick inspection when both heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. They listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a gasoline engine, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine was on a boat somewhere on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, for it came down there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Coming this way!" exclaimed Buzz.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shortly the boat appeared. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old gas boat with a small cabin built</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its deck. As the boat approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">they made out the figure of a man at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wheel. Buzz yelled before Deacon</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stop him. Regardless, the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spotted the plane concealed beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz said, "Golly! He's an Indian! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man at the wheel was a tall, big</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with coppery features and heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight black hair. His features were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very sharp and very grim-looking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They noted these things as the motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the boat was silenced and the craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted slowly toward them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">waded out into the water and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boat was almost up to them now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's bow gently scraped the bottom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indian turned and said something</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another person who must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was some sort of muffled an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer, and next the girl appeared ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruptly on deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl, as pretty as ever, was Lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"DUZZ was excited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But Deacon murmured sourly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Trouble! I see it coming!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Disregarding his remark, Buzz</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled aboard the craft. He grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's slim, straight shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gosh!" he said. And then, "Gosh!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're all right, huh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deacon had followed with some mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, I'm all right, Buzz," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. She smiled at Deacon. She in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicated the tall, wiry Indian. "This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe. He has a name a mile long, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I call him Joe for short. He's one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best guides in this country."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How'd you pick him up?" Buzz</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to know. "And how'd you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">down here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled again. Her eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue now in the fading sunlight. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew one of the regular airlines, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">chartered a pilot to bring me to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">little village from where Rush Randall</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent the telegram. I picked Joe up</seg><seg type="columnLine">there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Deacon who asked, "Have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to locate Rush or any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others yet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lucky Williams shook her head. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely eyes clouded. "I'm worried,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said tautly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We go now," said Joe, the guide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deacon looked at the girl instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guide. "What's he talking about?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Go where?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He knows of a camp upriver. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me Jordon Marsh built it several</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago. He thinks it might be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best place to start the search."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deacon thought that over a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right," he agreed. "We'll use the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the guide shook his head. "Place</seg><seg type="columnLine">we go, river too narrow," he said with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out expression. "Only go by boat."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deacon frowned, looking at the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can this guy be trusted?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Absolutely," she said quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tall, lanky man shrugged. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I guess we can't be any worse off!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Obtaining some additional food sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies from the plane, they set out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The river grew narrower. The for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ests closed in around them as dusk</seg><seg type="columnLine">neared. The solitude was tremendous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only disturbed by the steady throb of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CRAZY INDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat engine which echoed far up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down the inland waterway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was dark when the guide put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft into shore again. Deacon held a</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful flashlight. All saw the float</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of heavy logs, and which served</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a landing point. The raft was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chored to the shore line by heavy chains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went ashore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">guzz was particularly solicitous</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the girl. But she was first off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat, first to have a small pack sack</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on her shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said impatiently, "We'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry. Joe told me the camp is a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">from here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had brought additional lanterns</seg><seg type="columnLine">as part of their equipment. Deacon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had little to say to the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, as far as Buzz Casey was</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned, she was tops. She had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained to his satisfaction why she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">so abruptly disappeared from New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe, the guide, saying nothing, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws occasionally working on a wad of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobacco, led the way through the woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everywhere there was the vast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange silence, as though the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world were waiting for something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen in the next moment. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncanny. What menace lay ahead in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deep interior of this vast country?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This feeling grew upon them as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">plodded beneath the trees. The spongy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly damp ground muffled their</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, and about the only sound was</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they spoke to one another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz said abruptly, "I was just think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tall Deacon was behind his partner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl between them as they walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">single file.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deacon said sourly, "Don't flatter</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Disregarding the comment, Buzz</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, "I was thinking what a heck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of a spot we'd be in if this guide walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on us." He waved his arm indicat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the impenetrable forest that com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely surrounded them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up! " said Deacon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl gave a soft laugh. "Buzz,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said, "you're worrying needlessly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe is dependable. He's a wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope so," said Buzz.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They abruptly emerged in a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing, and there before them was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whoever had built the cabin should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been given credit. It was well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">made, heavy logs forming its sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl pointed ahead and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, "There's someone herel</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's a light."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They all hurried forward toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway of the building. But suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guide spoke in a voice that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of a soft hiss than anything else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wait!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz gave the Indian one of his bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligerent looks. "Wait for what?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guide had turned, was motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the others to crouch down. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed behind them, toward the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods from which they'd barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" he said very quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They all stared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz, impatient as always, started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutter, "What the blazes . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he paused, his small eyes blink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. All of them saw now as their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated on the darkness beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dark forms were moving out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees. Those near the cabin were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being surrounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moving forms were men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HpHE guide made a deep sound that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sounded like a grunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trap!" he announced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">14U</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz shot a look in the general direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion where the guide was also crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in the darkness. "Yeah," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed. "And heap big!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They could perceive several dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms advancing swiftly across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deacon was the first to act. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped to the door of the cabin, pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep out of sight!" he ordered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's going to be a little trouble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm afraid!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz had dropped his pack, was ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vancing across the clearing. His bright,</seg><seg type="columnLine">small eyes gleamed and his fists knotted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll say there's gonna be trouble!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he yelled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was first to meet the circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing assailants. Deacon and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide were quickly at his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fists swung. Men yelled in a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue. Bones cracked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was enough night light in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing around the cabin to show the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving of figures. Buzz banged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through several of them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dark-skinned natives. They be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came confused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz was shouting now, making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">racket. He grinned every time a figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down beneath his flailing fists.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deacon was busy with his fists, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to handle a couple of natives at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. The natives appeared to be un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed, so the two partners hesitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">at using guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe, the guide, seemed to be doing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">share of fighting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deacon, seeing his small partner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">predicament, worked out a little system.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He picked up a man, whirled around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and around with him until the fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dizzy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gering backward like a drunk looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a place to light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz was waiting. He held his .45</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the barrel. He tapped the dazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">native with the gun butt as the fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered past him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They tried the same method with</seg><seg type="columnLine">another victim. It worked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three men leaped on scrappy Buzz</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casey--and this time Deacon hit Buzz</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a gun.

But that didn't help</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buzz Casey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fell flat on his face . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Buzz swayed to his feet, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that the fight had worked its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">around to the rear of the cabin. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was some commotion back there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he leaped that way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it wasn't a fight.

The man went stag- said nothing. For once, Buzz was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CRAZY INDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">141</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">joking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Around them there was the dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep solitude of the forest, more omi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nous than ever. Nothing stirred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz finally said, "Bet you those guys</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured the girl knows something. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">why she was seized."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deacon's features were grim. "Has</seg><seg type="columnLine">it occurred to you," he demanded, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she might have arranged this trap?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently it had not, for Buzz</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked surprised at mention of the idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't believe it!" he exploded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deacon said, "She's in trouble.

"It</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks like some menace threatens that</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire crowd!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz still didn't look convinced. Aft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er some arguing, it was decided, finally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that perhaps they'd better try and trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl. She might be in danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They spent a few moments locating</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that had been lost in the fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally they got started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beginning of the trail led along</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fairly well-defined path through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big woods. Men--or possibly animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">--had made the trail. It skirted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicker undergrowth. Walking was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">too difficult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They continued onward for about an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. They found no signs of the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or of the guide, or of anyone else for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trail had narrowed now, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more than a narrow pathway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They came to a fork.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since the left branch of the fork</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be the main route, they fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed this. Naturally they first searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">for footprints. But a heavy carpet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">old leaves that lay on the ground gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">no clues.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And there were more forks in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">skimpy trail beneath the dense trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at each of these points the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and argued. Argued about</seg><seg type="columnLine">which trail to follow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For another hour they kept boring</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper into the heavy forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally Buzz drew up short and said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think we took the wrong turn at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">last fork. Better go back." He pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. There was nothing but a wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trees now. "I think we made a mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They returned, watching for the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">fork where they had turned off.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned again--to find that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow missed the trail they'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz blinked his eyes.

Quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had the craft in the water, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and the girl were aboard. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">handled a paddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The canoe slid out into the water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed downstream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rush said.

It was around one of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">bends that the canoe had disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, and when Rush and his friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">again caught sight of it--they stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">short.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For Rush saw the amphibian plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn up close to the shore, practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealed from the river by low-hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tree branches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mike turned, asked, "Others being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rush nodded, his features thoughtful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mike started forward again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait!"

Who?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Howard English, though he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall, very capable-looking man, started</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stammered, "I . . .

Strangely, though, Rush made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no mention of that fact now, or that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had played the part of the contact man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said, "Perhaps the guide, here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">can help us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They all looked at the man named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe, whose name the girl had mentioned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been listening to the conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion his lean hard paws working on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobacco cud from time to time.

But one of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarding the raft made a mistake. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">got too close to Buzz Casey.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped into the midst of the men.

They carried guns in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">packs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fight, a tight, furiously moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, swayed back and forth across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raft. The yacht pulled away, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">off as a battle took place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz slugged one fellow, dumped him</seg><seg type="columnLine">overboard as though he were an empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sack. He grabbed another. He managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to twist one of the clubs out of the fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low's hand. He hit the man a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack, saw him sway crazily. Buzz</seg><seg type="columnLine">booted him and knocked him into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. He leaped back into the melee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the club swinging, heads cracking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deacon was trying to hold his own on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite end of the raft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both partners were so busy fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had not noticed something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the raft. But Deacon got a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">view now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ahead, the river divided into two</seg><seg type="columnLine">channels where it passed a heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooded island, that lay right in mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. The raft was doing a crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle in the river currents, swinging to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left of the island. But it was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to shore, moving swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deacon had already eliminated sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral assailants. All were in the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swimming, being carried downstream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three others were picking themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">up dazedly from the float, and looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat amazed.

And then, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild yells, they ran back along the float</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dived into the river. They had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The yacht, meanwhile, had held</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, its pilot apparently afraid to ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture too close to shore. And for good</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly a submerged rock hooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forward end of the moving raft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed it, and suddenly the huge float</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiveled in the swift current and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half circle, its forward end still</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed. Then the raft slammed against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river bank, pushing up beneath low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging branches that hung down al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most to the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Someone was shouting from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht, still out in midstream. A small</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat was being lowered over the side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aid was being sent to those struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment, Buzz and Deacon</seg><seg type="columnLine">were screened from those remaining on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yacht. The raft was still stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the jamming rocks. It was half</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden beneath the overhanging trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz yelled, "We'd better hurry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was ripping at a draw string on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pack sack. Shortly, he had one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pistols in his fist. Breaking the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, he removed the shells and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiping them with his shirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deacon located one of the guns in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sack and started doing likewise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz grumbled, "Hope these blasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">things still work!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They got the guns ready, crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">down near the back of the raft, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for the attack that they knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soon to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before that happened, they heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screaming of the girl and the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nerve-wracking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JDUZZ, screened by the branches, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been standing with one of the pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tols held ready in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking a desperate chance, he ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">out along that part of the log raft which</seg><seg type="columnLine">still protruded into the river. The small</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat had just returned to the yacht,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was loaded with men rescued</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the river. But on the deck of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht itself, another form of activity</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taking place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were two men struggling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone. Buzz stared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a girl!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sunlight touching the red-gold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's hair! He gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lucky Williams!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And she was struggling with men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">held her captive aboard the sleek-look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing yacht!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz gave a yell. He raised the pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol and fired a blast over the yacht.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out!" Deacon warned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Guns blasted from the yacht.

It was either that--or get</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The siege of the island took place</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the remainder of the day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each time one of them ventured out</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto the log float, to note what was hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pening aboard the yacht, there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattle of gunfire and he was forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreat to the island again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The yacht, Deisels throbbing as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">held steady against the downriver cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent, lay two hundred yards off-shore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The yacht could not come closer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">this because of rocks which surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither did the small boat put out</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the island.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded like there was some kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. Clearly across the water, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear men pounding along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck, shouting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then there was the girl's cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. A cry of terror!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz, out on the raft now with Dea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">con, squinted his gaze as he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see across the water.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">half hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he heard underbrush crack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling, and then Buzz, water still dripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him, appeared from behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Worked my way back to shore at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other end of the island!" he said.

"You don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think she reached shore?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz shook his head.

"We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">never make the mainland."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They spent an hour trying to pry the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big log float loose. They used the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">poles that had already been on the float,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they located pieces of heavy drift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood along the shore. Using pieces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the driftwood as fulcrums, they pried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raft slowly off the rocks. It finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">came loose and started easing away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shore. They jumped aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon had come up now. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">around them was the night, white and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, and in the distance the dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somber fringes of the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buzz said, "We're in one hell of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fix now if that yacht comes back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He still held one of the pistols.

At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy's request, his father had purchased a</seg><seg type="columnLine">commission for him in the East India Company's</seg><seg type="columnLine">private army which still governed India. He em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked, endured the boring days of heat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stench and monotony on the journey around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cape, and landed in India on the 28th of October,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1842. Ambitious, he set about learning the lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guages, manners, customs, of the peoples of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">East. Very unpopular among his fellow officers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came home on furlough bearing the nickname</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stuck throughout the rest of his life--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ruffian Dick. He had been over-bearing, brutal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unmannerly. But what alienated his fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">countrymen the most was his queer behavior</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the natives. In his free time he was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways to be found wandering in the native bazaars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more often than not himself in the garb of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">native, unclean, and unashamed. He had even</seg><seg type="columnLine">been admitted to the native order of mystics as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Master-Sufi; he was an atheist; and, very prop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erly, he had been forbidden active service.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At home on a long furlough, he responded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the urge to write and put down his thoughts on</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper.

Burton won a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hearts of the Mohammedans for himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">by using his scant knowledge of medicine to good</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">set them before us and a couple of side</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishes of potatoes and vegetables, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know whether that's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">broiled like you want it.

I imagined he was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way in everything he did. Nothing ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be left to chance. The kind of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was meant to be an auditor, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk in some lawyer's office. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him drawing up briefs, meticulously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefs like traps, from which there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no loopholes of escape. Everything in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its place and a place for everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We got back to Sorensen, after our</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know many of the men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">work there?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," I said, "there's about six</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred working the three shifts.

It was certain death</seg><seg type="columnLine">if his true identity as an unbeliever should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered. His remarkable linguistic ability stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in good stead. Quiet and unpretentious, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew little attention from the rest. But always his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark eyes darted to and fro taking mental notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the future, so that the outer world, the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the West, might someday know what they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only been able to guess at for so many years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Were the stories true that told about the fabulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">riches of Mecca? What did the mysterious rites</seg><seg type="columnLine">consist of? Burton was bent on finding out. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, shining white and dirty in the sunlight, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mecca. Burton's heart rose high at the sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he was called upon to exercise even greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">skill in imitating the actions of the others, utilizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the patience at his command to maintain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">character of a pilgrim. He had to live the Arab</seg><seg type="columnLine">as completely as it was possible for any alien to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. And he seems to have done it very completely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There followed days of pilgrimage to this and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that site throughout the Holy City, culminating</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the visit to the Kaaba, that centre of Islam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">older than Islam itself, with the sacred black</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone much be-kissed by the crowding pilgrims.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burton, when it came his turn, knelt and kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an equal piety but a sharp eye. He noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the texture and appearance of the stone, decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was an aerolite, stored the fact away in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind for future use, and passed on with pray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lips and hooded eyes. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strain on Burton was very great. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunted by the thought that some night, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, his veil would slip aside, and he would be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tray by alien gesture or motion that un-Islamic</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul of his. Then the caravan gathered and Mecca</seg><seg type="columnLine">became once more a mere speck on the horizon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burton reached the British consulate on the coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different man. Memories of little indignities and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discomforts he had to bear preyed upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensitive mind until outwardly in every respect</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was likened to the Ruffian Dick people had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dubbed him. The account he later published of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his exploit in penetrating Arabia cast off the veil</seg><seg type="columnLine">RUFFIAN DICK: EXPLORER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of darkness that had hung over it for so long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back in service in India, he was selected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">undertake a new venture, this time in the interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the East India Company. For some time thc</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian Government had toyed with the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exploration of Eastern Africa, particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somaliland. They wished to know the population</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the region, the habits and appearances of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, the exact location of the forbidden city of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harar, far inland. Burton's proposal was that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">be landed on the East African shore, with suitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">provisions and money, in the company of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. The expedition would set out across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, visit mysterious Harar, pass on to Gan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anah, and so reach Zanzibar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without delving into the actual day-by-day</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of the incidents which befell the group,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is enough to say that the venture was a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete success from the standpoint of knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained. On the other hand, the sufferings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardships of the trail from raiding bands of rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers, from dangerous animals which lurked nearby</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the night, dysentery and fever, made the effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">call for a very rare brand of heroism. Burton</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned home with scars. A Somali had thrust a</seg><seg type="columnLine">javelin into the explorer's mouth, lacerating his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips and cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Resting in England he wrote his "First Foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps in East Africa." Burton's now peaceful and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placid existence got on his nerves, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to be off again. The Arundel family still</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded him as an unfit son-in-law and advised</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to make an attempt at success in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">profession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Crimean War was now being waged. Burton</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed for the Crimea on his own responsibility.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There he joined Beaton's Irregulars, became adju-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant. drew up elaborate plans for new modes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavalry attack and general tactics, and impatiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited in vain. The war dragged on, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">now a war of siege and sortie and repulse, hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing little or no need for gay irregulars in cavalry</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform. Burton sank to quick despondency . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as he dreamed of what he might be doing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts drifted to Africa again and the pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibilities of another expedition, this time to seek</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the sources of the Nile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back in England after the war, Burton laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plans before the Royal Geographical Society.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remembering his joumey to Harar and also the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news of Livingstone's discoveries in the southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of Central Africa, Burton's plan interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The primary object of the expedition would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be to ascertain the limits of the Sea of Ujiji--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great sheet of water of which rumor had travelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the East Coast. He was also to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigate the exportable produce of the interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ethnography of its tribes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a grant of 1,000 pounds and Speke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompany him, Burton set out on his fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey into unknown regions.

A thorough study</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was made of every aspect of the island and its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">people. This took several months and it was not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">until June of the next year that the expedition</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">headed into the interior. Burton was the first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white man to look upon Lake Tanganyika.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Burton set about to plan for a thorough ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ploration of the lake region. Too ill to move he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">called Speke to him and laid before him a tenta-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tive plan. Speke agreed to take half the caravan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and set out on the mission. When Speke later</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rejoined Burton he had vague news to tell of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great lake he discovered. Burton became disgusted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the roundabout replies he received to his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">queries and gave up. The caravan set out for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  While Burton lay ill in the hospital, Speke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hurried to England. He published an account of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the expedition, stressing his own discovery of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lake he named Victoria Nyanza, made no mention</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Burton, and affirmed his opinion that the Nile</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rose in the Victoria Nyanza. He was greeted with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great acclaim, honored everywhere, and funds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were raised to equip a new expedition under his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">command. Burton arrived in England to find him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self robbed of his fame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At this time Richard Burton faded from public</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">view. He wrote bitter articles against Speke which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were not widely read, and then looked about for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">something to do. Voyaging to America he spent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some time with the Mormons. He returned to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">write the usual book and to marry Isabel Arundel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">To the end of his days, he moved from one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">foreign and distant shore to another. Appointed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">counsel to Fernand Po, then Brazil, Damascus,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Trieste, his curiosity for new places was only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">partly satisfied. When well over fifty he rode out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in search of the Gold Mines of Midian from Da-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mascus, spent a vigorous holiday in Iceland, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">continued writing manuscript after manuscript.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Finally, between 1885 and 1888 he set to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">translating of a completely literal English version</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the "Arabian Nights." The translation was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very well received, and Burton was now a rich</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DECEMBER 1946</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SCIENCE COMICS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Now available.
