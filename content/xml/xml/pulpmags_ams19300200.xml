O'Conor Sloane, Ph.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IF we cut a circle out of paper or piece of wood, we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is called a disc. Of course, the minute a disc becomes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any thickness it may be classed as a cylinder, but for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes we will call anything circular in shape and width</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with parallel sides a disc, no matter how thick it is. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be curious to see what an enormously important part the disc</seg><seg type="columnLine">plays in this world of ours. Presumably, the first method of</seg><seg type="columnLine">transporting goods over the surface of the earth was with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sled, which had to be dragged along. In going a mile, a person</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to overcome or contend with one mile of friction. To reduce</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amount of friction, a pair of discs were taken, holes bored</seg><seg type="columnLine">through their centers, mounted on an axle, thus forming the basis</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a cart. Here the mileage friction was reduced to a few feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to the relation of the circumference of the axle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circumference of the disc, which we will now call a wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And this utterly improved mechanism, the wheel and axle, has</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved to be one of the most important things in all this world</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ours. The vehicles which crowd our streets, so that it is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem how the pedestrian can get across, all go upon wheels;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thousands and thousands of miles of railroad all go upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels, and the enormous business which has been done in Wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street is based largely on wheels, because not only railroads</seg><seg type="columnLine">but manufacturing concerns, every business that uses machinery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is dependent upon wheels--upon our disc. In the^ days that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Homer tells of, the chariot, carrying a warrior with his aide, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a most important element in the army. The poet describes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting together of a war chariot in preparation for the battle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing what a wonderfully light, trivial structure it was. As it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no springs, the wonder is how it could keep together or why</seg><seg type="columnLine">its jumping about did not dislodge its occupants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In old Virginia the transportation of tobacco in great casks</seg><seg type="columnLine">by attaching journals to the heads and having horses drag them</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, the casks rolling along behind them, represents the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--a collection as it were of discs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When a disc is in rapid rotation, it develops gyroscopic force</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this is what makes the spinning top preserve its equilibrium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes it when displaced restore itself and come up to its vertical</seg><seg type="columnLine">axis of rotation again. It is the force that is used on the gyro*</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopic compass, and on a larger scale on the stabilizing gyroscope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent ships from rolling. There are tons and tons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo in ships which are controlled by a rotating disc. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gyroscopic force, to which we have alluded, is employed to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectiles in their proper trajectory. ^ The little pellet of lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the 22-calibre rifle and the 16-inch steel projectile from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great naval guns are both set in rotation around their axes so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that each represents a cylinder made up of whirling discs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gyroscopic force prevents variation from their due course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as we stop to think that every steam engine, gas engine oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">water wheel is devoted to whirling discs around, we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what an important part it plays in the mechanics of the world.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then as we come down to minutiae you will find in a little ten*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cent glass cutter a minute disc of steel, and this disc, very hard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp, makes a mark upon glass which determines where it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">break. It is, in other words, somewhat incorrectly called a glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutter, but of course, it doesn't cut. Again we have the smallest</seg><seg type="columnLine">type of disc doing a really wonderful work, a ten-cent disc dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing the very expensive diamond which, previous to the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention of this glass cutter, was used by all glaziers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The system of power represented in this country by factory</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by railroad, by automobiles--are all based on the use of rota-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting discs. # The wheels must turn or industry ceases. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same applies all over the world. But there are some cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">where mechanical operations are carried on by percussion, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">reciprocating action is used as the controlling process. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments are: pile drivers, riveters, trip hammers and the like,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which of course, represent in the aggregate a very large</seg><seg type="columnLine">division of mechanics. But the capital they represent, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work they do, is trivial, compared to that done by rotation--by</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning wheels or discs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We often hear stories about space flying--about the visits to</seg><seg type="columnLine">other planets, to other celestial bodies, and here we come across</seg><seg type="columnLine">a case where rotation is eliminated. The action of the propeller</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an airplane is based upon the presence of air. It screws its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through air just as a wood-screw screws its way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood--or, more comparably, as a ship is driven through the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">by its propeller. But at a very short distance from the earth--</seg><seg type="columnLine">say twenty or thirty miles--air is practically absent, and a,little</seg><seg type="columnLine">further---that is, if we get out into space at what may be termed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cosmic distance from the surface of the earth, we will be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">substantially a complete vacuum--and the propeller of an air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane might turn at any speed, but it would have practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">no action whatever in drawing the plane through space--and here</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would have to come, as far as we know, to rocket propulsion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which amounts to the expulsion of gas at high velocity from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear of the plane; the axes of the rocket, or cases from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gases are discharged, would be parallel with the axis of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine. In other words, we are definitely removed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of the whirling disc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be easy to go on for a very long time citing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases to which the idea of a whirling disc may be made to apply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the reader has only to think for a moment of how many</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines--for a watch, or anything of that sort, is a machine--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or mechanical appliances he can name, in which the rotating</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel or the rotating disc does not play an all-important part,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To take a very popular illustration of a disc, we may take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baseball. The wonderful curves that the expert pitcher can</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce are based upon two things: the gyroscopic action of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotating set of discs and the friction of its rotation against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere through which it goes. So, even a World's Series</seg><seg type="columnLine">Game depends largely upon the rotation of a set of discs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">graduated sizes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">997</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Explorers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By Harl Vincent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Author of "Barton's Island"Microcosmic Buccaneersetc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   IGANTIC telescopes of enormous power have been made and planets</seg><seg type="columnLine">vJT and satellites have been studied many millions of miles away.

Only a trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it could help us solve the mysteries of its hidden side. Still, accepting cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain hypotheses, certain conclusions may be permissible. Mr. Vincent, appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently, has been wondering about the subject in question and in his character-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istic manner gives us his views in an excellent piece of scientific fiction.

They had retired to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walton's office for a talk after almost thirty-six hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">of continuous work in the research laboratory of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corporation whose engineering department was presided</seg><seg type="columnLine">over by Gary. The rolls of tape contained messages in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unfamiliar dot and dash code.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, I know," replied the inventor. "Those mes-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sages were undoubtedly transmitted by intelligent beings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though we have no means of decoding them. It is com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratively easy to show that the code is a real means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication, that there are thirty-seven separate char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acters recurring with varying frequency, and that nine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen of these characters are the same as certain of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in Continental Morse. This should prove the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istence of a language and a code foreign to our earth--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spaces between letters--the longer spaces between</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, and all that. The world might easily believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the messages come from another planet, but not from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon--the body whose surface has been most closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined and on which we are certain there is no life."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But the readings of the direction finders?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ray's brow creased in perplexity. "That is the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of it," he said. "Our indications are definite. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have followed the signals for many hours and the shift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of our loops has kept constantly in line with our satel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lite. The signals can not have come from any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, excepting by reflection."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reflection! Fiddlesticks!" snorted Walton. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know as well as I do that such signals, if they could reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">us from another planet by reflection from the moon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would also reach us directly and a line could be obtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their original source with our direction finders. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray, you are arguing against your own convictions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These signals come from the moon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how? Doggone it, Gary, when Lesser invented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the super-telescope in 1952, the first thing he examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the surface of the moon. With the tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnifying power it would be possible to see a sparrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the moon's surface, but he saw nothing living. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing living has been observed in the fifteen years dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing which his instrument has been in use all over the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">998</seg><seg type="columnLine">The face of the moon was in shadow, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone with a fair degree of brightness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      world. Life has been found on Mars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Venus. There is a fair evidence of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence on certain of the satellites of Jupiter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturn. But on the moon--never."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nevertheless you must admit that our messages</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the supposedly uninhabited satellite."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," admitted Parsons, slowly, "they did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, by all that's good and holy, I can't account for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. And neither can you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young inventor sat slouched in his chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disheveled and weary. He was bewildered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgruntled over the findings of the recent experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments in which he had requested the aid of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">older man. True, they had proved to their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction the points they had set out to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termine. Ray had reached a similar conclusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">previously in his own workshop, but had hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the more powerful apparatus in the laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great organization, in wThose New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">headquarters he now sat, would show his original</seg><seg type="columnLine">data to be erroneous. It was too preposterous!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would not dare to publish his findings on ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of the storm of protest that would come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great scientists with whom he was already at</seg><seg type="columnLine">loggerheads. Suddenly he pulled himself up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By George, Gary," he said, "this thing has me</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuckoo.

But I'll build myself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship of some kind that'll get me there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the advantage?

In some fancied underground realm?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ray laughed once more. "Now who's the kill-joy?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he inquired. "A few minutes ago you were on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the argument."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The older man grinned. "Oh, go ahead," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you'll have your own way no matter how much I argue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But promise me you will take me along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure thing.

But when, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirtieth floor or thereabouts, Ray let forth a yell like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Comanche, he was so startled that he let go of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troller handle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter?" asked Gary, in real concern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got it!

But he grew more</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatient as time passed and when Ray ultimately noti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied him that all was in readiness he hastened to Grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Central Terminal and boarded the first train that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take him to the small hamlet in Monroe County where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray's laboratory was located.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ray Parsons was an unusual figure in the scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. At his graduation from college he had spent two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years wandering about the world with nothing to do but</seg><seg type="columnLine">play. Instead of playing, however, he seized the oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity of visiting the great universities and research</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratories of Europe, there conferring with scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">of note and occasionally making a stop of several weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to assist in some particularly interesting work that hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to be under way. The young man's wealth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability found him a welcome abroad and he learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">much during this period, incidentally contributing not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little of his own knowledge and downright genius. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was recalled to New York at the untimely death of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father and found himself an orphan, possessed of more</seg><seg type="columnLine">riches than he knew what to do with. The money he</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly forgot, excepting as a means to an end, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightway set about indulging himself in his hobby--</seg><seg type="columnLine">science. He equipped one of the finest private labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tories in the United States and, with a few assistants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried himself in the work he had chosen. The succeed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ten years saw his rise to the position of an authority</seg><seg type="columnLine">of note--an authority of such preeminence that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually subject to the critical and ofttimes caustic</seg><seg type="columnLine">animadversions of the savants who envied him his not-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able accomplishments. But he remained unspoiled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">praise and unperturbed by criticism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gary Walton mused on these things as his train sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward. His own case was quite different. Reared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in poverty, he had been forced to start working at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">early age and had worked hard ever since. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty-six, just ten years older than Ray, and had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled up thirty years of experience that had begun with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clerkship in the office of the first organization to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercialize television-radio and bring it into the homes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the nation. From this small beginning he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled upward, growing up with the organization as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it eventually merged writh and obtained control of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire and cable companies, the various broadcasting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">commercial radio corporations, until it finally emerged as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sole owner and operator of all communication systems</seg><seg type="columnLine">in use on earth. His experience, though in a specialized</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, was highly valuable and the reward for his years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard work and self-education came in the not to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">despised position he now held.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When his train slowed down at the station he caught a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of Ray's low-slung red roadster and the smile on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of the inventor apprised him of the fact that an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other engineering triumph had been achieved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Welcome to our city," Ray greeted him, when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung across the platform and approached the car.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE EXPLORERS OF CALLISTO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1001</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks," grunted Gary, feigning sarcasm, "Fm</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome now that the work is done, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not sore, are you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ray's eyes twinkled. He knew that his friend hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">being left out of anything until the last moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course not--really. But you might at least have</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me what you were doing,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He climbed in beside his grinning friend and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were soon rolling along the main thoroughfare of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town and headed for the outskirts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The laboratory was a rambling group of buildings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some frame, some brick, and a few of moulded concrete.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">These were set well back from the road about a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">from town and were separated from the neighboring</seg><seg type="columnLine">farm houses by broad rolling fields that comprised the</seg><seg type="columnLine">property Ray had purchased after his father's demise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gary noted that a considerable area to the rear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings had been walled off by a high board-fence</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose eight foot top was surmounted by several lines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening barbed wire,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got the ship well hidden, haven't you?" he commented</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the car pulled up on the gravel drive alongside the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You bet! And we're going to keep it hidden until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have all the dope on these strange messages. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, have there been any more ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Every five days, as regular as clockwork, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin at midnight and transmit for one hour and twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. They seem to have a regular schedule now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I have a whole roomful of tape. Don't know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are ever going to do with it all, unless we toss it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the window when there is another hero-parade up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broadway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we're going to learn who is working the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitter up there on the moon, anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ray inserted his key in the lock of a heavy door in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence as he spoke. When he swung this door open Gary</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped at what he saw at the near end of the enclosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, it's nothing but an airplane!" he exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With a few important differences," his friend con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the "Meteor," as Ray had christened the vessel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did indeed resemble a standard high speed enclosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane. The body was some forty feet in length, torpedo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped and surmounted by a single wing-structure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed ridiculously small and of unusual thickness on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leading edge. Not more than twenty feet from wing</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip to wing tip did this plane measure. The landing gear</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not unusual, comprising the regulation rubber-tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels and tail skid. The tail structure was likewise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">conventional design with fins and rudder that might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come from the shop of one of the standard airplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacturers. At the nose there showed the standard</seg><seg type="columnLine">propeller of gleaming bakelite. The body was of polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal with the exception of numerous circular windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed to be of extremely thick glass. Surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the tapered tail and blunt nose of the body there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a number of cylinders of about six inches diameter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eight feet in length. These looked for all the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the barrels of small cannon and gave the craft a war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like appearance. There was not a strut or a guy wire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mar the symmetry of the whole or to destroy the impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of indestructible rigidity presented by the sleek</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Isn't she a beauty ?" asked Ray enthusiastically,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure is. But what makes it go ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Thoroughly Equipped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE short, rotund figure of an overalled man</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged from a circular hatch and dropped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eddie Dowling," said Ray.

I hear you're going with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This from the smiling-faced, chubby Dowling, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped his hands on a piece of cotton waste as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Eddie. Haven't seen you in a.year. Yes, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going along--think we'll get there?" said Gary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The smiling countenance became owlishly solemn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Positively. Wait till you see this ship. She's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corker."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dowling went to the shop for some tools and Ray and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gary climbed through the circular hatch into a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber inside the vessel. This chamber formed an air</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock and communicated with the interior through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second circular hatch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The center compartment of the Meteor was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen feet in diameter and of approximately the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">length between the partitions separating it from the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">two sections. There was a periscope arrangement that</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided an unobstructed view ahead and to the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the pilot's seat. The circular windows in the double</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellular hull gave vision in all other directions. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were four bunks, two upper and two lower, besides two</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably upholstered double seats and a small table</seg><seg type="columnLine">that folded in beside the bunks. The rest of this chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cluttered with the controls and a mass of compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated mechanisms, most of which were entirely unfa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar to Gary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the forward compartment there was the fifteen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder radial engine and its fuel supply, the motor be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of six hundred horsepower rating. The rear com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment contained the heating, refrigerating and air</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditioning apparatus as well as the supply of provi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions and other stores required in the trip. Altogether it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an over-crowded interior, though neat and orderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">withal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ray pressed a button as Gary sank into the cushions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one of the divan-like seats. There was the whine of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a motor coming up to speed and the engineer gazed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiringly at his friend as a strange feeling crept over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand up," Ray commanded with a twinkle in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he laughed boyishly as Gary struggled against an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseen force in the effort to rise to his feet.

"Those things have all been anticipated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll leave through the air locked entrance and return</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same way.

We'll have weapons in our belts and every-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing necessary, including miniature radios in the hel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mets so that we can converse up to a distance of a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I give up," said Gary helplessly.

There were no witnesses in the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed field and mo news of their projected journey had</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaked out to the press or news broadcasters. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was in readiness and Eddie Dowling mounted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot's seat with a grin that spread from ear to ear. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had piloted the ship on a trial the preceding evening and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so enthused and so anxious to get out of the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaches of the atmosphere that he could scarcely wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Ray's signal to start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the view plate of the periscope there appeared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad expanse of the field ahead and the high board</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence at the far end, beyond which there was a clump</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think she'll clear the woods with this load, Eddie?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. Cleared it a mile last night, and there isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred pounds extra on board now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You should know. Let her go then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right-o!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie yanked the starter lever as if he wished to pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from its socket. There was a grinding roar up front,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the smooth purr of the motor. Faster and faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun the propeller. Then he pulled another lever which</seg><seg type="columnLine">released the brakes below them and they started rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the field. As the powerful motor picked up speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">under full throttle, its exhaust gases being discharged</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost noiselessly to the rear through the long pipes</seg><seg type="columnLine">which hung beneath the streamlined body, they sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more swiftly until the tail was up. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels were clear and, with a sharp rise that carried them</seg><seg type="columnLine">well over the fence and trees, they were off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The "Meteor" climbed at a steep angle in Eddie's eager-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness to gain altitude quickly and in less than five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">1004</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the altimeter registered twenty thousand feet. Soon it</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed thirty thousand feet, then forty and the speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motor had increased perceptibly while the ship seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be climbing more slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Air's getting pretty rare outside," Ray explained at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gary's questioning glance. "Pretty soon the propeller</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't take hold at all and we'll have to use the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the day of the new moon and, at the angle they</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed, its orb was visible in the periscope screen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were heading directly for their destination. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore long the altimeter needle had reached the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scale and Ray placed in operation two instruments of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own design. These were distance and speed indicators</seg><seg type="columnLine">which depended on the earth's attraction for their opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, rather than on the barometric pressure as in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of the standard altimeter. So condensed were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scales of these instruments at the lower readings that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the needles scarcely flickered with their comparatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow speed and nearness to the earth. The stick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudder-bar wobbled loosely at the touch of Eddie's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feet. The air resistance was approaching zero and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motor raced alarmingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cut the throttle, Eddie," ordered Ray, "and give her</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a ten second burst from the rear rocket tubes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The motor coughed and died. Eddie turned to a panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a number of buttons arranged like the keys of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">typewriter. He pressed five or six of these and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a blast of rapid, staccato barks from the rear. Gary</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a sensation of being suddenly thrown through space</seg><seg type="columnLine">with tremendous velocity but this passed immediately as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the acceleration compensating energy responded. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked through one of the circular windows in the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and exclaimed aloud at what he saw. The earth, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had but a moment previously been a huge bowl, was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">a perfect globe of enormous size that receded rapidly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he watched. He could scarce drag his eyes from the mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velous sight, but turned quickly at a shout from Ray and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddie. The speed indicator registered eight thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour and the needle was moving steadily to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right over the scale whose highest graduation was at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred thousand miles an hour!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Glory be!" shouted Eddie. "She's even faster than</seg><seg type="columnLine">you figured, Chief. Man alive--we're traveling!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No wonder," said Ray drily. "You had the rockets on</seg><seg type="columnLine">for nearly a half minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie turned a crestfallen face toward them. "So I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did," he admitted sheepishly. "Good thing the compen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sators worked so well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So rapid was the acceleration with no air friction to</seg><seg type="columnLine">retard it that, within the hour, they had reached a ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locity of nearly thirty thousand miles an hour. The trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be completed much sooner than Ray had antici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gary watched spellbound as the earth receded and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon grew larger and nearer. He experienced a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of detachment as the great gleaming sphere that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was their world took on a green luminescence that shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">eerily against the blackness of the firmament whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars presented the entirely new aspect of glowing bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liantly without the accustomed twinkle caused by mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of an intervening atmosphere. Ahead and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, the sun was a blinding blaze of magnificence, shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing great streamers of flame far into space in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. The moon, several times larger than it ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared from the earth, now showed a bright, pencil-line</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crescent as the triangle formed by their ship, the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the moon grew smaller and the angles slowly altered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The face of the moon was in shadow but shone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fair degree of brightness by light reflected from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. But so brilliant was the sun-lit crescent at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left edge that the face seemed almost wholly dark by</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparison. And steadily it drew closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their speed had become constant at about thirty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles an hour and Ray started experimenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the tail rockets. He pressed a couple of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol buttons for an instant and the resulting discharges</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung the needle well over the fifty thousand mark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another touch and it reached seventy. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling at more than a thousand miles a minute! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior of the "Meteor" was as comfortable and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal as regards temperature, air quality and gravity as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they were flying at ordinary speed and altitude over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guess I was very conservative in my estimates," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray, "and I believe I know where I made an error,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsonite, you know, when it is exploded on e&amp;rth, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duces about four million times its own volume in ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panding gases. But out here in the vacuum the specific</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume of the gas is vastly greater and that makes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference. In my calculations, of course, I considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weight of the discharged gases and that does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">change with the lowering in pressure. But the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume must have considerable effect since, at each ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion, we leave behind a far larger cloud against which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to react. This larger cloud, while of the same weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have considerably greater instantaneous inertia."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly what I thought," grinned Eddie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, of course, that is a foolish explanation, in viola-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the simple law of Newton," said Ray, "The real</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for the higher speed is that a higher muzzle ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locity is obtained in the rocket tubes due to the expanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gases to a lower pressure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At any rate," Gary interjected, "we are getting there</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty fast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had cast a glance at the instrument board and</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that the distance from the earth was now well</seg><seg type="columnLine">over 170 thousand miles. And they were scarcely three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours out!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," agreed Ray, "and it will soon He time for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change in direction."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they had reached the 200 thousand mile mark</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the moon appeared as large before them as did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth behind, Ray took the controls. He swung a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever over the face of a graduated quadrant and pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single button of the rocket-control keyboard. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a few rapid, machine gun-like reports from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear and the moon's image swung well to the left of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">periscope screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll pass it on the shadowed side," he stated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sun and moon were both visible through the circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows now and it was not long until the moon's disc</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit into the right side of the flaming orb and slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">started crossing. They were producing an eclipse all</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own and it was a vastly different one from those</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnessed on earth. The apparent diameter of the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now so immense that it gradually swallowed up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun and its long flaming streamers as well. When they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in exact opposition with the two bodies, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Meteor" was plunged into a baleful green semi-darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sole illumination being by light reflected from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth and by that of the earth re-reflected from the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE EXPLORERS OF CALLISTO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1005</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the moon. The firmament became of ebon</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness, the brilliant points of light that were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars and planets contributing but little to the light that</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamed through their circular windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the first wavering tips of the sun's great promi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nences started to appear on the other side and the bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant orb wras soon in full view once more. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty minutes and a crescent of brightness appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the moon's edge and this widened rapidly as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Meteor" dashed through space with its speed still un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked. The lunar orb was half illuminated and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance from earth showed 236 thousand miles before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray manipulated the control buttons of the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket tubes. They were passing the moon at a distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of about five thousand miles and it was of colossal size</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Path of a Beam of Waves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RAY pressed fully half the keys on the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel, putting all the rocket tubes at the nose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">- operation. Time and again he pressed the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">group for a period of ten or fifteen seconds and at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure there was a responding rat-tat-tat and a momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary sensation of being thrown forward in the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The compensators worked beautifully, however, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced not the slightest discomfort at the tremend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous rate of deceleration. In a very short time they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerably overshot their destination and the needle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the speed indicator had dropped well toward zero.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray played the keyboard now like a piano and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens rotated before them as the "Meteor" swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">around in the arc of a huge circle. Another few'</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes and the sun was almost directly overhead with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lighted surface of the moon just beneath. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were looking at its other side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From a position estimated by Ray as about two thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand miles above the surface it was quite apparent that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side they had never seen was mightily different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face presented toward the earth. There were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude of the familiar craters, several of these being</seg><seg type="columnLine">even larger than Ptolmey and Copernicus. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater portion of the surface which now hid the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from view was occupied by huge areas resembling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mare Serenitatis and the Mare Tranquilitatis but of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodigious extent and deeply depressed rather than pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senting comparatively level surfaces, thus more deserving</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being termed seas. From the close range the craters</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed quite likely to have been formed by the impact of</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorites when the moon was in a plastic state, as sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested by Gilbert. An intricate network of rays and rills</seg><seg type="columnLine">interconnected the numerous craters and the seas, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays gleaming with the blue-white color of polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">cobalt and the rills revealing themselves as lengthy chasms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cracks of unspeakable depth. The visitors were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their knees, observing through the floor windows this</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvel of creation never before seen by earthly eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A touch of a button had headed the "Meteor" in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same direction followed by the moon in its orbit and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">now seemed to be hanging motionless above its surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Actually they were traveling* in space at the same speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over the same course as the earth's satellite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's a wonderful sight, boys," said Gary solemnly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Marvelous," agreed Ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You said something," came from Eddie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ray fussed with the small levers that swrung the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket tubes out radially from the hull. He pressed two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the control keys and there came a few sharp raps from</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead, both forward and to the rear. The moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to leap upward to meet them and Ray manipu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated various other buttons rapidly. By alternating be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween upper and lower tubes, he soon maneuvered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel to within ten or fifteen miles of the surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The panorama that spread before their eyes as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Meteor" sped along at this altitude in response to Ray's</seg><seg type="columnLine">further manipulations was bizarre in the extreme.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They crossed a crater of fully 150 miles diameter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose depth was no less than five miles. In the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of this crater there rose a slender spire of deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">green hue that reached a height of probably six or seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles above the crater's bottom. A lofty mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">range loomed ahead as they crossed the far rim of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater--perpendicular peaks lifted their pointed finials to</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscionable altitudes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie busied himself with the mechanism of a camera</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was set flush with the floor, its lens mounted out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side on the bottom of the hull. The shutter clicked in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessantly as he replaced roll after roll of exposed film</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fresh. Ray kept constant watch of his instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">and occasionally fired a light rocket charge below to</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintain their altitude and direction of travel. Gary's</seg><seg type="columnLine">optics were working overtime as they dropped to two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The manometer showed no atmospheric pressure out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the ship and the stopping of the heat generators and</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting of the refrigerating motors caused Ray to glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the thermometer that recorded outside temperature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was near the boiling point!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is just about noon of the long lunar day," said Ray.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then there are about fourteen of our days to pass be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore there will be darkness at this point ?" inquired Gary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right. And it's going to be good and hot out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the sun as long as we're near the surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably be quite a bit cooler in shadow, though, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we leave the ship we'll have to keep to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows to keep from boiling."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are there no means of cooling the air-tight suits?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"None. But that doesn't worry me. If we can't live</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direct rays of the sun, neither can the other fellow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll find them in deep shade."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are you going to find any shadows with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun almost directly overhead ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the larger rills at great depth or possibly under</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhanging ledges at the shores of the great seas."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They now followed a ledge that shone beneath them</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a vein of pure silver. They were to discover later</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was nearly unadulterated cobalt. This ledge led</seg><seg type="columnLine">them through an almost level valley, fringed on both</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides by the greenish spires whose material proved sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequently to be nephrite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After an hour of travel in this manner they came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the immense bowl that was the largest of the seas they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had observed from far above. It was an enormous de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression and, as they crossed the near rim, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had come to the edge of the moon for the great bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ren concavity was as deep as fifty miles or more in spots</seg><seg type="columnLine">within their range of vision. A steep, overhanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipice marked its rim and they skirted this at moder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate speed, examining the streaked wall carefully for</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ray tuned in the radio to the wave-length on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had received the messages back there in New York.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1006</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He dapped the phones to his ears and listened intently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were no signals, but a continual musical hum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a hundred cycles frequency assailed his ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums. This rose and fell in volume like a fading sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal but he had no way of determining from whence it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For two hours more they skirted the multi-colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipice, slowing down occasionally to peer closely at</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange formations that had, from a greater distance, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled human dwellings. But there was still no sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie had taken numerous photographs and he desisted'</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the work as the sameness of the view became all</seg><seg type="columnLine">too apparent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll have lots of evidence when we get back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief," he smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and we'll need it, if we find no more than we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have found so far in the way of a lunar radio trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitter. Wonder where the devil it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noting that it was nearing midnight by earth time, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced the headphones of the radio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hum's gone now," he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he and the two other passengers were electrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the shrill, penetrating note of continuous wave code</seg><seg type="columnLine">signals that came in so loudly as to be heard throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compartment. Ray hastily removed the phones to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save his ear-drums.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boy! They must be close!" he exclaimed. "Either</seg><seg type="columnLine">that or it is an extremely powerful transmitter, which of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course it must be if it was used to communicate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the other planets."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" shouted Gary suddenly, from his position at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the windows. "There it is! Ahead there to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His companions peered in the direction indicated and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the top of the cliff not a mile ahead, they saw large</seg><seg type="columnLine">fan-shaped structures topping two tall metal towers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">strands of this odd antenna reflected the sun's unob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed rays with the unmistakable reddish hue of cop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per wires or tubing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No wonder it nearly knocked my ears off," said Ray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning off the current that fed the tubes of the radio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nosed the ship downward with a few carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed shots from the tubes and they dove into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of the cliff. At first the darkness seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense but there was really a considerable amount of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected light from the neighboring sun-lit surfaces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arid sea bottom. As their eyes became used to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden change from the brilliance of the lunar mid-day</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the twilight of this shaded region they made out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange village ahead. It looked like the "tank farm" of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an oil refinery back home. Fully forty large metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders reared themselves from the level bottom at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the cliffs and these were of unmistakably human</seg><seg type="columnLine">design and construction. As they drew nearer they</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out the forms of several bipeds who moved in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out between the habitations, walking erect in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner as humans of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first sign of life!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Pursuing Lunarians</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was necessary to fire an occasional light rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge and in each case the luminous gases of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion lighted the shaded area like a flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning. It was thus but a short time until their pres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ence was revealed to the lunar inhabitants. A great</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of these tumbled from the doors of the circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwellings and they milled about and gesticulated ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citedly over the unexpected appearance of the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On closer view it was seen that these beings were</seg><seg type="columnLine">accoutered in garments very similar to those that reposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lockers of the rear compartment of the "Meteor."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The suits, also of pliable material, bulged ludicrously in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vacuum under pressure of the air from within and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each figure was topped by an egg-shaped helmet of shiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was difficult to maintain the position of the "Meteor"</seg><seg type="columnLine">without traveling at considerable speed, for the craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">bobbed about uncertainly under the influence of succes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive charges fired from the tubes. Ray decided to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a landing and he maneuvered the vessel to a point about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile from the village and there dropped to the surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At their contact there arose a cloud of gray powder that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut off their view for several minutes. With the subse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent raising of the cloud they saw that a group of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lunarians were approaching them with great speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">progressed in leaps that carried them thirty or forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet at each jump. Evidently they hailed from another</seg><seg type="columnLine">body in the solar system--a body whose gravity was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly equivalent to that of the earth, assuming the</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical strength of these beings to be about equal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the Tellurians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the more curious of the beings had approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a hundred feet of the "Meteor" they formed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">semicircle and it was seen at once that each of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the party carried a slender rod of about four</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet length, these rods being equipped with bulbous pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuberances and presenting the appearance of weapons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like a company of well-trained soldiers they raised the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar small arms and directed them at the "Meteor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hope our insulating envelope holds out," remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray. "Those are quite evidently ray projectors of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At his words there came a blinding flare from each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rods and their bodies were subjected to a stinging,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prickling sensation that betokened a heavily charged at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere within the vessel. The light flashes that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verged on the outer surface of the staunch craft seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have no other effect and Eddie whooped with glee</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they saw that the Lunarians were mystified at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure of their attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came another burst of the blinding flashes after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment and the "'Meteor" lurched and tilted at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarming angle as one of the rays took effect on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing gear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say!" exclaimed Ray. "This will never do! Sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose they shoot away our wings and landing gear en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely? We'll have some trouble in landing when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to earth. I'm going to try the short waves on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He advanced to a powerful high-frequency transmit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter and started its motor generator. The tubes glowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant response and Ray swung a lever on the panel of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the transmitter slowly from left to right, watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy meanwhile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just warming, them up a bit," he explained to Gary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Watch!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That little transmitter, by conduction through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether, was inducing high-frequency currents of nearly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million alternations per second in the bodies of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE EXPLORERS OF CALLISTO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1007</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">His companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered in the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection indicated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, at the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliffs, not a mile ahead, they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">large fan-shaped structures topping two</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall metal towers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lunarians. Soon their bodily temperature</seg><seg type="columnLine">would begin to rise and it would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">long until they were all laid low with</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging fevers and racing pulses. Ray did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wish to kill any of them unless it wras</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary in self defense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the Lunarians sank slowly to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees, then rolled forward and lay prone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Others of them moved about in a be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">1008</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered manner as if searching for the cause of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden illness. Another dropped, then two more and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in less time than it takes to tell, they lay helpless in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," said Ray, "we'll go out and look them over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our own suits are insulated against these vibrations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hastily they donned the heavy suits and globular hel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mets. Ray showed Gary how to adjust the oxygen ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus and how to operate the various instruments that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung from the outside belt. One of these was the flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol with which Gary was already slightly familiar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They entered the air lock and bolted the inner hatch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Eddie unbolted the outer hatch and they plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the hiss of the escaping air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie was first to drop into the thick powder that</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpeted the ground and he took the first experimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">step, tumbling into a ludicrous heap as he lost his bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance in the eight-foot spring that resulted from his slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort. It would require a little time for them to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to moving about in a gravity field only one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixth as strong as their own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They shuffled through the powdery footing until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the outstretched lunarians. Gary kneeled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the prostrate forms and peered through the single</seg><seg type="columnLine">window of his helmet. He recoiled at the look of hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">that flashed through from the bloodshot eyes of the help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less being. But the fevered face that looked out at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unmistakably human. With the exception of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly purpled skin that was probably caused by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificially produced fever, this man might have been one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the millions that inhabited his home city on earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The phones in his helmet spoke loudly and he gazed up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled at the voice of Ray that seemed to come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">so close by. He was astonished at seeing the ballooned</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of his friend fully a hundred feet from him. Thfcn</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remembered the helmet radios.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gary," came the voice, ''these people are just like our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own in features and in stature."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. It seems incredible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sharp cry in Eddie's voice startled them both and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were still further astonished when they looked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction pointed to by his bloated, outstretched arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its bulging enclosure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About five hundred yards away, out of reach of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations from the "Meteor" that still charged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether, five of the lunarians were chasing a sixth figure--</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of their own kind. From the smaller stature and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter leaps of the fugitive, they deduced that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman, and when this one stumbled, falling heavily in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dust and burying the huge helmet in folded arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they felt more than certain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment the pursuers caught sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">round-helmeted strangers, the strange ship, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prostrate forms of their own kind. They stopped short</seg><seg type="columnLine">and two of them raised rods similar to those carried by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helpless victims at their feet. Eddie was nearest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">line and the two flashes from the raised weapons con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verged in his direction. Instinctively he dodged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impetus of his movement threw him fifteen feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the line of fire. In a rage he grasped the flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol that depended from his belt and trained it on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lunarians. There was a brilliant spurt of scarlet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the attackers was consumed in the angry flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">that struck him full in the chest. Before the other could</seg><seg type="columnLine">again bring his own weapon into play he, too, fell a victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the angry Eddie. The oxygen in their own suits</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">made brilliant torches of the two Lunarians as the deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame got in its work. The other three were unarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they fled precipitately in the direction of the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage, leaving the erstwhile fugitive still cowering in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three Tellurians advanced to the crumpled figure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which shrank from them as they drew near. Eddie</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed his helmet close to the larger egg-shaped one and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked through the two intervening windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Christopher!" he exclaimed. "It's a girl! And a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peach!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By pantomime they convinced her they would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm her and eventually got her to her feet and indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated their desire to take her within their vessel. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a considerable amount of gesturing and nodding and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowing on both sides she finally accompanied them will-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly and they noticed that she shrank in alarm from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prostrate figures of her compatriots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes they were all four in the air-locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance of the "Meteor" and, when Eddie had bolted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer hatch, they heard the welcome hiss of air entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chamber from the pumps in the rear compartment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No sooner were they within when the girl tore her helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her head and threw it to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They fell back, amazed at the wild beauty that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronted them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Communicating by Pictures</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE torrent of speech that assailed their ears might</seg><seg type="columnLine">well have been a paean of praise, so softly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly did the unfamiliar syllables of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">euphonic language roll from her tongue. But the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">that glinted in the wondrous brown eyes and the gestures</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which she supplemented the unintelligible disser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation told them she was berating her recent pursuers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With their helmets in hand the three men listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">politely, but with expressions of such bewildered inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termination that the girl broke off and stared from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other for a moment. Then she burst into laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">--peal after peal of contagious merriment rang through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow confines of the "Meteor." The ice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indicating her own person with a sweeping gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a bow, the girl uttered a single word, "Lola."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gary completed the introduction by naming his two</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends and himself. The three derived much amuse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment from her efforts at reproducing his pronunciation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Eddie and Gary. With the single syllable, Ray, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no difficulty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men removed their cumbersome suits and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded to do likewise. When she was revealed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snugly fitting, silver-hued garment that would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">created a furore on one of their bathing beaches at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, they exchanged embarrassed glances. But the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed entirely at ease and unabashed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was soon evident that Lola was an extremely in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligent girl, for she immediately realized that explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions could be made only by signs and drawings. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to a wall chart of the earth and nodded brightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show that she knew what it represented. By going</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the motions of sketching she indicated that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired to be supplied with drawing materials, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed delightedly when Ray handed her a pad of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper and a pencil. She examined both as if they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat strange to her, but, after experimenting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE EXPLORERS OF CALLISTO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1009</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the pencil a bit, she started drawing a series of concentric</seg><seg type="columnLine">circles on the paper. In the center she drew a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle which she speedily shaded to represent a sphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then on each of the concentric circles she placed another</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere of smaller size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By George!" exclaimed Ray. "She's drawing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was confirmed at once by Lola, who pointed again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wall chart, then to the sphere on the third con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centric circle she had drawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tora," she averred confidently. Then hesitatingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ray, Ed-dee, Gair-ree--meer Tora."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She knows we are from the earth," gasped Ray, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her name for our planet is Tora."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lola then pointed to the sphere on her fifth concentric</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle and rapidly marked nine small dots at varying</seg><seg type="columnLine">distances from this globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The nine satellites of Jupiter!" exclaimed Ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She pointed to the fifth dot from the sphere, then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself, intoning solemnly, "Lola--meer Thares."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Callisto," said Ray, "the satellite of more than three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles diameter whose distance from Jupiter is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one and a third million miles. The girl is from Callisto,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Thares, as she calls it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," objected Gary, "she seems to be at home in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth gravity as simulated in the "Meteor"--she was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leap twenty or more feet on the moon's surface. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">can that be if the satellite she hails from is so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller than our earth?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The smaller body might still have a similar surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity," Ray explained. "Since the kinship of gravity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and magnetism was proved, our older estimates based</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the mass of a body have been thrown into the discard</seg><seg type="columnLine">in many instances. It may well be that this satellite has</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gravity equivalent to our own."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing that her efforts were bringing understanding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she tore the first sheet from the pad and started sketch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the second sheet. This girl from the distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">satellite was an artist. By the use of a very few strokes</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was able to produce wonderful likenesses of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings, machines, buildings. She first drew a king seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a throne; then his consort, a beautiful woman. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet she drew a child--a girl of perhaps ten years</seg><seg type="columnLine">of age whom she called Lola. Their visitor was a prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess ! She studied their faces and beheld astonished com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehension. Then she drew even more rapidly, using</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet after sheet of the paper as she warmed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">task. Her sketches formed a picture history of her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and of the peoples of her own world. She pictured</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific advances made by two separate and distinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">races of beings, the one clan being dark-haired like her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, the other seemingly of larger stature and extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">blond. The overthrow of the government and the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sassination of her parents she wept over. The plans of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light-haired ones she pictured vividly, showing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their astronomers were cognizant of the desirability of,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth as a field for conquest. She sketched space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships of huge size with which the journey was to be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">and indicated the plans for using the earth's satellite as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-by base for hostile operations. Her own kidnaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the leader of the warlike blond horde she stormed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, finally'ending the story with her escape and subse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent release from her tormentors by the earth men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she had finished, she turned a happy face to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three men who had watched so silently and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'll be hornswoggled!" said Eddie. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole story for us. These doggoned Calisthenics, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever you want to call them, are figuring on busting</seg><seg type="columnLine">us up back home. Can you beat that for nerve ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ray and Gary grinned at his explosive remarks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silvery laugh of Lola once more brightened the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior of the "Meteor" when she observed the comical</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression of consternation that spread over the chubby</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the mechanic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All the same," said Ray, "this is a serious matter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am going to try and learn more from Lola, though I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am afraid my own efforts at picture-writing will not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">as successful. Meanwhile I think we should repair the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing gear and disarm the helpless Callistonians out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side before we release them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right, Chief," said Eddie. "I'll get out the welding</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfit and take care of it right away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He soon had the apparatus ready and again drew on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his air-tight suit. Before he clamped the helmet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">place he cast an admiring look at the sleek blackness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lola's close-cropped tresses, where she bent over Ray's</seg><seg type="columnLine">initial attempt at imitating her method of communicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of pictures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ray's efforts proved successful, due to the keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">perception of the girl and to occasional help from Gary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They learned that the lunar base had been in existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a short time, less than one revolution of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the sun. Lola's eyes glowed at the pictures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace, prosperity and happiness on earth that Ray did his</seg><seg type="columnLine">best to represent. She signified her joy at being within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "Meteor" and her wish to return to the earth with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. It developed that nearly two years were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">required in which to complete the fleet of space ships and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to establish the lunar base of operations. Ray indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">his intention of returning to the earth and preparing its</seg><seg type="columnLine">peoples for the warfare to come, even suggesting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility of building a fleet of their own to visit first</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon, then the satellite Callisto, destroying the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then carrying the war to her own world with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">express intention of overthrowing the power of the light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired ones and restoring Lola's own loved ones to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">birthright of freedom and happiness. His proposals met</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiastic approval and by the time Eddie returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an armful of the enemy's ray projectors, a complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding had been reached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All fixed, Chief," said Eddie, when he had removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his helmet and pushed the slender weapons under one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bunks. "The wheel was not damaged. Neither was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the axle. They had only burnt off one of the struts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was easy. It's as good as new now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine. And now we'll release those poor devils out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pulled the switch that controlled the energy used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to overcome them. Lola did not realize the meaning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this action, but when the men glued their eyes to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows and watched the prostrate figures of the ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies, she knew that the strange instrument in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Meteor" had something to do with their condition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When one of them commenced moving about and even-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually sat upright, she registered a vigorous protest, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no misunderstanding the warning note in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, though the words were unintelligible. She has-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened to employ the sketch pad once more, but before she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to bring her talent to further use, there came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised cry from Eddie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Holy smoke!" he exclaimed. "Here comes a tank!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">1010</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An armored caterpillar tractor was Bearing down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from the direction of the village, and most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently helpless Callistonians were now 011 their feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hailing the approaching war machine with joyful</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaps and wavings of the arms. As the monster engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">neared them, a ray of shimmering yellow shot forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its fore part and impinged on the hull of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">''Meteor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lola screamed as the vessel was surrounded by im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrable darkness, but Ray reassured her smilingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was confident of the efficacy of the "Meteor's" in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulating envelope. But he decided to get out of range of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray on account of the possibility of it causing damage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the outer structure, so he advanced to the rocket con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol keyboard and pressed a few of the buttons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no response! And the temperature in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Meteor" was rising rapidly!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Callistonian Sphere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAT sort of a bombardment is this?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray in astonishment. "These must be vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of a sort I have never encountered. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical system is paralyzed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He worked frantically with the keys, but to no avail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The darkness persisted and the temperature continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rise, though the refrigerating system was working to</seg><seg type="columnLine">capacity. He pondered for a moment as Gary and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddie attempted to calm the now greatly perturbed Lola.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was endeavoring to convey a message to them, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the excitement of the moment was unable to do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have it!" Ray suddenly shouted. "Quick, Eddie--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the emergency lights! We'll fire the rockets with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">batteries."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They hastily dismantled the battery boxes of two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the equipments that had been included in the accoutre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of the "Meteor" on the chance of exploring dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">caverns during the visit. They soon had two sets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful dry cells and quickly set about tearing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moulding in which were hidden the ignition wires of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket tubes. Perspiration poured from their skin as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat increased, but they worked with unabated energy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally the proper wires were located and small sections</seg><seg type="columnLine">of insulation were stripped from the copper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," breathed Ray, "when I give the w?ord, make</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact with the battery terminals. Just two short taps</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the binding posts. Ready?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ready, Chief," panted Eddie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lola and Gary had sunk to their seats, gasping pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully in the superheated atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now!" said Ray, whose throat was so dry he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were a number of answering raps from below</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the two men collapsed where they crouched. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Meteor" sped from its position with tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity and was instantly in the glare of the sun. Bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant beams of its light streamed through the circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows, as the vessel rose far from the moon's surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there were none to observe the cheering sight. Lola</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the three men had lost consciousness. But the pumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rear compartment continued their whirring and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temperature dropped rapidly. Luckily the refrig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erating system was operated from tanks of compressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and had not ceased functioning when the electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">system was paralyzed by the baleful ray of the Callis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie was first to recover and he stared about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderingly as he sat up. For a minute he ruminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazedly, then he remembered and quickly sprang to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, boy!" he drawled, "was that a close one? An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other minute and the 'Meteor' would have been a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">cemetery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rushed to the side of Lola and rubbed her wrists</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantically. So marble-white was her skin that he feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was dead. But he soon whooped his relief as her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyelids fluttered and she drew a long, tremulous breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray and Gary recovered at about the same time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Ray, when he was able to speak, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one I didn't count on. And we got out just in time--</seg><seg type="columnLine">no question of that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked through the lower windows and observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were fully five hundred miles from the moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we have a ray of our own," he continued grimly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and I'm going back and I'll give them a dose of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own medicine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An experimental touch on the keyboard showed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the connections were once more functioning. He pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">several of the keys and they dropped rapidly as the rat-tat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rocket charges answered. Lola objected stren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uously as she saw the ill-omened satellite rushing upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet them. She wanted never to return to the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her most recent sufferings. But Eddie's good-natured</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile and assured manner soon reconciled her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The "Meteor" dropped to within a few hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its recent position and they were astonished to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war machine of the Callistonians had been overturned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the blast from their own rocket tubes. Eddie loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camera and made a few more exposures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half buried in the powdery footing there were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies of a number of the helmeted Callistonians who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been slain in the sudden hurricane resulting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the escape of the "Meteor." The state of collapse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their garments told of the reason for their passing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The force of the concussion had torn the air-tight cover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, allowing the oxygen to escape from within and thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffocating the victims. Not an enemy wa, in sight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray headed for their village. Again he was warned by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lola, but he circled the settlement, looking for signs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. The girl was extremely nervous and they had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">long to wait for the reason for her fear. From a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cylindrical structures there shot forth duplicates</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ray that had nearly proved their undoing. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "Meteor" darted hither and thither as Ray manipu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated the control keys and it was impossible for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy to keep them in range for a long enough time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce any effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there came a surprise, for the "Meteor" halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her rapid movements and was drawn upward by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new and irresistible force. At a quick glance through</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the top windows, Lola cried out in fresh alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had indicated that none of the space ships from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Callisto were on the earth's satillite. But one had evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently returned in time to witness the maneuverings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "Meteor," for high above them hovered a gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere of polished metal from which depended two large</seg><seg type="columnLine">discs like the electromagnets used in the electric cranes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth. From these it was apparent the force ema-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated which was drawing them helplessly aloft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fne kettle of fish!" yelped Eddie. "What to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll try the high-frequency beam on them," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray, leaving the controls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE EXPLORERS OF CALLISTO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1011</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lola sat quietly by, an expression of resigned expecta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of calamity on her beautiful features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They started the generators as the rapidity of rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased and soon the powerful vibrations of the fusing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam were searching the vitals of the great sphere above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. But there was no immediate result and in less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a minute they were thrown to the floor by the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">jar of striking against the metal discs. They were firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached and the discs immediately commenced drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward as the cables attached to them were reeled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above. They were to be brought very close for</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Lola hid her face in despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Can't seem to find a vital spot," grunted Ray, "or else</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship is insulated as we are. But we should be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fuse away some of the outer covering."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He continued the exploring as a party of helmeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Callistonians dropped from a hatch to the upper surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Meteor. Their clumsy metal shoes produced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisy tattoo as they moved about with a heavy piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery which they set up amidships of the top sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the hull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are about to drill through," groaned Gary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry," said Ray; "we'll stop that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started the other transmitter and the vibrations</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had overcome the attackers on the surface were at</seg><seg type="columnLine">work above. Still he continued with the searching mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the fusing beam. The sounds above were stilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they soon heard a body fall to the curved surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then another and another. Two of the stricken Callis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonians slid past a window and slithered over the side, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall to their death in the village far underneath. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the attracting discs let go and the "Meteor"</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to an almost perpendicular position, throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the occupants into a heap against the front partition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got one of their generators!" exulted Ray, crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to his beam controls. "Now for the other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and all those birds that were 011 top are gone,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloated Eddie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the weaving beam failed to produce results and ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray finally concentrated it on a protuberance of the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense vessel to which they were attached. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an almost immediate effect, a small opening fusing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the metal and quickly spreading until a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">section of the protuberance had melted and dripped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the depths beneath. There came a quick jerk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon's surface receded rapidly as the pilot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy vessel attempted a retreat, not thinking to cast off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barnacle that was causing the damage. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwieldy sphere was speedy, for they were soon at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous distance from the previous position. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaping hole now appeared where the protuberance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed and the occupants of the "Meteor" knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air was escaping from the monstrous vessel above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there wras another jerk and the motion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger vessel changed to a wobbly, reeling progression</seg><seg type="columnLine">that betokened disaster. Apparently its crew had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffocated and the machinery was out of control. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Meteor" was doomed to go hurtling through space, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwilling dangler from the unpiloted vagabond of space!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ray tried a terrific rocket blast without effect. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy that had trapped them was too powerful to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus overcome. Then he experimented with various keys</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the direction levers until, with a continuous blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a single tube, he had swung the "Meteor" about</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it lay alongside the spherical hull of the larger ship</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and he could obtain a view of the supports and feeders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attracting disc. The fusing beam was then concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated on the cable fastenings and in a moment they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">free, the "Meteor" roaring away from the wandering</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere under the impulses from the single rocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's that," said Ray, wiping the perspiration from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brow. "I think we had better start for home now</seg><seg type="columnLine">before something else happens."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You said something," agreed Eddie enthusiastically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lola trilled her happiness when their intentions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">made known to her. And Gary was far from sorry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The "Meteor" Plans a Return</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH the shadowed side of the moon behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and the shining greenish orb that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth ahead, Gary conversed seriously with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray, who was at the controls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I fear this presages a fearful conflict," he said. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio of the Callistonians has probably advised their</seg><seg type="columnLine">home body of the happenings of the past few hours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Should we not have destroyed their lunar headquarters?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Probably. But I hated to do it in cold blood. Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can always return in a few hours and I had rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">have authority from the government to proceed before</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaging in such wholesale slaughter.

This affair was being held just</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten floors above the one in which the American Philo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sophical Society was holding its annual meeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reiswick looked as much like a member of the Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can Philosophical Society as like an old football star</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Columbia. Consequently, when he left the elevator at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twentieth floor instead of the one ten stories above,</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsequious waiters ushered him into the banquet hall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;vhere he spent an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dreary eating in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">company of two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">real members of the So-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciety. No one was certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his identity, and so it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thought best not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a chance of offending</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distinguished guest, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for the time being,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently lost in deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. For this reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been placed in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantageous position near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speaker's table. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as his condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">would permit, he gave se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rious attention to the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gramme, though the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lfew papers read made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder when the hip-hip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrah and the usual jolli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fication would begin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He really did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand much of what was said and it was not till</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last speaker was introduced that he heard anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">of interest. This member of the Society was a sociologist</seg><seg type="columnLine">of note and the theme of his address was the gradual</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowering of the birthrate in America. For some un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known reason the wromen of America were becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">sterile. Birth control, companionate marriage, feminine</seg><seg type="columnLine">independence, the high cost of living, the diminution in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size of the average home, could be considered as play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing some part in this lowered birthrate. It was believed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that none of these factors really reached the root</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trouble, and that unless the real reason was found</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rapid drop in the number of births and steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken to correct it, the American people would soon fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its commanding place as a leader of nations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are not enough babies being born," the speaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">said emphatically. "In fact," and here he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">alleviate the seriousness of the situation by speaking in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighter vein, "in fact, unless something is done soon, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may easily be that twenty years from now there will no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer be a football team at Columbia University."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John Reiswick had a one-track mind. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">what made him such a football star in the old days and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same trait had enabled him to become many times a</seg><seg type="columnLine">millionaire in the ten years following his graduation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During these years, his great love had been the football</seg><seg type="columnLine">team of Columbia and its supremacy over all other teams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He spent money as an alumnus as freely as he had spent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his muscles prior to graduation. He worked at making</seg><seg type="columnLine">money but he spent all his spare time increasing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glory of Columbia. Naturally, the part of the speech that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to impress him the most was that statement:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Twenty years from now there will no longer be a foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball team at Columbia University."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He remained quiet till the end of the programme, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then made a beeline for the sociologist. He simply asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one thing---the man's card. In his alcoholic state,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not do any logical thinking, but he did know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this man had made a statement that required in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigation, and he also knew that the next morning he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have a clear head. With the card in his pocket, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the banquet hall, as dignified and as drunk as when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he entered it, but in that head of his was the one idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning came and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it sobriety. A shower</seg><seg type="columnLine">bath and hot coffee put</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in excellent shape for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day's work. His valet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had, as usual, gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his pockets, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectfully called his atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to a visiting card the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich man had brought home</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. At once Reis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick recalled the entire af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair, and with the direct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness that had made him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich man, he 'phoned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office that he would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be there till late, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started out on his search</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the speaker who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made such a disturbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Stanfield was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noyed at being roused</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a sound sleep by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">total stranger. He refused to see the man. This attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not last long. The stranger was insistent--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger was worse than that--he had stated bluntly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was simply going to stay there till he saw the Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that no one was going to make him leave. Realizing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the circumstances, that it would be better to get rid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him by seeing him, Dr. Stanfield sighed and wearily</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed to go down stairs. Once down there, and finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">who the visitor was, he thawed considerably. He even</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Reiswick that he was glad to see him and asked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to breakfast. Reiswick accepted the invitation and lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time in giving the reason for the early visit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What I want to know is simply this.

Most of these women</seg><seg type="columnLine">want children and cannot have them. So serious is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation that the lawyers of the country have at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">been talking about the wisdom of passing a national</seg><seg type="columnLine">divorce act which would allow an easy separation in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases of sterility.

As I understand it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the stars are from the families of the rich. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems that these are the families that are being largely</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected.

He married out there and, while he swears the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady is a pure Aryan, she seems a little dark, though she</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly is pretty. I have seen her once or twice when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she called at the office for her husband.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to ask a dozen questions, but realized that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best thing to do was to keep quiet till he found out what</seg><seg type="columnLine">his employer wanted. Finally Reiswick asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Why didn't you tell me that you had a baby?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did not know that you would be interested."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not interested? Do you realize that I am more inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested in babies now than I am in anything else in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world?

How does it feel to be a father?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It really is wonderful," replied the young man, smil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. "You see, there are not so many babies in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighborhood, and it has brought us into a lot of social</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominence. Lots of really fine people have called to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the baby and asked us to come and eat a meal with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bring the baby. Several men have offered to buy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little one for as much as a hundred thousand, but of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course we would not sell her for any amount. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she knows me already, and she is the most fun when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she is taking her bath. I only have a chance to play with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her at night and on Sundays. You see we are not rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to have a nurse and servants and so I help the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife a good deal. She does all her own cooking, knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to make a lot of eastern dishes that are really very</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine and not expensive either. Are you making this trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">just to see a baby, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just to see the baby, Smithson, and that is all. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to see a real baby and the first one I was able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate wTas yours. As you say, babies are scarce. It has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a long time since I actually saw a baby. In fact, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not remember when I saw a baby--real close.

At least that is what I have read in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old books."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another hour Mr. and Mrs. Smithson, John Reis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick and Susanne were entertaining each other in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathroom. Susanne was having her morning bath--</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather late--but then Mrs. Smithson said that she always</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept late. Reiswick just sat there and looked at the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. Finally, the rich man took a deep breath as he said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So, that is a baby?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">A TWENTIETH CENTURY HOMUNCULUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1015</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ■Til say it is," answered the proud father.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She is my child," said the beautiful dark woman, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very proud voice. "In my language I call her 'A Flower</seg><seg type="columnLine">from God!' " She took the baby out of the water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reis wick held out his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please let me hold her for a minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And there the little one lay, looking up with wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes at the big man playing with the golden football that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung from his watch chain. What passed between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby and the old football star was hard to say, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt it was a very important idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rich man and the young shipping clerk rode back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the office in silence. As they left the automobile Reis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going to double your salary.

As a result, the two men dined in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the millionaire's apartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''What I want is this," said Reiswick, "and I am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to beat around the bush. I want to be a father."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why not get married?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You told me this morning that if I did the odds were</seg><seg type="columnLine">against me. So why marry? I want at least an even</seg><seg type="columnLine">break in any game I play."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you could try it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too much gamble. I must be reasonably sure. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no time to spare. I want a child just as soon as I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">get one. I actually saw a baby this morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not marry and adopt that child ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not rich enough. The parents would not sell it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They love it too much. It is interesting.

I have to be sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In other words you want to be a father."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The important thing for you is not to have a wife but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have a child."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You should have lived a few hundred years earlier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At that time ladies were not looked upon with much</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor. Lots of scientists felt that the human race would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be much finer in every way if there was only one gender,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the masculine one. During that time there was a Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Paracelsus. Some thought that he was a quack and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then others were sure that he was a very wise man. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he were living today he might be able to help you, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, in one of his books, that he was able to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings without the help of the female sex. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">called these interesting children by the interesting name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of homunculis, and they were all men and all very bril-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">liant mentally. I happened to think of it and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the book with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop your nonsense.

Let me read you the exact descrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion which he has left to us. Here are his directions to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone who wants to follow them," and for fifteen min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes he read to Reiswick out of a very old, leather-bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">book. Then he closed the book.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He claimed that he made many of these little wise</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and sold them to the nobility of Europe for Court</seg><seg type="columnLine">advisors."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reiswick scratched his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not very well educated," he finally said. "I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the football course the four years I was at Columbia, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">frankly, the thing seems impossible to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It does to me, too," admitted Dr. Stanfield, "but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is this to say about it. Here is an exact description of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment in biology. We look upon it as an impossi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility but we have to admit that no one has ever dupli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated that experiment in this scientific age and actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out for themselves that it will not work. However</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is a man out in Chicago who is doing some inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting things with frog's eggs. He takes the eggs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritates them with a needle or with acid and every now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then one of them matures without being fertilized.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This man is a recluse but he has done a great deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">work in parthenogenesis. I met him once and did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know whether he was insane or just queer. Perhaps you</seg><seg type="columnLine">might induce him to do some work for you along the lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Paracelsus."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give me his name and address," said Reiswick, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly. "If money and science can give me a baby, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am going to be a father. You collect your fee from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">privatef secretary. I am off to Chicago on the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">train. If I go on the Pennsylvania I can fly from Cleve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land to Chicago and save some time. I would like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk more with you about this, but I am growing older</seg><seg type="columnLine">every minute and have no time to spare."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a most unceremonious manner he rushed out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining room and shouted orders to his valet. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Stanfield realized what had happened, he heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front door of the apartment slam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> OHN REISWICK was on his way to Chicago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hermopheles Jones was working at a low powered</seg><seg type="columnLine">microscope with frog eggs. One at a time he focussed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on them till he secured a perfect view and then with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very delicate needle he scratched the thin enclosing mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brane. Now and then he broke an egg, others he scratched</seg><seg type="columnLine">poorly. When he made a perfect mark, he smiled. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had decided to scratch fifteen hundred more eggs. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten of them survived the injury and started to grow he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be satisfied; if two kept on growing he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">delighted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime his wife was working as a seamstress to sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port the family, including her husband and two aged</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents. So far, there had been no children, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned biologist had been too much interested in frogs'</seg><seg type="columnLine">eggs to appreciate this fact. He certainly did not worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He may have heard Reiswick speak to him, but he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sign of it. It is possible that he felt a strong hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his shoulders, but he kept on working with the eggs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly, he felt himself lifted off the stool and forcibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumped down in a chair. Standing in front of him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great man demanded if he was Hermopheles Jones."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The biologist glared at his visitor, as he replied:</seg><seg type="columnLine">1016</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Yes, and you spoiled a perfectly good egg."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry about that. I will buy you another one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came all the way from New York to see you and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no time to waste. I want to be a father. I want a</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You let me go back to work. Are you insane? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't have any babies. Go to an orphan asylum."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dr. Stanfield of New York told me that you knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">more about eggs than any living man. Do you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Paracelsus ? Could you repeat his experiment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out whether he was telling the truth or not ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scientist beamed his joy. Rushing over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door he locked it and then returned to his visitor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some think I am insane," he confided, "and if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what I really think they would be sure of it. Para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celsus! Do I know him? Why, man, that old scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">is my God. I think that he was one of the most wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful biologists that ever lived. I have read and reread</seg><seg type="columnLine">his work and the only thing that has kept me from re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peating all of his experiments has been a serious lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of funds. Think how marvelous it would be! Life</seg><seg type="columnLine">without the female sex!! I have an idea that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a perfect world! Others can say that Paracelsus</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a charlatan if they want to, but I really believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was able to do all that he claimed to be able to do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now I have done a lot of work with eggs; I probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done more with frogs' eggs than any living man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I am too poor to work along the lines of that great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swiss."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have the money," said Reiswick, simply. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">much do you want ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So then and there they talked the matter over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Money can accomplish wonders. It is not surprising,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, to find that Hermopheles Jones was torn from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Chicago retreat. His family were amply provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">for in every way for a three-year period. For the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in his scientific life, the biologist was able to buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that he wanted to make a really accurate study</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the primary source of life--from the masculine view-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A small island in an isolated part of the Pacific Ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bought at a fabulous price from the French Gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment. On this island a small, but wonderfully com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete, town was built overnight out of houses brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">from San Francisco in sections. A colony of thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons, comprising every possible form of brains and</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor required for such an undertaking, was transported</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the States. In all of these preparations, John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reiswick took a leading part, as he was eminently fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to organize and direct any undertaking. In fact, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested several accessories to the equipment which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not entered the minds of any of the other members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">research group. One of these was a herd of goats with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an experienced goat herder. Another was a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital, fully equipped for all emergencies and especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to care for babies. Two graduate nurses were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken along to care for this hospital; also a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor to care for the health of the Colony and help</seg><seg type="columnLine">entertain the nurses. Reiswick wisely said that since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">final purpose of the expedition was to make him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, it would be well to be fully prepared to care for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the babies when they arrived. That was the real pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose of the hospital and of the herd of goats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rich man had so arranged his business that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be absolutely free from any responsibility for at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least three years. He wanted to have a real vacation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same time he was so accustomed to the conveni-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ences of a modern office, that at the last moment he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to the equipment an extra room fully furnished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve as his office, even to the stenographer, who was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be his private secretary. As this idea had entered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind but a few days before the ship sailed from San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco, he was unable to secure the services of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stenographer from his New York office and therefore was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to employ one from the city of the Golden Gate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He realized that there would be little business to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">transacted, but because he wanted to keep his mind occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied, he determined to follow out an ambition of years</seg><seg type="columnLine">and write three books, one a history of football, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">an account of the four years he had played at Columbia</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the third a prophecy of what would happen to foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball in the future, if the continued disuse of muscles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the increased use of machinery made men smaller and</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaker. He had devoted more time to sports in college</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he had to literary composition, and therefore in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">selection of a private secretary, he was careful to em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploy a young lady who was fully able in every way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assist him in the details of perfect literary work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO say that Ruth Stilson was a modern girl in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">way would have done her an injustice. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not gone through the world with her eyes shut but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had kept her fingers carefully crossed, and devoted her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to the perfecting of herself in her life's ambition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than to the following of the bright pathways of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-modern youth. All her life she had wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">write a book; as a child, she was always scribbling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper with a pencil; her study of stenography was a part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the preparation she made. In college, she majored in</seg><seg type="columnLine">English, and her old Professor openly stated that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a better idea of the correct use of the comma than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any student whom he had ever passed through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">classes. She was not beautiful but she was brilliant from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intellectual standpoint; she was not modern but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">never used the split infinitive; she did not live the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a flapper, but she adored watching her. In fact she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had composed a very serious essay entitled, "The Dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mite of Adolescence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was this very serious-minded young lady who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected, from over fifty applicants for the position, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be John Reiswick's private secretary. After talking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her for a few minutes, the ambitious man felt that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very safe socially, and at the same time would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkably helpful in the preparation of his manuscripts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She silently thrilled over the idea of three years on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropical island, as she felt that the quiet and leisure would</seg><seg type="columnLine">enable her to rewrite, and this time perfectly, her great</seg><seg type="columnLine">American novel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his usual flair for organization, Reiswick had</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlooked no detail of the community life. The ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangements for feeding the colonists were complete, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">two Chinese cooks served daily an abundance of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of oriental fruit and vegetables with an occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">young kid, fresh fish or tropical fowl. Everyone had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite work to do, and Reiswick had taken no one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not do his work perfectly and at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmonize with the other colonists. There was not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">work but amusement for all. Early in the history of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island a series of sports were arranged and a request</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued that each person spend at least two hours a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">in exercise. A six-hole golf course was built, and Reis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick himself taught swimming to all who were not pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficient in this sport. He felt that the only way for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">healthy mental life to continue on the island was to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">A TWENTIETH CENTURY HOMUNCULUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1017</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone in the best possible physical condition. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was easy with all except Hermopheles Jones and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three wild-eyed biologists, whom he had induced to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">his co-workers in this great lif e-ad venture. These four</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists would never have left the workshop had it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been for the insistent demands of the great American</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was spending several million in this biologic effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to become a father in the shortest possible time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reiswick had several serious conferences with Jones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The biologist, as is the case with many ultra-scientists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seem to comprehend the real urge behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spending of these millions of dollars. He showed this</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one of his remarks to Reiswick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I consider the hospital inadequate," he exploded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"In fact, the whole economic machinery is too small. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have conducted this experiment in a great city</seg><seg type="columnLine">where there would be adequate facilities for the care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds and thousands of babies at the same time. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">this experiment works at all, we are just as likely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have fifty thousand babies growing to maturity as we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have one. What should we do with them? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">good would thirty goats do ? By the time we imported a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship-load of milk, those perfect children of my skill</seg><seg type="columnLine">would die of hunger. Besides our laboratories are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">large enough, our glassware is inadequate. You should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have listened to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You do not understand my purpose," replied Reis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick, calmly. "I want to be a father, but I have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">special yearning to be the father of fifty thousand babies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, I feel that if I had just one I would be satisfied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially if it was a boy baby. That was one reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I was interested in the statement of Paracelsus. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the babies he made were males. Of course, if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">made fifteen at the same time and sent them all to Co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumbia at once and formed a Columbia-Reiswick football</seg><seg type="columnLine">team, it would be a rather fine performance, but I am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">as enthusiastic about football as I was, so I am not going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be disappointed if the baby you make for me is a girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long as she grows to be as beautiful a woman as my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother was. Of course, back of everything, is a desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do something towards preventing the human race</seg><seg type="columnLine">from going out of existence, but primarily I regard this</seg><seg type="columnLine">as purely formative experimental work of a very personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature. If you can make one baby, there is no reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">why you cannot teach the scientists of the world how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make babies in every large city, and in that way the race</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be preserved. Of course we may only be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make males, but perhaps they can get wives--in Burmah.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So you keep this in mind. I want to be a father, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not want you to overdo it. HI stop the whole work</seg><seg type="columnLine">and discharge you if you start turning out these babies</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a--like a--well, like a swarm of bees."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scientist threw up his hands in hopeless dismay as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what am I to do? Suppose we are successful</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we have a thousand babies in the first experiment?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you want me to kill them--these beautiful results of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my scientific skill?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My mother used to warn me never to cross a bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I came to it. So far you have not made even one</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby. In fact you tell me that you have not even started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a baby. You wait till you actually have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand babies and then you come to me and we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">decide what to do. We may pick out ten or twelve of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finest ones and concentrate on them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you are not going to let me grow fifty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I can?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly not! Think how it would make me feel to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the father of fifty thousand boys and some of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls! There are not enough names for that many. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to give them numbers and tattoo them to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them apart. Miss Stillson would have to devote all her</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to making a card index for them. Why, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to endow several universities just to educate my</seg><seg type="columnLine">children, and then--think of this. I am not the richest</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the States. There are others with far more</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth than I have, and when one of us starts a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">fad, they all enter into the most active competition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suppose it became known that I was the father of fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand children? At once three or four other men</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never be satisfied till they had a hundred thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand apiece and the large banking houses like Morgan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">might try to have five or ten million. It just would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. There might be an actual overproduction. That is</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I selected a desert island for this work and pledged</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one to secrecy. That is why I look over all out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">going mail. So do not be too rash in your enthusiasm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shall be satisfied if I have just one baby to call me</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Papa' and I am going to love it just as much if it is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl as though it were a boy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Reiswick returned to the office he repeated as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of this conversation as he could remember to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary. One of his reasons for having an office and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">private secretary was to enable him to keep an accurate</seg><seg type="columnLine">diary of the work of the colony. For this reason he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones dictate a daily statement of his progress. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course the work was so ultra-scientific and the language</seg><seg type="columnLine">used so pedantic, that no one could have any idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it meant, except an equally learned biologist, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reiswick wanted a record of the work to stand as a text-</seg><seg type="columnLine">book for other men in their efforts to keep the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">race from final dissolution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MORE and more Miss Stillson became interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the efforts that the big man was making to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">a father. She became so enthusiastic that she spent long</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours going over every detail of his ambition. She even</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried a little as he told her of the years which had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">without his even seeing a baby, and then of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill and deep longing that had come over him when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the little child of the Burmese woman in his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew then," he told her in the direct language that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was always in the habit of using, "that wealth makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">no difference and fame is at best a temporary gesture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ambition can be selfish. I found when I touched that</seg><seg type="columnLine">little baby, that after all, love is one of the great emotions</seg><seg type="columnLine">in life. Since my mother died I have had no one to love</seg><seg type="columnLine">me or to love--and it seemed to me that if I had a child,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would make life worth while. That is why I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">spending three millions of my money and these three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of my life here. Many of the colonists think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones is trying to make gold or a medicine to prolong</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, but what he is really doing is more valuable than</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold and makes life really worth the living. I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather be a poor man, like my shipping clerk, and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the love of a child, than be worth all of my millions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I remember it," remarked the secretary, "your</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipping clerk was married and this child of his was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural child, the result of the great love that can exist</seg><seg type="columnLine">between a man and a woman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, she was a Burmese woman, but very beautiful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were poor, but devoted to each other. It is peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">how attached people can be when they are in love with</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other even when they are poor. They had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">1018</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">servants and she did all the cooking in the oriental style.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said that he would rather listen to his wife talk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his baby coo than live in a fine hotel without them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then they were in love ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is what they said. I offered to buy the baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">but--nothing doing! Right then and there I made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind to have a baby of my own. I wanted to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">father."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you really believe that if Hermopheles Jones is</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful and makes a baby for you, after the method</seg><seg type="columnLine">described by Paracelsus, you will be satisfied ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe so. I guess so. Of course it would be nicer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have a baby--well, like my shipping clerk did--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best authorities say it is a great gamble nowadays. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">use their own language, 'An increasing number of women</seg><seg type="columnLine">are showing idiopathic sterility/ If I married, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no surety of being a father and I could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel enough to divorce my wife just because she hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to be unfortunate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you would appreciate a wife. The more I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, the more impossible your position seems. Take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair from the viewpoint of the child. That baby is</seg><seg type="columnLine">entitled to a mother just as much as to a father. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you going to tell the poor little thing when it grows</seg><seg type="columnLine">up? Now if you had a wife, she could mother the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby, even if it was of this peculiar Paracelsian origin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then when the baby grew up it would have parents in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of just a father. It would be like other children</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that would make it happier. Then there is the atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude of society. You disappear from your friends for</seg><seg type="columnLine">three years and when you come back you have a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby. How are you going to explain it ? Are you going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell your friends that it is a Paracelsus baby? They</seg><seg type="columnLine">will think that you are insane. But if you have a wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can simply say, 'This is our baby' and your friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">will say, 'What a lovely child. She resembles the father</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she has her mother's eyes/ Do you see? There</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no need of any awkward explanations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never thought of all that," answered Reiswick. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am a one-track man. All I can think of now is to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">a father. After I really have a baby, I suppose these</seg><seg type="columnLine">other matters will come to my attention and then I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal with them as the necessity arises."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some months he worked very hard on his three</seg><seg type="columnLine">books on football. As a result he saw a good deal more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ruth Stillson than he did of any of the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonists; in fact he saw more of her than he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any woman during his entire life--except his mother.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His secretary's intelligence made him envy her; her</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in his desires to become a father pleased him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ability to turn his dictation into beautiful English</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him determine that under no circumstances would</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ever permit her to work for any other man. In other</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, he fell in love with her and did not realize it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is, he did not know it till one day she was in swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming and was stung by an electric ray fish. She suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">so she became unconscious and Reiswick had to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ashore, where the Doctor worked for some time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">resuscitate her. During those anxious moments John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reiswick understood what it would be to be deprived of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her companionship for a lifetime instead of a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes of unconsciousness. He now realized what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following Sunday they were married by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Episcopalian clergyman who had been brought along to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look after the spiritual needs of the little colony. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out doubt this marriage was one of the most noted events</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">occurring on the island. The cook served a wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner, the ladies of the colony did their best to furnish</seg><seg type="columnLine">adequate floral decorations and combined all their ward-</seg><seg type="columnLine">robes to make the bride's wedding dress. Even the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">biologists were forced to take a full day's vacation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that came three glorious months of tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunshine and lovely night, illumined by the moon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars and melodied by the ceaseless throbbing of the surf</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the complaining coral strand. The longer John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reiswick and his bride lived together, the fonder they</seg><seg type="columnLine">became of the poetry of life, and the less interested they</seg><seg type="columnLine">became in football and the great American novel. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">times Reiswick even lost sight of just why they had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the regular semi-annual visit of the private</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer. The Captain brought confidential messages</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made the happy bridegroom go around with a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. There was danger of war being declared between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States and Japan. Of all the rich men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">America, Reiswick was the only one that wielded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful influence with the little brown men of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Orient. The President urged him to go to Japan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay there till a better understanding could be arrived at</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two great powers. It was a request that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be ignored and Reiswick at once saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only thing he could decently do was to comply with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">request. He dreaded to tell her, but he felt that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be wise for her to go with him. War might be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared at any time and there was the danger of subma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rines. To his surprise she was willing to remain on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island; it seemed that she was afraid of being seasick, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides, she felt that it was her duty to stay on the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">and look after his interests while he was away. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered that there was too great an investment there</seg><seg type="columnLine">for both of them to go and leave it. She ended her argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment by saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hermopheles Jones seems to feel that he is actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">making some progress. He is always saying, 'Time will</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell,' and is remarkably optimistic. If he really does pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce a Paracelsian baby in the next year, all the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for one of us being here to direct its care. So you</seg><seg type="columnLine">go, and come back as soon as you can, and take good</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of yourself, because I love you--and I am just go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to die if anything happens to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the end of the argument. Reiswick gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude of orders, a large amount of supplies was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded, and then the steamer slowly disappeared into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western seas. Ruth Stillson Reiswick cried. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not known that love could hurt a woman so much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SIX months and some weeks passed. Reiswick was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">go-getter. He had gone to Japan to stop the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk and promote a kindlier feeling between the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations, and he had finally succeeded. The Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emperor had decorated him with the Order of the Rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sun. The medal was a beautiful gold star, encrusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with diamonds, and when Reiswick first looked at it, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly realized what a wonderful plaything it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make for a baby. The word, baby, recalled the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the biological Jones and the lonely bride, Ruth, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so patiently waiting for his return, and, in the mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, looking so efficiently after his interests. Pie radioed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the President of the United States that all was right in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japan and that he was leaving to look after his personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">interests. Then he boarded his steamer and told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain to put all the steam on and beat it for the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He arrived at the lonely island just at twilight. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">A TWENTIETH CENTURY HOMUNCULUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1019</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain urged him to stay aboard ship till the next morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but he refused and ordered a boat to take him ashore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arriving there, he walked rapidly to his home. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no one there; there was no one in the office. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw lights in the hospital building, and went there. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of colonists were seated on the steps. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Preacher took Reiswick to one side and told him in grave</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones that Mrs. Reiswick was sick, but that everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being done for her that was possible. The excited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried man rushed into the hospital, but was told that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not see her; not now, she was too sick. He asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred questions to which no one seemed to be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">or willing to give him any satisfactory or definite reply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last he walked back to his office and sat down in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorite chair; the chair opposite him was the one his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife used to sit in when they were working on his booksr</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wondered how life would be if she never took any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more dictation? What had he done to deserve this?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why had fate made it necessary for her to die just when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had come back to her?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Hermopheles Jones came in. He seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">downcast as Reiswick. At the same time, he said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the experiments were going along all right and that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at a point where he might be able to announce suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess at any time. He said that at times he was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couraged ; it seemed rather hard to follow Paracelsus in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of his experiments, the language was ambiguous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at the same time they were making progress. Reis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick heard him as though a spirit were talking across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. Finally Jones said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have a drink? Will you take one if I fix it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. I am through with that sort of thing. Ruth</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not like it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he remembered that he should have said, "Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reiswick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They sat there through the night. Finally the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, as it does come in the tropics, with a great burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light, like a flower of the dawn, suddenly unfolding</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bud. Reiswick heard the sound of laughter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">confused voices, and wondered if the women were hys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terical. Great God! That was it. Ruth was dead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were coming to tell him and it was too much for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They were laughing and crying. She had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was not there with her at the last moment. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cruel of them to shut him out. A nurse came run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning into the room and in her arms was something in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket, and the white-gowned woman said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh! Mr. Reiswick and Mr. Jones. It's a girl and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finest you ever saw. What do you think of that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Jones? A baby on the island."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rich man was torn between emotions. His wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dead and, in spite of the pessimism of Jones the</seg><seg type="columnLine">biologist had produced a baby. Through his tears, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled at the little man and wrung his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I congratulate you," he said. "This will make your</seg><seg type="columnLine">name immortal. It was your brains and perseverance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that enabled you to show the world that Paracelsus was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to the nurse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take good care of this baby. See that it is neglected</seg><seg type="columnLine">in no way. Start the goat's milk according to the Doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor's orders. As soon as advisable I am going to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">her baptised, and I am going to call her Ruth after my</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor wife. You can all understand how I feel about this;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the success of the experiment leaves me cold; if it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened before the illness of my wife, I should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the happiest man on earth. Now please leave me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to spend a few minutes with my dead wife, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only woman who has loved me since my mother died."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They gathered around him and tried to tell him some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. He simply shook his head, like a stricken lion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst through them in his wild rush to the hospital. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurse slowly followed him, carrying the baby. Up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps and into the room that had the odor of chloroform.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Doctor blocked the door and the Doctor landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the hospital on the ground. Then, into the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reiswick went and fell on his knees by the bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eternity passed, and then he felt a hand straying</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No one should do that but Ruth!" he said and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reprimand the nurse, but he found that the hand was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruth's hand as was the wan smile. She was not dead at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. Not at all!! She had just been sick but she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">better now. Wonderful. Fine! Exquisite!! Ruth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was alive and Jones had a baby for them, a little girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby, And He Had Always Wanted A Girl Baby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am glad you came back," whispered the wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I came just in time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was the baby pulling you back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was God bringing me home to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you glad, Johnnie, about the baby?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I certainly am. Jones is to be congratulated. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">all working out nicely. You are going to get well and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the baby will have a mother."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's our baby."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You bet. That is what we are going to tell her when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she grows up. No use in her knowing about this Para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celsus stuff. How about it though? Shall I tell Jones</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go ahead and make fifteen or twenty more?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right now I think that one is enough," whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruth Stillson Reiswick. Her request was a command to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rich man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked up at the nurse who was holding the baby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You let me have that baby and you go and tell Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones I want to see him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In no time the biologist entered the room. Reiswick</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced him, and in the millionaire's arms the baby slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dr. Jones. You have done fine, and from what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen of this little baby, whom I am going to legally</seg><seg type="columnLine">adopt as my daughter, she comes very nearly being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">real fine child in every way. I congratulate you and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will see that you are kept in comfort for the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your life. If you want to, you can go ahead with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">studies. It may be that you can arrange with the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government to supply them with a hundred thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">babies, but, as far as I am concerned I am ready to stop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My wife and I have talked this matter over and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinks that even fifteen babies would be too many. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want you to dismantle the workshop. Everything ia</seg><seg type="columnLine">it belongs to you.

I had offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself as a martyr to science, and after a night of feast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and many toasts, I submitted to the Committee's</seg><seg type="columnLine">administering of a sleep-endowing drug. I knew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">naught until I was revived one year later, Aprilis a. 696,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a citizen of this United States, although he contended</seg><seg type="columnLine">that many years had passed.

Take heed, for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cask is under the seal of Julius Caesar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accepting the inscription at its face value, Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haskell immediately returned to his dwelling on River-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side Drive in the city of New York of this United States.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the trip homeward, he planned in detail the task</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my revival, and it was due to this careful advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought and to Professor Haskell's wonderfully trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, that I am alive today. Had someone of lesser</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentality made the discovery, I fear that I should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have survived to write this report.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jealously guarding his secret from all, the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the Cask placed in his private laboratory, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering the necessary equipment, he proceeded to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">me back to life. A week later, after I had fully re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered, he showed me the remains of the Cask and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained each step he made in effecting my revival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke first of removing the outer covering without</seg><seg type="columnLine">much difficulty, but was dismayed upon hearing the hiss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing noise as he punctured the second covering until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that it was only the releasing of the vacuum</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulation. He then noticed that the coating of frost</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the inner copper tank was becoming heavier, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly effected an opening large enough to admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Upon looking down, he was startled to see me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">full view lying within, since he expected to find some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other inner container. As will be remembered, the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serving oil in which I was immersed was of a clear straw</seg><seg type="columnLine">color and came from our deep well at the very low</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature; or of 126 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to the Professor's scale. These United States-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ians measured heat and cold in degrees and their freez-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing point was 32 degrees above zero. Thus, the Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor estimated that our oil was really 158 degrees below</seg><seg type="columnLine">freezing. He defined the oil as being a mixture of oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">and about 80 per cent of what he termed carbon dioxide</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas, with a small portion of helium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Haskell claimed to be very well acquainted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our low temperature oil of Rome, and he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was another oil-well which produced a similar mix-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture in this country at a place he called Jackson County,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colorado. The well in this county had been worked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">commercial use, the oil being heated by pipes of live</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam, until the substance was of an atmospheric temper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ature. I give this information to show that Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haskell was familiar with our fluid and knew the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions under which he was working.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unaffected by the shock of seeing my body in plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">view, the Professor immediately made a larger hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Cask and drained off the oil. Insulating his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands with heavy towels, Professor Haskell then re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved my body to a small cell where he had formerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept a large gorilla for experimental purposes. He then</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped me in what he termed electrical blankets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by carefully regulating the applied heat he brought my</seg><seg type="columnLine">body back to normal temperature. At the right moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he injected into my heart a drug known as adrenalin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which started pulsation and restored animation. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">did I again become alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is needless to state that, had not this United States</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">drug adrenalin been recently discovered and available,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had not Professor Haskell been acquainted with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">use, I should have perished in vain as soon as my body</seg><seg type="columnLine">had attained normal temperature. The Professor evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently felt very sure of himself, as he gave no thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of having violated the order of the Society of Roman</seg><seg type="columnLine">Medical Scientists and seemed to care not that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken the seal of Julius Ccesar when he opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reason for Professor Haskell's placing me in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small cell was soon apparent. He wanted to keep me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner until he had finished writing a book. Daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would visit me, and after supplying food and water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would question me for hours at a time. I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">no wrong in telling him of the wonders of our Rome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our manner of living, and of all the facts concerning</seg><seg type="columnLine">our great statesmen. In exchange, he taught me his</seg><seg type="columnLine">native language, called English. He was congenial in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every respect, but insisted that I remain confined in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell. After a month of this, I noticed him tittering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckling to himself at times, and I reasoned that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be going mad. He practically confirmed this view one</seg><seg type="columnLine">day when he boastfully declared that sweet revenge was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon to be his. He told me that he had nearly finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">his book and that it would revolutionize all history and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make his fellow scientists look ridiculous. I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had been liberated from the Cask by a maniac,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to be made a captive again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DAILY I watched for a chance to escape from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">.cell, but Professor Haskell was as crafty as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned, and always was careful to remain at a safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance, lest I reach him through the bars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The more I talked and listened to him, the more I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that he was on the verge of total insanity. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful brain had reached the snapping point, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly the fruits of mental over-development and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglect of physical exercise. In desperation I racked my</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain for a plan whereby I could obtain freedom before</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was too late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In order that my countrymen may know the condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my captor's mind and in justification of my later ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to obtain freedom, I shall cite a few examples of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idiotic statements Professor Haskell often made and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have me believe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would have it that the land and sea were round like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ball. I did my best to nullify this mad hallucination,</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeating to him time and again that we Romans have</seg><seg type="columnLine">long since known the world to be flat. I even told him of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who had been to the top of mountains and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved this flat-theory by viewing the straight line of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon. But all of this was of no avail as Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haskell was very set in his views, like all men of science</seg><seg type="columnLine">who have their own pet theories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He even went so far as to say that the land and sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved. The Professor thought that the sun was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less stationary and that it was the Earth that moved--</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything turning over during the night. This, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, caused the sun to appear to rise and set, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the land that actually moved. I assured him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was not the case, as I had frequently been up all</seg><seg type="columnLine">night on affairs with ladies, and although the land did</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to be a bit unsteady at times, it was nothing but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of drinking too much wine. I further assured him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had often watched shadows of our buildings slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawl across the promenade of the Forum, thus proving</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the sun moved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ICE MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1023</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Haskell was at his worst when he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have me believe that there was no Great Edge to the Sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">He contended that the water of the Sea bent around a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve. This seemed to be the most idiotic of all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">statements, save one, for it is evident to the most un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">educated person that water is always flat and level. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">could it be otherwise ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> According to the Professor, his United States was</seg><seg type="columnLine">around this bend from Rome, He claimed to know all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about our land and acted very superior when discussing</seg><seg type="columnLine">maps and countries. Nevertheless, I noticed that he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinually questioned me regarding our cities, the construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of our buildings and homes, and upon all matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning our Republic. This was very strange action,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, for one who was supposed to know as much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Haskell pretended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The most colossal falsity the Professor would have me</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallow, was that I am 2013 years old. He estimated that</seg><seg type="columnLine">our Parilia a. 695 was really what he termed April 21, 59</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Before his God was discovered). He claimed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present date was 1928 (After his God was discovered).</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowing my age was twenty-five upon entry, as I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him that was my age, he figured that I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">confined in the Cask some 1988 years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I believe that he was trying to beat down my spirit by</seg><seg type="columnLine">casting reflections upon my intellect. However, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not fooled nor would I allow my brain to become muddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his wild assertions. I could see for myself that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not aged physically, and by clever questioning, I se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured his admission that we were just finishing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter Season. Thus, as I had embarked last Spring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was easy to deduce that only a year had passed since I</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the Cask. I was not to be fooled simply because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States had their own trick calendar, a calen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dar based on the time they discovered that there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">God.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wondered what they would do when the discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there are many Gods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Haskell often admired my physical develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. He would stand and watch the knotting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunching of my rippling muscles as I daily disrobed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">performed the National Roman Calisthenic Drill. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am only physically equal to the average Roman citizen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was far superior to Professor Haskell; he being little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more in body than a well developed child. I finally con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived a plan whereby I could use his admiration for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength as a means of escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Striking a boastful pose, I called to him and offered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show how easily I could crush the back of a chair in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell. This started a little game in which he furnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">articles, such as sticks and beams, to test my strength.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cunningly I played the game until finally he unthinkingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered the article I long desired. It was a short piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal rod that he had used to open the Cask, He called</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a crowbar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With assumed difficulty, I bent the bar across my knee</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, with the right degree of aloofness, tossed it on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor within my cell. Soon after, Professor Haskell left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory and gave me the opportunity I had long</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Straightening out the crowbar, I reached through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars of the cell and used it to twist off the little lock that</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the door. To one who was familiar with the Roman</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever principles, it required little effort to destroy this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gathering my toga about the waist, I crouched by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall near the door and awaited the Professor's return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MY ever burning desire to forge ahead of the natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequence of events and blurt forth in loud acclaim</seg><seg type="columnLine">the many wonders of this newly discovered land, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States, has been hard to withstand. Roman Citi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zens, I can picture you standing in rapt attention before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Senate as my humble report is read from the ros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trum. Your eagerness to learn of the miracles I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">beheld is no greater than my desire to enrich your knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge. But I feel that I must continue in logical order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving each event as it happened, lest some may mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">construe the happenings which I later reveal. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I promise that your wait will not be in vain, when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear of my stroll along New York's thoroughfares.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While crouching near the door, I thought over a plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">of action. It was one whereby I could dispose of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor in the shortest time possible. I was eager to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have him out of the way and to be able to set out on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own, in quest of new adventures, for I had become weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sight of the four walls in which I had been held</seg><seg type="columnLine">captive for over a month. True, there were appliances</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the laboratory that I wished to learn more about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Professor had jealously withheld any information</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that regarding my study of English. But, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I felt that I must flee the confinement I had endured</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again breathe pure air with the sky overhead. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">month's imprisonment had given me the heart of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, and I had caught myself in moods of sympathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our galley-slaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last I heard the approach of footsteps. I tensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my muscles in readiness. My chance for freedom had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True to habit, the Professor opened the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode a full six paces before he realized I was not within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cell. I was upon him in a flash and bowled him over</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one blow. Quickly placing him in the cell, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted the crowbar around the door and made a much</seg><seg type="columnLine">better fastener than the flimsy padlock. Gathering my</seg><seg type="columnLine">toga about me, I fled through the door from which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor had just entered. I quickly mounted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the top of this stairs I encountered another door</seg><seg type="columnLine">that barred the way. It was a strong wooden panel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained within the edge was a new type of fastener,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite unlike the padlock of the cell. A small knob pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truded just below a little metal disc. It offered practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">no working area for any Roman lever principle that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have employed. I searched in vain for a solution</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the secret, straining against the panel with my strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. But the door was well made and withstood</seg><seg type="columnLine">all my efforts. I later learned that the door could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been easily opened with a small notched metal strip that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fits in the little disc above the handle. It was known as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Yale key and I was told that many young United</seg><seg type="columnLine">Statesians in the Yale school carried these keys. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were used for private apartments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Returning to the laboratory, I perceived that the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor had recovered consciousness. Straightway he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan begging for his release. I admired the Professor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve, but turned a deaf ear to his pleas, for I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he deserved a bit of his own medicine. I also gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to understand that the only thing that had restrained</seg><seg type="columnLine">me from twisting his neck was the fact that he had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cask and had restored my life. Nevertheless, I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve he realized that one should not imprison a Roman</seg><seg type="columnLine">Citizen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I searched the room for some other means of escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Professor Haskell watched me with his hawk-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">1024</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Evidently the laboratory had been constructed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cellar of his home, for I noticed that the walls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a stone composition and that two small windows were</seg><seg type="columnLine">up near the ceiling. They were closed by shutters on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside. While I was making this survey, my atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was attracted to the construction overhead. Small</seg><seg type="columnLine">boards had been used to make the floor above. Although</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cross beams between were of heavy wood, this board-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing above appeared to be of light material. I also</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted two long white shafts hanging a short distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ceiling. I later learned that these were heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes containing steam. They offered an ideal foothold</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a new plan that quickly came to my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the aid of a small box I was able to mount these</seg><seg type="columnLine">shafts. They felt soft and warm to the touch. In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner I secured a position on my back with my feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the small boarding above. Using my arms to as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sist the knee leverage, I was able to exert considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">force, and soon I had a few boards kicked loose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fastenings. Then it was comparatively easy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">push my foot through to the floor above and create an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening large enough to admit my body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Haskell made one last gesture to detain</seg><seg type="columnLine">me when he saw that I had met with success and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon be free. This last effort resulted in the finish of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant career as it was destined to cost him his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No doubt his act would have taken my life also, had I</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been well trained in the Roman art of leaping. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was perhaps best that he ended as he did, for I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced that he was totally insane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I suspected nothing when he asked that I hand him his</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfinished manuscript of history that lay on the table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He intimated that he might as well work in the cell until</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of his servants came and released him, I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from my perch in the ceiling to grant his last</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish. As I gave him his work he thanked me and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent to a low sigh. I now see that his sigh was in relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">over having his manuscript in a safe place, remote from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene of my intended extermination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I should have been suspicious when he tendered me</seg><seg type="columnLine">his purse filled with United States paper money. I well</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that men of science are not usually susceptible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passion of charity. However, I accepted his donation</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a form of Roman levy. It seemed natural for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">want me to have some funds when starting out alone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange land. I could not suspect his real motive;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of having me appear to be a dead thief, if his diaboli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal scheme had proved successful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I turned to go, Professor Haskell ventured that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could extinguish his little electrical stove on which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was brewing a bowl of brownish liquid called coffee. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to think that the coffee would boil over before</seg><seg type="columnLine">his servants came to his rescue. Although I was unfa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar with the mechanism of this electrical device, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to make the Professor as comfortable as possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt like a young husband ready to go out on a party</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a purse full of money and freedom in the offing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Any little whim the Professor had in mind was proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be granted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing that I fumbled with the electrical stove, he ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vised me that the best method of extinguishing it was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">immerse it in a pail of water. I could pour this from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large red container at hand. Eager to serve him, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured out the liquid. It was as clear as spring water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but had a pungent odor. I thought this was due to stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation. Little did I suspect that this liquid was highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive. It was called gasoline. A sudden desire to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry and quit the place made me toss the stove in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open pail from a short distance instead of immersing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as the Professor directed. This saved my life. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately the liquid flared up in a great flame that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have consumed me had I been standing over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pail. Leaping back, I was just barely able to clear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. Professor Haskell fell in a swoon when he per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived that I had escaped his fiery death trap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw at a glance that I just had time to make my exit</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the opening above if I hurried. I noticed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire was growing in volume, as I climbed quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloft. The spreading flames were igniting the oil that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been drained from the Cask. During the past month</seg><seg type="columnLine">this oil had been left standing in a huge open tub and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had resumed a normal temperature as all of the carbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">dioxide had escaped. The heat was terrific as the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames flared up like burning pitch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By a superhuman effort, I managed to crawl out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening and roll over on the floor above, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames began licking up through the hole. I lay for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant thinking of the Professor's fate. I would much</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather have had the pleasure of seeing him fed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions in our dear old Coliseum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a deep breath or two, I arose and wandered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through many rooms and passageways. Not a soul was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight and I finally found an outer door that opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a court in the rear of the dwelling. Unnoticed, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to run across this court. With a quick leap, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">scaled a high wall that surrounded the estate and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a small street. I later learned that this street was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only an alley. The streets of this United States are</seg><seg type="columnLine">great wide thoroughfares and even this alley was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide compared to our streets of Rome. Hurrying along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I soon came upon one of these spacious thoroughfares.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last I was free!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FREE at last on the streets of the United States! Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw nothing! As much as I would like to tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">Romans of what I first witnessed; as much as I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to know myself; verily I can remember nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looking back on my first few moments of freedom, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize that my mind did not absorb any of the many</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonders I must have witnessed. When I walked away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the inferno that I had started in the Professor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory, I was blind to everything but the path before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I had just tasted the first draught of a newly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered wine.....Freedom! A month's imprisonment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in Professor Haskell's cell, followed by my sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberation, had made me experience a new form of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toxication.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Freedom! Wine of wines! Freedom, a drink entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown to one who is a Roman Citizen. My blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingled in great ecstacy as I felt the fire of Freedom's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nectar; a nectar such as is sipped only in dreams. Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of Rome, I entreat you to try a taste of my new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">found vintage. Bind yourself as a slave unto a stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a month only. Mingle and work with the slaves, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the time is up, verily, I prophesy that you will en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy a drink many times worthy of your exile. Our best</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine, Nassicum, will seem like grape husks compared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this new quaff. You will, as never before, appreciate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom of Roman Citizenship. Have a little drink on</seg><seg type="columnLine">me!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have recalled one thing that came to my notice. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">street which I had chosen was as smooth as polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. But I might as well have been strolling on any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of our rough, narrow thoroughfares in Rome, for ail</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ICE MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1025</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">else I can recall. I could not even remember the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, should I happen on it again. Thus was the condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, at the next intersection, I was rudely</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened from my haziness. Terror filled my heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yea, terror! Even if I am a Roman Citizen! For I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">confronted with a fiendish monster. To my intimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends, that will sound as if I had become like a woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it is well known that I fear nothing mortal. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">bravery upon entering the Cask should prove my courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fearlessness. But I defy any Roman--yea, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mighty Julius Caesar himself, as brave as he is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">known to be.....to have stood in my place and to have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">felt other than afraid. I was alone, a stranger, a new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">born babe, in a land of seeming terrors and mysteries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wras encompassed by the unknown. I was confronted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a thing that had the broken unrealities of a phan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tasm. Hear me, as I tell of what I saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My eyes were on my pathway. I had nearly reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner. Suddenly bedlam broke loose. A piercing</seg><seg type="columnLine">eerie cry rent the air, an uncanny wail of rising cadences.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed to pour ice into my veins. At the same mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, a hundred bells started clanging. The crash of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand thunders roared about my ears. I looked up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see many Citizens scurrying from the streets. Chaos was</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking down the cross avenue, I beheld an ungodly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. A huge red land-monster was coming to recapture</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. In great lurching leaps and bounds it came directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me. It was as tall as two men and as long as a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. Two great eyes as large as the moon hungrily</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought me out from the crowd. Men were clinging to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sides of the monster, urging it on to greater speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a glance I saw another similar monster was immediate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly behind the first. Off in the distance others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">following.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning to flee, I saw that my path was cut off by still</seg><seg type="columnLine">others approaching from the rear. What chance of free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom, I thought, had one in a land where they send</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking red monsters lumbering after their captives?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I closed my eyes and awaited the end. My head was held</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect. My chest thrust forward. I stood like a true</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roman, unflinchingly awaiting death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But my time had not yet come!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a thundering roar that made the very' ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon which I stood tremble, the monster swept past me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Opening my eyes I was just in time to see the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster pass. I gave vent to a low chuckle of relief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For I saw that my fear was groundless. Again I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">true Roman who laughs when close death is thought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have passed. I saw that w'hat I had thought were huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">red land-monsters, were only fire-fighting machines used</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the United States. Their piercing cry and clanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">bells were only to clear the path. My recapture was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted. Again I laughed to compose myself, for verily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will admit I was afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noting that the machines had stopped a short distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the street, I hurried along to examine them better.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And what marvels I beheld. They were a sort of chariot</seg><seg type="columnLine">.... a four- or six-wTheeled chariot. And the most amaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing part was that they had moved at terrific speed with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the aid of horses. Pails, axes, ladders, bells and</seg><seg type="columnLine">great sections of fiber pipe adorned the chariots in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very decorative manner. Numerous special fittings</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistened like polished gold. At the forward end was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">device that propelled the machine in place of horses. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was called the Engine. It breathed in loud, puffing snorts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was this noise that I had first thought was thunder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This snorting and blowing was cleverly controlled by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in charge. The Engine was used, even when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine was stationary, to blow water through the fiber</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes with tremendous force. The other end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes was then directed on the fire, the water shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in great fountains. The two large eyes as big as</seg><seg type="columnLine">moons wrere great lanterns. They were used to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">out piercing beams of light whenever the chariot traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night. The entire body of the machine was painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a violent red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Great was the admiration of the United States Citi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zens for their fire-fighting chariots. A vast throng had</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly gathered to witness it in operation. A stout</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope was immediately stretched waist high across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street to hold back the surging multitude. A large black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered horseless-chariot brought a squad of ushers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene. They immediately began their duties of keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the crowd behind the rope. These ushers were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">important individuals, whose sharp, nasal voices bespoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">of earlier training as auctioneers or fish merchants. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know now that they were the city guards, called Cops.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had occasion later to know them intimately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly there was a loud explosion across the street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smoke and flames burst from every window of a mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificent stone castle. I realized that this was Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haskell's dwelling and that I was the one who had started</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire. I stood in awe, watching the great billows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke and streaming tongues of flame as they leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">skyward. Professor Haskell must have kept other ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosive liquids in his laboratory, and the fire had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little time to reach them. However, the flames were</seg><seg type="columnLine">enveloping the entire building and reminded me of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vesuvius.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strange to relate, the men in charge of the fire-fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines gave no heed to the burning building. Instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">they directed their streams of w*ater on the adjoining</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses, which were not burning at all. This seemed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very queer way to put out a fire. But I reasoned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men must have had a certain system of procedure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I did not feel called upon to offer any advice. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps they also knew the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Realizing that the house would be a total loss and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything in it would be consumed, I slowly withdrew</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the front ranks. I tried to attract as little attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible for I knew that if I w'as suspected in the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should be subjected to severe questioning. Even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt that I could cope with any inquiry that might</seg><seg type="columnLine">arise--for I have had much training in the art of Roman</seg><seg type="columnLine">evasion--I perceived that my task would be very diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult, as the last shreds of my identity must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliterated in the fire. Little did I then realize that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should later wish that I had stepped forward and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself known. Some evidence might have then been</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved. But at the time, I gave no thought to this. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">sole idea was to place as much distance as possible be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween myself and the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS I strolled away from the conflagration, I began see-</seg><seg type="columnLine">. ing so many wonders at once that it is hard for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to set them" down in any order of recognition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have said that I was in the United States. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, but I was also in the largest city of this country--</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. I have long since learned, from contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the many natives of this New York, that it is the only city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any consequence. However, there are a few other</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities out in a part of the country known as the Sticks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1026</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hereafter, I will speak of Being in New York, and it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be understood that I also mean the United States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On my right was a large river named the Hudson. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like our Tiber River except that the boats did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have any sails. While some of the vessels were small</seg><seg type="columnLine">and similar to our war-barges, there were also others of</seg><seg type="columnLine">great size. These massive ships carried many passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were called Ferries and Steamers. I thought these</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be the biggest ships human hands could construct,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I later witnessed a marvelous colossal floating city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge ship made entirely of metal and as great in size</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a whole section of Rome. As I said, none of the ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sails. They were all propelled by an Engine similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that of the fire-fighting chariots. In fact, the Engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">wras one of the most wonderful and useful inventions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this land. It was used in almost every conceivable man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner whenever energy or power was required.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I suspect that scores of Roman citizens are already</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubting my word, for I know that it is hard for one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that there could be any ships as large as I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned. It must be equally as hard for you Romans</seg><seg type="columnLine">to picture a little metal Engine doing the work of thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of horses. But I swear on my honor as a Roman</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizen that these truths are just as I have pictured them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pray treat my report with an open mind, for even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic things are yet to come--Ships that fly, Elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity, Radio, Pictures that move and talk, Subways--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but wait, I must not go ahead of my story. I only hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it will be remembered that I have investigated every</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about which I write. I have fully recovered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my first fear of the supernatural. I no longer look upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire-fighting apparatus as land-monsters. I am counting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the belief of you men of Rome, who saw me placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Cask, for I am now in bondage again, because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens of this great New York will not believe that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived in that manner. These people who have created</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbelievable wonders are quick to doubt a lesser wonder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They call me The Ice Man because I tried to tell them</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was frozen in the Cask for a year. The Cops have</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but, again I am wrandering from my report. Oh, if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were only the Great Cicero! If I could only tell my</seg><seg type="columnLine">story in logical order! But I am only Marcus Publius,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you Romans will have to make allowances for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapses. I will try again to stick to my report.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was turning away from the river when I beheld the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next wonder. Suddenly a strange buzzing noise fell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ears. It was like the whirling drone of a giant bee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looking towards the sky from which the sound came, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">beheld five huge birds flying in wedge-shaped order.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even at their great height I saw that the birds were of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange species, unknown to me. Their peculiar droning</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzz beat upon my ears like staccato thunder. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked, they began to .fall. In a series of fluttering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning spirals they came, until I thought they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed on the ground. But even as I watched, they re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained their equilibrium and skillfully glided down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">skim across the river. I held my breath in wonder as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they gracefully came to rest on the water's smooth sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. I stared in open-mouthed amazement over their</seg><seg type="columnLine">great bulk and wondered how such gigantic birds could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been caught and tamed. Looking closer I beheld a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight that nearly swept me off my feet. A citizen was</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually emerging from the bird's mouth. I could hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe my eyes. More citizens came forth--six in all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They gleefully waved to passengers on a passing ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last it finally dawned on me that I was witnessing</seg><seg type="columnLine">another strange marvel of this New York. Inventions</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Gods! The huge birds were great man-made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flying-ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw that the flying-ships were shaped very much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bird in full flight. The wings did not fold up, but re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained stiffly outstretched, even after the flight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. A large wind-mill had been placed in the nose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the device. Another of those Engines was used to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">this wrind-mill at great speed; the force thus sucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying-ship through the air. These flying-ships were</seg><seg type="columnLine">called airplanes. There were no feathers on the devices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning away I made a vow that I would seek a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight in one of these airplanes at the first opportunity. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked along in deep thought, wondering over the pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibilities of an early return to Rome in an airplane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What a greeting I would receive when I glided down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the surface of the Tiber. I would be a hero. Nay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hero of all times. With my private airplane I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead great armies on to new victories. With a load of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones, I could easily conquer the strongest cities. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be made king! Ladies would flock to me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">droves; riches and luxuries would be mine for the ask-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. My poetry would rival Virgil's. Ha! such is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of thought. Verily, what Roman would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">let his mind run astray in the midst of such super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geniuses of invention as these New Yorkians? Yea, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am a Roman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I continued my walk. On my left hand were large</seg><seg type="columnLine">castles where one of a select four hundred persons</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived. There were four hundred such castles like these</seg><seg type="columnLine">in New York, each housing one of this same select four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred. A short distance away were the towering</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwellings of the more common people. The common</seg><seg type="columnLine">people had to live four hundred in one house. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings were constructed much the same as ours, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept that they rose to dizzy heights. High rents also</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevailed here, as in Rome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The streets were filled with long lines of swiftly mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing chariots or carts. They were luxurious affairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaudy and brilliant in highly polished colors. The ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressions on the faces of the occupants bespoke the pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their owners. Again, the Engine was used to propel</seg><seg type="columnLine">these glorious chariots along the glistening streets. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of the outer edges of the wheels being bound in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hides or leather, as are our chariots, they were covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a smooth-fitting fabric rim. These rims contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">air under pressure. The fabric was called Rubber and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was another wonderful discovery of this land. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Engine, it had been put to many uses, and because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its flexibility and water-shedding quality, it was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">great value as a cloak in the rain. This Rubber could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made either soft or hard and was manufactured into</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of different articles for daily use throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States. Later on, I found that the Rubber</seg><seg type="columnLine">was made into little sticks, five to a package. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens chewed these little sticks as they strolled along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No doubt the idea came from the cow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER a glance around the horizon, it was perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural that I, a Roman, should next be attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by New York's native females. Yea, and what an</seg><seg type="columnLine">attraction!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My friends in Rome will vouch, that while I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">delved deeply into scientific matters I have, with all other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Romans, not neglected the physical. Although I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not considered a connoisseur of women, I have had my</seg><seg type="columnLine">little moments. For I am a Roman. I dare say that any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my fellow countrymen would have been likewise en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ICE MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1027</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thralled should they have witnessed the enchanting crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures that I beheld. I must control my emotions as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">write, lest I overdo the thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The main attraction of these New York ladies was</seg><seg type="columnLine">their style of dress. However, their faces were also</seg><seg type="columnLine">very beautiful to look.upon, when one took occasion to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look. But their costumes were the main enticement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each and every one was clothed in a single short gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that fell to a point just above the knees. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the knees. ... I swear to it! This garment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of a glossy shimmering fabric and clung to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapely bodies as if the owners had just been immersed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the river and were walking along dripping wet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slippery. The legs of these fair creatures were clothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a similar fabric but of much thinner texture, that ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually being possible. It was like looking through wisps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wind-blown cobwebs. This shimmering fabric was</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Silk. It was made in various hues and shades and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was truly a godsend to womankind, for it was even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">appealing than the nude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stood still for a moment, my heart filled with rapture</seg><seg type="columnLine">over seeing such a wonderful parade of treasures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These lovely creatures strolled along apparently ignor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant of the fact that every movement was clearly defined</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the twitching of the Silk. I thought of the feast this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight would be for those friends of mine back in heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">swathed Rome. Even dusky Egypt had nothing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a chuckle of glee, I thought of you Romans hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to be content with watching the damsels meander</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Forum in their concealing Pallas and Stolas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ah! but here in New York a slight gust showed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions above the knee. Verily, the dress of the ladies</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of the most revealing sights of this great New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My past experience with the fair ladies of Rome had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught me that beauty of the face did not necessarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue under the Palla. Here in New York there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt whatsoever. For a man could really trust his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thinking that I would enjoy the companionship of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of these fair exhibits, I straightway tried to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquaintance of the next beautiful lady who passed. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">my surprise, my only reward was a baleful glance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">disdain. By no means discouraged, I approached many</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, some even more beautiful than the first. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rebuffed at every turn. While some of the ladies</seg><seg type="columnLine">did smile and giggle, the net result was anything but</seg><seg type="columnLine">complimentary to one who had always considered him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self a first-rate Roman lover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I reasoned that perhaps my mode of dress was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tasteful to them. It must be remembered that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in our native Roman garb and that I was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">different in appearance from the rest of the men in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York. Although my toga displayed my strong, manly</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms to good advantage, it was entirely unlike the male</seg><seg type="columnLine">attire of this land. The New York male garments were</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an unusual pattern. However, they were very pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the eye and made a practical mode of dress for</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who rushed about in a great hurry. The upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of this costume consisted of a short, tight-fitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket with long sleeves that entirely concealed the mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles of the arm, if there were any. The lower portion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the garment consisted of two long loose tubes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were joined at the waist. They were called pants. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">pants were ideal for hiding undeveloped legs, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave no hint whatsoever as to what they concealed. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wide effect at the bottom lent a very substantial appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance to the wearer. I resolved that I would postpone</seg><seg type="columnLine">my campaign with the ladies until I could procure similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiment for myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time, it struck me as queer that my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">attire had attracted little or no attention. There I was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolling about the streets of New York clad in my na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive Roman Toga, with my Tunica underneath, but all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attention I aroused was a casual glance here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Had one of the New Yorkers been in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">position in Rome, he would have been an object of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest for the multitude. But here in this country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where men pay little heed to the dress of their women--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is, compared to my interest--what could be expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their notice of a man's garments?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ANOTHER peculiar thing I noticed at that time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">jTIl that most of the men were eating smoke. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke was obtained by sucking on a small fire at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer end of a short white stick which was carried in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. I later learned that these white sticks contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar weed known as Tobacco. The sticks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Cigarettes. I have since tried to use: one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, but the smoke always got in my lungs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently the art of eating smoke could be learned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, for every male in sight had a little cloud of smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his head. Even the females smoked while riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their chariots! But my own personal opinion was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cigarette had been over-spoken. As in Rome, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">things in New York had secured followers by being</seg><seg type="columnLine">over-spoken. They called it advertising in this country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh, yes, another thing! All the male citizens wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd-shaped helmets. They looked like small inverted</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowls and some were folded or creased at the top. I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not particularly notice the ladies' headgear. However</seg><seg type="columnLine">I distinctly remember that their shoes were pushed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rear on slender peg-like stilts. This gave an ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of smallness even to large feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Speaking of the ladies again reminds me that the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the males were equipped with two small windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of transparent glass. The glass was not unlike our</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass . . . from which we make our small perfume</seg><seg type="columnLine">flasks . . . excepting that it was so curved as to magnify</seg><seg type="columnLine">the objects of vision. The little windows, held in place</seg><seg type="columnLine">by two long hooks that fastened over the ears, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the head as the eyes were focused from one lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the next. This was the reason the men appeared not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be looking at the ladies. Only one glance was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired to bring the magnified beauty before their eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verily, I yearned for a pair of these little windows for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own use. Even one or two of the ladies wore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">device, although these ladies were of the older type.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looking for a desirable husband, no doubt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I next beheld some of New York's wonderful build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. They were of tremendous height and faced close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the edge of the street. Nothing will ever stir me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">did my first sight of these colossal structures. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheer walls of a mountain defile they towered to un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">believable heights. Their topmost points seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrape the clouds. Ye Gods, what an awful mess there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would certainly be if one of them ever toppled over!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, as gigantic as the structures were, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacked the grace and beauty of our Roman buildings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a marked absence of any columns or arches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their walls were straight and flat, though pierced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">many hundreds of windows, and the whole unit looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">1028</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like a vast pile of .stone blocks. True, there were some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the low buildings that had a few columns in the front,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and here and there a small arch graced an entranceway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the great majority of them were built on the ugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Egyptian style of the obelisk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was glad to see that wt Romans were very far in ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance of these New Yorkers in the art and the beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of architecture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One or two of the buildings were in the process of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being built, and I had an opportunity to discover a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of marvelous inventions that were in common use in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this land. Only a few men were at work on the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, but I was able to gather much information from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">large crowd watching the construction. The builders</seg><seg type="columnLine">were experts at their trade as the structures were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted in a very short space of time. However, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchers were also experts and they often argued among</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves as to whether the workers were doing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">job right or not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The skeletons of the buildings were made of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams of metal known as Steel. This Steel was a metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to our iron. In fact iron-ore had been heated</seg><seg type="columnLine">until all impurities and sulphur had passed off. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exact amount of carbon and other secret ingredients</seg><seg type="columnLine">were added to produce the required strength of Steel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Steel was very strong and almost as hard as some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our copper. I was later gratified to learn that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">Romans were also far in advance of these New Yorkers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the matter of hardening copper. Oh, there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt but what these New Yorkers had some wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventions and tricks. But I never lost sight of the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we Romans had a trick or two ourselves. One or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of the natives did not care to hear about this, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">refrained from bringing it up during the rest of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation on building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great Steel beams were lifted into place on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeleton-work by flexible Steel ropes. These ropes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to devices such as our pulley-system and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulling was done by another of those Engines. It ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared that almost everything in New York was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Steel or Rubber and was called a Machine and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">run with an Engine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Great Machines mixed concrete, made with our Roman</seg><seg type="columnLine">cement, and poured it into wood frames built around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel beams. This method had quite an advantage over</seg><seg type="columnLine">our method of hand-mixing concrete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We should have been greatly assisted in constructing</seg><seg type="columnLine">our great Aqua Marica if we had had one of those mix-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Machines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One other thing these New Yorkers had learned better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than we Romans ever did, was the art of manufacturing</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass in great sheets. I was informed that they rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass instead of blowing it. These immense glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheets were placed on the front of the building to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the citizens from stealing the various pieces of merchan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dise on display.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of a sudden I realized that I had not eaten since</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. Professor Haskell had given me some food</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the third hour, but in the excitement of my escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of seeing so many wonderful sights, I had forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about eating again. Seeing that is was nearly sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set or at least the eleventh hour, I hunted for a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I could purchase food with the paper money from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor's purse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My nose soon-directed me to a place from which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell of cooking was issuing with a very noticeable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreeable aroma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A LARGE sheet of glass covered the front of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating place and enabled one to whet his appetite</seg><seg type="columnLine">from watching others eat. Upon entering, I first noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long row of discs that were mounted on short ped-</seg><seg type="columnLine">estals. On these discs were perched many citizens and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it reminded me of my pet monkey. For the citizens all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat to eat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unlike us Romans, the New Yorkers have yet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn how much the stomach suffers when one tries to eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a seated position. Some day these people will learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a reclining posture, when one is dining, minimizes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strain on the organs. Some day they will learn that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throat muscles were intended to force the food into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stomach. They will learn of the necessary gland -</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluids that are to be mixed with the food as it slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">passes along the throat. Watching their animals eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">would tell them that. How these people could stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shock of dropping food and drink directly into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomachs was more than I could understand. What, writh</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating while seated and with eating smoke, it was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder all New Yorkers looked so frail and sickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Approaching a counter that separated the discs or</seg><seg type="columnLine">stools from the rest of the place, I encountered a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful damsel. She wore a fetching blue and w'hite</seg><seg type="columnLine">costume and must have been the proprietress. She gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a glass of water and a card and with a damp cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">she wiped a brown stain from off the polished counter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I demanded meat, bread, and drink . . . any wine she</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have, would do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fair lady gave every indication that she thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was intoxicated. At last my difference of dress was</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed. She asked me if I had not been in a "joint."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And she wanted to know what kind of a place it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they sent a "guy" home in a sheet. My friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile put a stop to any further questions and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightway brought forth victuals. Three or four metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating-implements were also served with the food. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I chose to spend no time learning the use of these tools,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I was very hungry. Besides, nothing will ever be</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented that would improve on our good old Roman</seg><seg type="columnLine">style of eating with the fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All would have gone well had I not forgotten myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to recline on the tops of those stools. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">discs revolved with lightning speed and I fell to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. This act caused me no little discomfiture and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave reason for considerable mirth to those assembled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My head had received a good sound thump on the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, and I must have staggered a bit when regaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">my perch. This settled all doubts of my sobriety in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds of my associates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a measure, my seeming intoxication proved fortu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nate. For the fair attendant or proprietress became very</seg><seg type="columnLine">solicitous regarding my feelings. I soon gianed her con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to an invitation to show me the city. I told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was a stranger in New York. I then quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed her my full purse and thereby overcame her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fears that I had been robbed and was penniless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was overjoyed at seeing my great wealth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said that I could come back for her after an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed. However, she was firm on the point that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must first purchase suitable New York clothes. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me to procure them in a place around the corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Broadway Street. I was cautioned to remember that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could find her in this Restaurant which was on Seventy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">second Street. She wrote the address down on a piece</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of tissue E- Restaurant, 72nd and BHvay, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">signed her name. It was Kate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ICE MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1029</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I stepped outside of the Restaurant I beheld one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most wonderful sights I had ever seen. Miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of miracles! Oh, what a sight for one who had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">been accustomed to the dark streets of Rome at night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here in New York the night-time was brighter than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. Thousands of brightly illuminated globes flooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street with light. Hundreds of these small globes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were grouped in weird scrolls and designs that spelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out letters. Each letter flickered off and on in rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">succession. It made me think I had stepped into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairyland. Try to imagine each star in the heavens a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred times brighter! Tint them the colors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainbow! Arrange them in patterns like the mosaic</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our Temple of Venus and Roma! Twinkle them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and off! Whirl them around like a thousand comets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, my Romans, you will have a vague conception of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I witnessed on Broadway Street at night in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful city of New York. This was called Elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Electricity! Electricity was that "something" that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made all of these little globes shine so brightly. Elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity was the force that gave these New Yorkers light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat, power, music . . . everything that was wonderful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ah, but what it was and even whence it came, not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizen in all the land could tell. Nor did anyone know!</seg><seg type="columnLine">All they knew was that they had it . . . that they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it to work. I know that this will sound very silly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all Romans. For we Romans will never rest until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have solved every perplexing mystery. But such</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the state of ignorance of the strange people in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">very strange land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I ENTERED the clothing establishment which Kate</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told me I would find. It was maintained by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Israelite. With both hands he sold me an outfit such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I desired. It was called a Nifty Suit. I was also sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied with the New York type of footgear and under</seg><seg type="columnLine">garments. I was delightfully surprised with my appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance in the large mirror that the Israelite had strategi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally placed near his cash box. How I wished that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">countrymen could have seen me!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kate was also delighted with my costume when I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned for her at the Restaurant. She spoke of me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">being, her "Warm Daddy." Almost everything had some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of heated temperature in this New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kate further remarked that I looked "swell," although</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not see that my new costume had made me look</seg><seg type="columnLine">any fatter. I later learned that most of Kate's language</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very different from the English I had learned from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Haskell. The real New York language was</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of tricks and I soon learned that the Professor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">out-traded me. Instead of teaching me the native New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York tongue, in exchange for my information on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things of Rome, he had taught me a foreign language.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, if I raised my eyebrows, the New Yorkers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were able to understand me, but I could not comprehend</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-half of the things they said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Other languages have many words with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning. But this New York tongue had many meanings</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the same word. Their word "CAN" was a good ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample. This word "CAN" could mean: to be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do; a small bucket; to discharge one from his job; an</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobile; the act of preserving; a men's retreat; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, as when one was "off his can;" the middle rear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as when one was "knocked on his can"; dismissal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's sweetheart; to rush the purchase of beer; to tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment a dog; and as an "oil-can" it could mean either</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an oil-container or just as easily one's brother-in-law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kate also spoke the language of the eyes, and in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">art she was a fluent speaker. Her eyebrows were little</seg><seg type="columnLine">penciled lines, but they made up in movement what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacked in hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kate led me to a commercial chariot called a taxi.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riding in it was like skimming through the air while one</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat on a bed. Our Roman chariots are very poor riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared to these smooth-running taxis. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very fortunate in having selected the one taxi in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York that had the right-of-way privilege over</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody else. After pushing aside one or two other</seg><seg type="columnLine">chariots that would not recognize this authority, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at one of the brightest places I have ever seen. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the place where Forty-second Street made a crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Broadway Street. Kate said that it was the Times</seg><seg type="columnLine">Square, but I thought that it had been tnany times</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kate enjoyed my amazement over the bright lights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stood off at a little distance so that I could look</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fill. Taking me by the arm, she then led me to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">even brighter spot--the brilliant, dazzling white entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one of New York's cathedrals of amusement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A soldier of high rank guarded the entranceway of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this gorgeous cathedral. He wore an elegant uniform</seg><seg type="columnLine">and must have been of the rank of general. Harkea unto</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, Noble Romans; during the night would be an ideal</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to capture this country, as all of the soldiers are</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed on guard in these amusement halls. They are so</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed to hold the citizens in awe, so that each and every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one will line up and pay the admission toll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of the art and beauty that the New Yorkers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">omitted from their tall buildings had been lavishly ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied to the interior of their amusement cathedrals. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are on a par with our Roman interiors. Just inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway stood two or three soldiers of the ranks. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dressed in uniforms of brilliant hue and they stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite stiff, lest they wrinkle their garments. Stationed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the hall were many more of these soldiers. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no lances or spears, but one could readily see from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expression on their faces that they would not be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quered without giving strenuous battle. However, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were such small, sickly looking soldiers, I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could have conquered a dozen of them at one time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Magnificent tapestries covered the high walls. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapestries were made of the silk material and figured</seg><seg type="columnLine">with golden dragons whose serpentine bodies shimmered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gleamed in the many-colored lights. A gorgeous</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpet covered the entire floor and this, too, was fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned with golden dragons which seemed to glare at me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fiery eyes as I stepped deep into their soft bodies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huge vases and odd pieces of furniture with dragon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet stood at intervals along the walls. Great lamps</seg><seg type="columnLine">that looked like suspended waterfalls hung from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">domed ceiling. One was swayed with the colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxury and lavish grandeur of the place and I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of being smothered in gorgeousness. I was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a place called the Movies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kate and I were finally led to seats in a dark audi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torium. On one wall, facing the seats, was a large pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture? Why all the fancy trimmings for only a big black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our seats, I wondered why all of the lavish art dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">play had been made on the outside of the auditorium?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why could they not have put some inside with the pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture? Why all the fancy trimmings for only a big black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-white picture ? And then I saw! I heard!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The figures in the painting moved . . . they came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">1030</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">life . . . they talked .. . and it was only a picture! Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">that breath-taking fright of the supernatural swept over</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I swear on my honor as a Roman Citizen that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fully conscious when I witnessed this miracle. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only did the figures in the painting move and talk, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the picture grew dim and faded into another new scene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still other scenes appeared, more figures came forth . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">until a whole story was unfolded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could not explain this mystery any more than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could explain Electricity. It was a form of amusement</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose origin was a secret. The citizens were allowed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at the picture only while it moved. When the ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion ceased a curtain was dropped in front of the paint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. A squadron of musicians was pushed up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cellar to keep people from mounting the stage, lest</seg><seg type="columnLine">they discover the secret of the moving and talking within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the painting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOON afterwards a new painting appeared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed citizens playing ball, a game very similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our Roman pastime. The only difference was that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Yorkers played on a diamond plot, instead of on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tViangle, and they used twelve players at one time instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our three.* However, three of the players were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in blue uniforms and seemed to be the best play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers of the lot. For they kept telling the others what to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do to improve their game. One selfish player in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center, who probably owned the ball, made all the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait until he felt like playing. Naturally, the other play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers did not get very much exercise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I noticed that one player carried a stick for hitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball. But at the time the picture was painted, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow with the club was a poor selection. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not send the ball to the rest of the players. He even</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked the ball over the fence. Finally, in anger, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran all around the plot and quit. The witnesses jeered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on to a little hole in the wall. They teased him by</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling him a "Big Baby." They also called him "Ruth,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feminine name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the ball-game painting faded out, the lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">flared up and I had to release Kate from my embrace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We left the auditorium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kate proved to be a really wonderful girl. She seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have caught the spirit of the occasion, for she tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show me everything that she thought I would consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual or mystifying. I had informed her that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not acquainted with many things in New York which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were common affairs to anyone else. She had deduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">this in advance and thought it not unusual as I had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently arrived from Rome. She said that there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many strangers and foreigners in New York. In fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had personally met many of my own countrymen</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been in this land for some time and who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">then in the fruit and. shoe-polishing profession. Kate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the Professor, spoke of knowing all about our city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Rome and declared that our citizens were well known</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in New York. She admitted that they all were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of knowledge. For, most of them were struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumb with the strange sights they had beheld. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that all Romans were called Wops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I secured her promise that on the morrow I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet these fellow Romans. Undoubtedly they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of our sailors whom we had given up as lost over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Great Edge of the Sea. I cannot blame them for</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wanting to return to Rome after having discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">this wonderful United States and New York City. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a very attractive port for any sailor. What,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with these New York ladies parading around the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in their swaddling clothes, together with all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wonder of this strange land, it would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">very easy for a Roman sailor to forget that he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife back home. Especially would it be so, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the wife believed him lost at sea!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stopping in front of a brightly lighted shop, Kate</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked me if I would like to talk over the telephone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen to a Phonograph and Radio. I assured her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">such was my fondest desire, for I had visions of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering another darkened auditorium where Kate could</seg><seg type="columnLine">again snuggle close in my arms. However, the darkened</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreat was not forthcoming as she instead guided me</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a brightly lighted shop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside the shop were many boxes and cabinets. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of these boxes I found the Telephone. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large cupboard-like box, and contained a small Electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">device by which one could converse with another at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great distance. Calling in a loud voice was unnecessary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one could plainly hear and speak in a normal tone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I distinctly heard a feminine voice ask me for a number,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but before I could think of one, she selected another</seg><seg type="columnLine">person's offering, to perform her trick, and told me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">retire as she was busy. There was considerable buzzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on in the bell-shaped ear-piece. But this noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">would no doubt be soon eliminated and one would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to converse over a busy wire without disturbance;</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they were quick in selecting a number. Kate informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that the lady's voice I had heard was many miles away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had been carried by Electricity over two small metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires. There was no way of proving this statement at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, but I will say that I looked behind the cup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board and found no one hiding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I came from the Telephone box, Kate showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me another much smaller box. It was the Radio. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard voices. This time there was a man singing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mother in a sad voice. He cried for her like a calf.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a very good imitation, but the music was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor and uneven. Most of the notes were off key and</seg><seg type="columnLine">very flat. However, this was to be expected, Kate said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Radio was a new invention and not fully de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped at that time. Like the telephone, the voice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">music were carried over the same distance, but with Radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no wires strung along the way. Kate said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the noise or music was hurled through the air by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Electricity and caught by the Radio in the shop. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who owned the shop said that the Radio was "in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune" with the sending equipment. Again, I had to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">their word for it, but my personal opinion was that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things were very much out of tune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kate was a master conjurer and took delight in point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out a third box in which the music had been caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stored up for future hearing. I know that my fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Romans are thinking that I am a great liar when I tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such seemingly impossible things as these. I assure</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone that the actual devices were before me and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed just as I have stated. However, I am at a loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell how they worked, and I believe that neither Kate</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor the shop-man could have done much explaining,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had I been able to question them at any length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I, myself, hardly believed in the last mechanical box,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Phonograph, but the shopkeeper convinced me be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond all doubt with a fourth box. He called this last</seg><seg type="columnLine">device a Dictaphone. He requested me to speak a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">words in the attached tube. He then made a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystic motion with his hands and, lo . . . I again heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own voice speak from the box and say the word* I</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ICE MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1031</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had already spoken. Verily, I heard my voice speak the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very same words over and over again. He told me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand years hence my voice would continue repeat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the words from the box, even though I would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">long since dead. Ah, my Romans, this was indeed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very strange land of very strange people who had very</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange boxes. The Dictaphone, which captured my</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, was the greatest thing of all. I could listen to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I would have stayed and better examined this marvel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous Dictaphone, but Kate, in her characteristic New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York rushing manner, led me outside the shop. She said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had not seen anything compared to what she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet to show me. She referred to more New York in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventions, for she was then wearing the typical New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York dress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under her guidance we came upon a large hole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. It was covered with a hood-like canopy and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance to an ingenious subterranean chariot-train</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the Subway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We sped down the brightly illuminated steps of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole until I thought we surely must have reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">realm of Hades. At a very low level we came upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great open place. On either side in deep channels, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw swiftly moving trains made up of many wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">chariots. They were much longer than the Taxi and</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled at terrific speed. I had thought we were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch their operation, but before I knew what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, we were thrust inside of one that had quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped at our feet. In an instant we were whisked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in the darkness. I had become quite fond of Kate</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this time and trusted her implicitly, but nevertheless</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart was riding in my mouth during the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey underground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1FELT a sudden change of atmosphere and Kate told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that we were traveling under the bed of a River.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under the bed of East River we were boring our path!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could hardly believe it! Great ships wrere plowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way on the surface of the river above as we rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the darkness under the water. The roar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train wheels was deafening on the ears, but I liked it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Kate swayed close to my side and gave me reassur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing squeezes on the arm. The inside of the train was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrell lighted and very pleasant, except that most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passengers had been eating garlic and had neglected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to chew their cloves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Leaving the train at a place called Atlantic Station,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we immediately boarded another. This new train ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground for a while and then emerged to the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and thence to a high level built upon Steel stilts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The train was no longer called the Subway. It was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">know'n as the Elevated, while it ran on the stilts. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">much happier to be nearer to Heaven than to Hades. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped that the attendant up front would not forget how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to steer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In about one-half hour we had traveled what would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been a day's journey in Rome. Soon we came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city of Coney Island. Even at that time I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly believe that I had been set free only that morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had traveled many miles unto a new city and had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most marvelous things of my life, and the hour was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only half-after ten by the New York reckoning. As Kate</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked, the evening was young "yet" and "I ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen nothin' yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Coney Island was a gorgeous dream city that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially built for the encouragement of young couples</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in love. It proved to be an ideal place for one to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">intimately acquainted with his fair lady. However</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kate and I hardly required any stimulant to promote</seg><seg type="columnLine">our congeniality. For I had long since marveled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">how quickly we had come to know and understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other's feelings during the short time we had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. Only a few hours past, we had not known of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other's existence, but our close companionship</seg><seg type="columnLine">through those short adventure-seeking hours had bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">us together like friends and lovers of long standing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our unrestrained emotions, bursting forth as we dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered new adventures at every turn, had opened our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts and torn down the usual barricade of poise one</seg><seg type="columnLine">generally affects when in company with one of the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite sex. It was surprising how quickly a stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">could meet and become an intimate friend of a New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady. Nevertheless, I found that our Coney Island</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit added strength to our mutual bond, and we both felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if we had known each other since birth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the hour that we toured the city of Coney</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island, I saw so many marvelous sights and strange de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vices that my head was muddled in a myriad of dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Electric lights amidst hundreds of hot-meat vendors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless squawking advertisers of gambling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thing I will never forget was our many rides on</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath-taking death-defying devices that were known as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coasters. These Coasters were built up on high stilts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oh! much higher than the elevated stilts. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">also built down deep like the Subway. Their paths</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually dropped from high pinnacles to deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravines below. It was as if the builders had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to make up their minds as to what they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to construct, Subway or Elevated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The principle of the Coaster was that each man pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger had to clutch his woman companion tightly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she squealed in fright on the top of each hill. A long</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark tunnel had been conveniently placed on a nice level</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch at the base of the last hill. By the time the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reached the male escort had become well acquainted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his fair lady's outline. It seems needless to report</seg><seg type="columnLine">that when we found ourselves shot into the tunnel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">close embrace, we straightway eliminated any further de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay of our inevitable kiss. In fact we made up for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">time that might have been lost. I want to say right</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, that, even though Kate's words usually were only</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, meaningless ejaculations, I felt that she possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eloquence of expression, such as I had never attained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any of my many-worded speeches in Rome, when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">concluded each kiss with her, "Oh, Daddy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Coaster was a wonderful invention!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Later, Kate gleefully introduced me to another United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States or New* York wronder-box. It was a device that</seg><seg type="columnLine">required only an instant to paint one's likeness. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the Photograph. It was the most wonderful box</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the boxes . . . even more wonderful than the Dic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taphone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Kate and I were led to a seat in a toy airplane, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">an attendant made some little movements over his box-</seg><seg type="columnLine">device. In less time than it takes me to write, he sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied us with six miniature paintings that were most ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">act in detail and likeness. Nowhere have I ever seen such</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous work. Nothing will ever equal the lightning</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed with which we were painted. All my life I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed for a portrait of myself, but never did I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would become rich or famous enough to have my de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sire fulfilled. The six paintings from the wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">Photograph-box I gave to Kate for safe-keeping. Thev</seg><seg type="columnLine">1032</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were, by far, the greatest inventions of all this invention-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blessed land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the return journey to New York we found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Subway to be considerably less crowded and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to ride in seats. I had not noticed that there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats on the first trip. Kate snuggled to my side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed her head to droop on my shoulder. I reasoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had at last become tired and sleepy and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions of our retiring to her abode. But in this I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken, for we had no sooner reached Times Square</seg><seg type="columnLine">Station than she was up on her feet, bubbling over with</seg><seg type="columnLine">new enthusiasm and lust for adventure. What stamina</seg><seg type="columnLine">these New York ladies possessed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We hailed a passing taxi and entered its passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment to settle in the deep luxury of the seats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kate directed the driver to take us out Lenox Avenue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to One-hundred and Thirty-fifth Street. I had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">so acclimated to being ridden swiftly hither and yon</seg><seg type="columnLine">in New York, that the taxi's high speed no longer thrilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. However, I found a new and better thrill could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in a taxi. It was a marvelous place in which one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could promote unrestricted love-making with one's fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady while flying through the main streets of New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York. The Coaster had taught us to make the most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">every opportunity. Likewise, most of New York's</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens must have been in the same mood, for I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that every taxi we passed contained occupants similarly</seg><seg type="columnLine">entwined. I gleefully thought of how it would appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Rome if all men tried to caress their maidens while</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding along the Forum in chariots. However, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprising how quickly one could travel while engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this artful occupation. Just when things were be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming interesting, we were interrupted by arriving at</seg><seg type="columnLine">our destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After we alighted, Kate told me that she was taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to a place called a Night Club. It seemed that any</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger's evening in New York was not complete with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a concluding Night Club visit. I was willing to fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low Kate unto the last, last adventure, wherever she</seg><seg type="columnLine">chose to lead, for the promise in her eyes was such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one sees when the trail is near the end. My only fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that the Professor's fast diminishing purse would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stand the strain much longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Night Club proved to be a very large Restaurant</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which many citizens and their ladies were having</seg><seg type="columnLine">little feasts at secluded, independent tables. A squad</seg><seg type="columnLine">of African musicians furnished weird barbaric notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">from odd-shaped trumpets and a large drum. The noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat upon the ears with stimulating rhythm and seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have a hilarious effect upon everyone present. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">chorus of sparsely dressed Ethiopian females were ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecuting fantastic dance steps and body wiggles in a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">open place between the tables. The free spirit of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geniality, together with the intoxicating music, steeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone to a high pitch. This tempo was undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to assist one in downing the liquid these New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yorkers had to drink. The drink was called hootch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had to be diluted with a portion of mineral water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lemon juice before one dared place it in one's mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was always drunk in a single quaff or gulped down as</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily as possible, lest one's grimaces became perma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent. I think the stuff was made from this unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing they called Electricity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I longed to show these New Yorkers our Roman art</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sipping drinks; but after drinking my first glass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hootch I, too, realized that their method of gulping was</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS the evening sped along into the last hours of night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt as if a veil had been lifted from my eyes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights seemed to have brightened in color, the dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures seemed to have more animation and less raiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their bodies as they floated across the floor. Everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be toned into a beautiful, harmonious blend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Kate's ravishing beauty seemed more vivid than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she openly kissed me across the table. I realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had had many drinks of hooch, and although I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in any sense drunk, I certainly was pleased with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlook on life in this wonderful New York and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States. However, I decided to control my thirst</seg><seg type="columnLine">lest I became totally intoxicated and would be unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">survive the climax of a most wonderful evening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh, what a climax it was. When it finally came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">us it was nothing like what I had expected. The bright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the evening was immediately snuffed out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tragedy crossed the dance floor in the form of a power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully built Ethiopian who made some slurring remark</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Kate. This was the beginning of the end!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quick as a flash I was upon the slave. He must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">underestimated my condition, for he was unprepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my onslaught and I quickly and easily lifted him over</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head and hurled him through the air. He crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with terrific force upon the startled musicians and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered them and their rigging to the four winds. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">action brought forth screams of terror from all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladies, and chaos reigned throughout the hall. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time on, I was busily engaged in battle. In a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of time I had piled up an amazing heap of humanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the musician's platform. Verily, I would have con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quered all of my enemies, had they not brought into play</seg><seg type="columnLine">another insidious New York invention, called the Gat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Pistol. Before this new weapon, I went down in de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These pistols, or gats, were diabolical things of steel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were short, compact little devices that spat forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame and fire and sent lead pellets hurtling through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. Without these weapons, one was helpless. I sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor writhing in agony. Three or four pistols</seg><seg type="columnLine">had used my body as a target. I had a vague recollection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some New York ushers or Cops appearing upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene, but at that point I fell into a swoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon awakening, I found myself again a prisoner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a while I was in a hospital but I was later trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to a cell in the New York jail. At first my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds were very painful and I feared that I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">die before I could again see Kate. However, my strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-kept body soon healed and I was ready to depart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the Cops insisted that I remain in my cell and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">I languished for three months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While awaiting my release, I had the opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to observe and study two more marvels of this land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were paper and printing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The paper was similar to our Liber. Like our Pugil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lares, it was made of wood and was in common use. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was very different from these Pugillares, which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only wax-coated slabs of wood. The paper was the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult of boiling wood until it became a pulp and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing this mass into thin sheets. It was as enduring</seg><seg type="columnLine">as our Papyrus from Egypt and after it had dried out</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly, one could fold or bend the stuff without hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it crack or become brittle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> None of the paper came in rolls, but instead was bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">in little small leafed booklets. On the paper was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other invention called printing. It was a quick way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make many copies of the same writing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ICE MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1033</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This printing was accomplished by using large em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bossed plates similar to our coins. These plates were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coated with an ink-fluid and lightly touched on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper with a machine. The resulting impression was</seg><seg type="columnLine">printing. Long speeches and even paintings were pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced in this manner. During my stay in the jail I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample opportunity to read many books and news bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">letins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My association with my fellow prisoners has given</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a thought that I believe will be helpful to you Romans</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you demand my immediate release. From listen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the conversation of the men about me I learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the names of some of the prominent men in this country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowing that a messenger will be dispatched with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste as soon as this report reaches Rome, I am giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the names of the men most spoken of, so that it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to whom the order of release should be addressed:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gene Tunney, Cal, Hornsby, Babe, A1 Smith, Lindy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoover, Jack Dempsey, and Will Rogers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After three months in jail I was given a trial. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trial as it was. It was just a foolish pretense of jus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tice, the sole object being to have all concerned establish</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves as public speakers of great renown. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not allowed to even make a speech. One blustering citi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zen made some highly insulting remarks about my men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tality. I took immediate offense and grappled him about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throat, but the Cops sprang to his rescue and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to listen in silence. Upon his word alone, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent back to my cell. He called me the "Ice Man" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said many other things which I will not repeat, lest Rome</seg><seg type="columnLine">declare war with this country. I was merely the ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a game. I was tossed back and forth from cell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">court while the lawyers, and some citizens called Alien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ists, were enabled to show their skill at the pastime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout the trial I made vain efforts to establish</seg><seg type="columnLine">my identity but was repulsed at every turn. Finally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was judged insane and committed to an asylum. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am now in this asylum called B- While here im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoned I have written this report, in the hope that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will in some way reach you Romans and that my release</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be speedily effected. I advise you to send a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">army with the messenger, for these New Yorkers are</seg><seg type="columnLine">very obstinate in their views and say that you Romans</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a "dead" race of people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I will bide my time and await the coming of a likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking visitor to whom I must intrust the delivery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this report.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Signed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MARCUS PUBLIUS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">P.S.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We know nothing more than you do," the cultured</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of the old projessor assured me.

I asked.

Outside of being slightly dizzy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I laid to the lack of gravity, I managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the white-haired figure of Kepling without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">mishaps, although my eyes were busily roving over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic building which Jim later told that he had nick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">named "The Temple of the Stars." It was formed of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">type of composition that at first glance resembled glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but although it was transparent, yet it glowed with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver luminosity, giving the effect of diffused moonlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as Kepling reached the edge of this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace, and pointed back to a bright yellow star below us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luminosity of the floor and walls, which I will con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue to call glass for the want of a better name, faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and the stars glowed through the black abysses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space at us from all sides like millions of vari-colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights. How aptly Jim had named the ship! I was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">awe-struck at the gorgeous spectacle which they pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented, that I failed to note the puzzled frown that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept over the placid features of the white-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something is the matter with the sun--I mean our</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun," he announced, his usually quiet voice vibrating with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a note of alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I expected as much," I heard myself saying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I mean it's a hunch that came to me yesterday,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or day before, or last week--or whenever it wras that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you gave your lecture on Nova Persei."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then why didn't you mention it in the office ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forgot it, I suppose.

He had suggested . . . oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain disagreeable possibilities."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Kepling was no longer listening to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" he cried, his voice trembling with excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My eyes turned unwillingly--almost fearfully back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that little yellow star. It was ablaze. Its dazzling glory</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to expand--eclipsing the more feeble lights of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest neighbors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then again I felt that strange presence near me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning around, I saw' the flower-like being floating near</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in all its ghostly, silver beauty. One long, radiant</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacle slowly separated itself from the others and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to a great opaque globe which began to glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a ruby light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, a new type of telescope, I suppose," I said as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kepling's horror-stricken eyes followed my pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly the ruby light began to shrink, turning to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glaring white as it concentrated in a spot of terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is showing us the sun--our sun . . The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomer's voice ended in a groan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly I saw it--that wave of fire--spread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ... on every side . . . spreading. Jim covered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes as if to shut out the horror of it. Beside me</seg><seg type="columnLine">1040</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the flower-thing floated silently, his phosphorescence</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching the scene with a detached, unearthly shimmer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps he lingered there with unexpressed and inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressible sympathy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wave of flame spread on and succeeding waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed it, until the glare of the flaming disc became</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbearable. But the globe followed the first wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, and slowly the gleaming nucleus drifted to the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim uncovered his eyes again and stared as a hypno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tized man might stare at the globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flashing in a trillion sparkles, the wave of white-hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas was reaching for its first planet . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mercury!" Kepling gasped, even as the wave engulfed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and turned it into a tiny torch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light of the conflagration seemed to intensify</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it spread, and again the globe followed its expanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge. I felt my throat tighten as Venus swept into view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But almost immediately it was caught up in the veil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, seemed to actually explode in hissing steam and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly swung toward the edge of the globe as the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet accompanied by its tiny silver bubble of a moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into the path of the fiery death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kepling groaned, while Jim stared like one turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. In that moment of horror, as we watched in help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less misery the luminescent wave creeping upon our little</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, I seemed to be able to see with my mind's eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets of the cities with their floods of terror-stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces turned skyward--some groping with blind stares</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which sight had been forever blasted, and others</seg><seg type="columnLine">glaring with pupils from which the light of reason had</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the wave of death swept on--engulfing the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and causing it to gleam suddenly like a large diamond</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown into a strong light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kepling slumped limply to the floor. That movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled Jim from his frozen state, and he bent over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old gentleman with white, drawn features. But I stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered back away from the globe, closing my hands over</seg><seg type="columnLine">my face as if to shut out its terrible message. My foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck a bench and on this I sank, dropping my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Infinite moments went by. Finally I felt a hand on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulder and heard Kepling's voice murmuring:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know, my boy, that it is easier to face the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible death oneself, than to realize that everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">one has loved and lived for has been swept away in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of unspeakable terror, but the past is past while</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are still alive and must go on/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As wanderers of space."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, as wanderers of space," he nodded, gripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulder harder with his slender fingers. "For with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the need of words it has been revealed to us why</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were kidnaped."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps he too ... he seemed sort of helplessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathetic when it happened," I murmured, noting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the globe had turned black and that the silver luminosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come back into the floor and the walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps," the wThite head nodded. "It is a cruel, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">believable fact to face but we must realize that not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">our friends, but also all art, all history and literature, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sciences--everything which we call our civilization</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been swept like a gnat into nothingness. For when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we three die, our race will be no more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't!" Jim begged in a whisper, instinctively using</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hushed tones that one falls into in the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO it was that our great adventnre was begun upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ashes of tragedy, and this was why the bitterness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that tragedy never entirely forsook our minds. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">though in the days which followed, we did much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">regain our zest for life, yet behind it always loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that terrible knowledge that the past was blotted out--</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the future but a hopeless blank, even as those</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark apertures torn in the star-clouds of the heavens</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a blank, through which we seem to look into endless</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothingness . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now time slipped by, almost without the realiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that it was passing. Kepling worked almost un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceasingly upon copying what he could remember of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific books, while Jim and I spent hours at the glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall looking out at the stars which gleamed around us</seg><seg type="columnLine">like endless swarms of fireflies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We saw our host but seldom, although he seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipate our wishes in a most extraordinary manner, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects we had desired always appearing to materialize</seg><seg type="columnLine">from nowhere. He himself, however, kept out of sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">--either preferring to stay invisible or else remaining in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper part of the palace-ship which we had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. We often commented upon him, wandering where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had come from, where he was going and again, if he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, was the victim of one of those catastrophes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomers had called novae--an exile without a parent</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization--a wanderer through space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This feeling was intensified, when passing near to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Algol, he distracted our attention from the "'Demon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sun" by pointing one gleaming tentacle to the nebulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotating ring of Nova Persei, which was looming up</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a strange Saturn among the stars, and then slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fading away again into darkness. Jim was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">to voice his opinion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were right, Doc. This man from space is cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly interested in Nova Persei."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kepling nodded thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wanted: one Sherlock Holmes." I grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I don't know why it should, but it gives me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creeps to think that he might have come from Nova</seg><seg type="columnLine">Persei," Jim murmured with a shrug.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the way he has of fading away into nothingness</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives me the creeps," I added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is equally possible that our methods of locomotion</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him the creeps," Kepling smiled. "Personally, I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the opinion that his method has innumerable advan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tages."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Especially in some of the exploring expeditions that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we probably have in store for us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" Kepling interrupted. "The nebula around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nova Persei is pretty plain now because of our near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness--but the condensations--they are easily distin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guished."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know, Doc," Jim said thoughtfully, "they do</seg><seg type="columnLine">look like the remains of planets. Not that I'm upholding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the theory that they were run down by a dark star, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely overtaken by the wave of fire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kepling's eyes sparkled suddenly as the idea took hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Possibly they are. I wish I could turn the globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to our sun and observe what has happened," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said earnestly, the scientist of him fully aroused over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conception of a new theory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had no sooner uttered the wish than the globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouded with showers of stars and comets, until at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immeasurably further distance than we had viewed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN FROM SPACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1041</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">before, a flaming sun flashed upon the screen. Surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it was a very faint nebulous haze and dimly marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">were four tiny condensations--somewhat brighter than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luminescent veil which surrounded them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why only four?" I asked in surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are evidently too far away to see the four minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets and those are the major four."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good reasoning, Jim," Kepling smiled affectionately.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But it does have an uncanny resemblance to Nova</seg><seg type="columnLine">Persei," I put in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Except that the positions are about reversed," Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, there is no need of forming theories any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, but the habits of a life-time are hard to break."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The white-haired figure smiled wistfully as I turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the globe. Somehow, the sight of that gloriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful funeral pyre hurt me more than the lash of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whip. Disconsolately I turned away, walking toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite wall and looking off through the myriad swarms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stars that glowed in through the darkened sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. Then suddenly I stopped and stared. For out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tail of my eye I had caught sight of an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored light ahead of us that loomed up like a vast comet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked up quickly. The new object, which seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have appeared from behind the hidden prow of our space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship as if we had been steering toward it and now were</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerving to one side, was a brilliant blue sun, the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">third of which was covered by its reddish-yellow com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion. I had often viewed binary or double stars back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the old University telescope, so the sight was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual, but the nearness of this pair made me gasp at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the splendor of the spectacle they presented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come quickly!" I called out with excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim was the first one to reach my side, but the white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired astronomer was not far behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look at the blue sun up there with its companion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks like a huge luminous orange."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must be Almack," Kepling said thoughtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Almack?" I asked, trying to place the familiar name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes. You will remember that in my lecture on</seg><seg type="columnLine">multiple suns, I mentioned this group of three."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three ?" I said quizzically, taking another look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent double.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, three. Behind the orange sun, you will see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin green outline of the third. Like all multiple suns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will remember that they revolve around their com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon center of gravity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you say the third sun was green ?" I asked, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to separate it from the red corona of the orange.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you remember our discussion on that very</seg><seg type="columnLine">group?" Jim grinned at me. "You were trying to figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the sunset effects."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sounds more like your ideas. You were the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary bug of our group."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps so. But oh how I would like to take a peek</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a world lit by this trio of colored suns!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is a wish that I have secretly nursed all of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life," Kepling admitted softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HARDLY had the words left his lips, than the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewel-like suns swung back toward the prow, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming eclipsed at last by the forepart of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is going to take us there," I laughed. "How's</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for thought reading?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, the wish was double," Kepling smiled, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore doubly strong."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Triple," I corrected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim laughed as the silver luminosity came back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls.

For a long time, however, sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not come to me.

As the great globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed up toward us, lit by its sinking green and rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange sun, we kneeled down and finally threw ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">prone upon the floor as the mountain chains took more</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite form. Kepling was the first to point out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast moon-like craters that dotted the face of the planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lifted jagged crags skyward from the level of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be a dead plain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Evidently very little water," the astronomer com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented tersely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The seas do appear to be dried up--very much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the state on the moon," Jim agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The green sun had dropped from sight when at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">we decided that the light patches on the mountain tops</seg><seg type="columnLine">were snow. It was an orange world that we now rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered ourselves upon, hovering sometimes and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming to waver along sideways as if seeking a par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular spot which the engineer had admired during a</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous visit. Jim was the first one to suggest this pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility, and once the idea was planted, it grew upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We finally passed a part of the wildly mountainous</seg><seg type="columnLine">country which began to be lit by the blue sun on one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the orange on the other. At this point the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to waver and began to drop rapidly toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains, landing with a scarcely perceptible jar on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">level plateau that was just opposite a tremendous talon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like range of peaks. The little plateau upon which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found ourselves seemed to be itself the peak of a moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain, though not as high as the chain opposite--nor could</seg><seg type="columnLine">we look down the other side, for another glance showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">us that our resting place was not quite the top, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small ridge had to be climbed first. For a moment now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we rested in shadow, but it was a weird twilight, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenish tint lingering in the heavens only as a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterglow, giving the effect of strangeness which I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes noted on earth, after a wild storm has mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentarily torn a cleft in the clouds for the zodiacal light</seg><seg type="columnLine">to peer through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then as we stood there by the glass walls, our spectre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like host floated down toward us from the shimmering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upper drapes, and pointing with one of his lustrous ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacles, he called our attention to an open doorway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which a cool breeze sprang into the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JIM was the first one through, landing in the moss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like growth of the plateau with one long jump. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed. Bounding along like a puppy that has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">held in confinement, he ran with long leaps and jumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the edge of the cliff where he stopped and waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a maniac. I caught up with him with such a leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I almost went over the cliff, while the white-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of the scientist followed with more dignity. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I looked down into the valley, the unearthly char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter of this moon-scape left me gasping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Imagine, if you can, a range of huge silt mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which ever-tumbling veils of snow and rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped intermittently into a gorge four times deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the Grand Canyon, with a dull roar. It seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stood there that I was gazing upon a staircase for</seg><seg type="columnLine">giants leading down to a bottomless pit of half-fluid</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud, and then over it all that weirdly-changing sky and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally the first gleams of the blue sun, as it climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a knife-slashed pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was still looking in awe-struck silence when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kepling's voice murmured:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe that the scene on the other side just over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ridge, is perhaps equally interesting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can it be?" Jim gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Such is the judgment of our host at any rate. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed up that way but you two rushed off too vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously to even notice his instructions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we can go up there; but Doc, just look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that pit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The region is evidently still volcanic," Kepling mused,</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking up a rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some push certainly heaved up those mountains. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at that swamp," Jim persisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kepling nodded thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I bet it's full of funny-looking monsters," I laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not-so funny close up," Jim interrupted. "But let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">take that look at the other side. Personally, I feel like</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting some exercise. The only trouble with space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel is that there are so few stop-overs and those are</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far apart!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So with Jim leading the way, we climbed up the rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading toward the ridge. Once over the top, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our leader did a war dance to convince us of his approval</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the view, while I turned and smiled at Kepling. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">old scientist waved away my offer of assistance, and I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, leaped over the intervening rocks, where I stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slumped down with awe-struck eyes. For yawning</seg><seg type="columnLine">below us wras the cavernous depths of a vast crater</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a molten lake boiled and bubbled--the living lava</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashing up with livid spurts of hellish splendor in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing pit--miles below us. Across from us the oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site walls of the crater were outlined blackly against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">carmine sky, the sinking rays of the setting orange sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving the appearance of a huge conflagration raging</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the unseen slopes of the other side, which, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept through the crater, had left this lake of glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">embers behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Overhead the sky was turning a reddish-purple, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to one side a huge purplish moon, half ruby and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half blue, was rising.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kepling stopped for a moment on top and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped over to the very edge and looked down. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just admiring the old scientist's nice sense of balance</seg><seg type="columnLine">1044</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">when I heard him give a sharp cry, saw him throw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body around as if to catch himself, and then go plunging</seg><seg type="columnLine">down through the darkness toward that glowing pit. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to my feet in horror when a sudden convulsion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rocks made me look down. Imagine my terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">to realize that what we had mistaken for a ridge of rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our delight at the scene before us was a sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragon--a huge armored creature which had been taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nap on the crater's rim. Kepling had been standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the thing's back, and therefore had been the first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall as it moved. So perfectly matched to the rocks had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been his protective coloring that we had not noticed him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I leapt to his tail, intending to then jump to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">lava projections and try to get a glimpse of the old pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor, before the monster turned on me, but I was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow. He swished his tail, hurling me unceremoniously</seg><seg type="columnLine">into space whence I dashed helplessly against some rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started to slide down the cliffs toward that red, bub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling horror. Miraculously, I don't know how, I kept my</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses, digging my heels and fingers into the earth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop me and clutching what plants I could grasp. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last I caught a gnarled plant growing at the very edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the long drop into the cauldron. There I swung be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the lava cliff and the burning lake, with only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">toe-hold with which to climb back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When at last, shivering and perspiring, I finally pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself up and lay limply on the black rock, a wail and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a roar sent my eyes back to the monster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something was being pulverized into nothingness</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the maddened stamps of the great beast whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming red eyes did not note that a new menace flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air at him, until it wTas too late, and a silvery-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming, flower-like creature with shimmering tentacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit upon his back like a giant insect of some terrible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">malignant type. With a roar of agony that reverberated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from cliff to cliff through that glowing crater, the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal leaped into the air and headed straight for me--</seg><seg type="columnLine">maddened into frenzy by the stinging thing which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not shake off.

"She may not be in on it, but that is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason why he shouldn't bump his partner off so as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get a chance to grab both the swag and the skirt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think that you are jumping at conclusions too</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily, Sergeant," said the cashier. "Mr. Hunter has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been with us for a number of years and he is held in</seg><seg type="columnLine">high esteem by the officers. I am sure that Mr. Fleck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, the president, will never consent to his being</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrested in any such summary fashion on so little</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't guess that he'll get much chance to consent,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied the sergeant with a grin. "Jenkins, put those</seg><seg type="columnLine">bracelets on him and take him away. Three of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">men go along; he might have some pals that would try a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescue stunt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hunter started to protest but the cashier silenced him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better go with them quietly, Glenn," he advised.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They have the right to take you and we can't stop them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as Mr. Fleckner gets here I'll tell him the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing and he'll have you out in a few minutes. I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">very well that the whole accusation is silly, but there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no use arguing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DESPITE the cashier's representations, the presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent refused to take hasty action and Hunter was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still in jail when a group met in the president's office to</seg><seg type="columnLine">consult about the situation. Mr. Fleckner, a gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired man with a stubborn jaw and a steely glitter in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes that bodes little good to transgressors, sat at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the table. Seated around the table were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief of Detectives from the City Hall, the sergeant</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had arrested Hunter, the District Attorney, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO ROBBERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1049</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cashier and a quietly dressed little man who so far had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said little and listened much. His inconspicuousness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress and manner would have enabled him to pass un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed in a crowd, yet it was evident that when he spoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the president listened with respect and close attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''Sergeant/' said the quiet man suddenly, "please tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">your story again and tell it carefully. Be especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful in describing Mr. Hunter's words and actions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Try to lay aside your vanity and prejudice for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that we can get an idea of what really happened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The sergeant turned red and looked to his chief as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">for protection. The Chief of Detectives looked sour and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the speaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Before this bullying goes any farther, Mr. Carnes,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "I want to know one thing. Are you in charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this case, and if so, by what authority?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I am in charge of one phase of it," replied the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">man quietly. "As far as your suspected murder goes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is a State matter and I have nothing to say about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As far as the robbery of the Federal Reserve Bank of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philadelphia goes, I am in charge by the authority of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States of America. Mr. Fleckner told you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was sent here from the Treasury Department in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington: it may interest you to know that I am Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Federal Secret Service for this district. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">are my credentials if you care to examine them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chief of Detectives glanced at the credentials</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered to him, and then turned to the sergeant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Go ahead and tell your story, Halloran," he grunted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell it straight too. This man is the real goods."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sergeant Halloran retold his story, dwelling at length</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Hunter's supposed confession about the bomb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will do," said Carnes suddenly. He sat for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment in thought and then turned to the Chief of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Detectives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has your Office done about tracing the gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipment?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chief consulted a memorandum which he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The shipment looks all right," he admitted. "It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipped from the Golconda mine, exactly the same as</seg><seg type="columnLine">other shipments have been. The Golconda production</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold has been normal. They have been shipping at</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the same rate for several years and they have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">surplus of gold on hand. The stuff was assayed while</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was held in the express company's office at the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shipment, and it was never out of sight of an armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">messenger from the time it left until it reached here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The express agent is ready to swear that he delivered</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold here and that both Mr. Hunter and Mr. Barnett</seg><seg type="columnLine">verified the weights in his presence. There were three</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards used to bring it in and they are all old men</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. They all agree that it was gold. They know the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference between gold and copper too, for we tested</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did anyone leave the building after Hunter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barnett last night?" asked Carnes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No one," replied the president. "I have the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete records of the door guard here. After the express</seg><seg type="columnLine">people left, there was an eleven-minute interval before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Barnett left. Thirty-seven minutes later Mr. Hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter left. H^e was the last one out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Has that vault been disturbed?" asked Carnes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No, it has not," replied the president. "As soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Hunter was taken away, Mr. Moulton had the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">propped in place and posted guards to see that no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered. When I got here I confirmed his orders and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had the vault left undisturbed for your examination."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's look at it," remarked Carnes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the vault, he took merely a cursory glance around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the pile of copper bars negligently and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Sergeant Halloran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your theory is that Mr. Hunter arranged a bomb</seg><seg type="columnLine">that exploded shortly after the vault was opened in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, isn't it?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," replied Halloran eagerly. "As far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Answer my questions please and don't volunteer</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinions," snapped Carnes. "You have done enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage already. When you entered the vault did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell any peculiar odor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I didn't," replied Halloran shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you, Mr. Moulton?" asked Carnes turning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cashier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I noticed no odor at all," replied the cashier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How soon after the explosion did you get here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Within a minute or two."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought so," remarked Carnes meditatively. "Ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geant Halloran, did you ever arrive at a place where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bomb had gone off within half an hour after it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, several times."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And when you did, did you ever notice an acrid odor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of burned powder?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, every time," admitted Halloran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you noticed nothing of the sort here? Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let your imagination run away with you. Did you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, sir, I did not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neither did Mr. Moulton and yet he arrived at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time when the air should have been thick with smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the odor of burned explosive very noticeable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strange, isn't it ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has that to do with it?" interrupted the Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Detectives. "It is quite probable that they didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice it in the excitement."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Possible, but not probable," replied Carnes. "Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ever examine the scene of a bomb explosion?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dozens of times," replied the chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The local damage done at the point where the bomb</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay was always quite extensive, wasn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, yes," replied Carnes with a far-away look in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. "Also fragments of the container can usually be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found embedded in the walls. I don't seem to observe</seg><seg type="columnLine">any here. Perhaps you will point out to me just where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bomb lay that exploded this morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The detective was silenced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I fancy that we are through with Sergeant Halloran</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the present," remarked Carnes. "If the rest of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen will join me in Mr. Fleckner's office, we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">discuss the matter further."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you of the opinion that there was no bomb, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carnes?" asked the District Attorney when the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference reassembled, minus Sergeant Halloran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It wras not a bomb," replied Carnes positively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What in Heaven's name caused the explosion then?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the president.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," said Carnes thoughtfully. "In fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are several puzzling features about the case. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that it was not a bomb or any usual explosive that</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the damage. It acted like a gas explosion, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are no gas mains in the building and to introduce enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas to cause an explosion of that magnitude into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vault by any means other than a pipe would require</seg><seg type="columnLine">1050</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">several heavy bulky cylinders that could not be hidden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no such things have entered or left the building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Further, I can see no object in causing an explosion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sergeant Halloran's theory is-" said the Chief</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of Detectives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can eliminate that," interrupted Carnes. "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that gold was delivered here last night. A ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of copper might have fooled one man, but unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">two express messengers and three bank guards were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it as well as Hunter, Barnett and the express agent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wouldn't be possible. I believe that the gold was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">livered and stolen from the vault last night after Hunter</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. I am inclined to think that Hunter knows no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it than we do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All the same we'll hold him for a while," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the District Attorney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suit yourself," said Carnes with a shrug. "If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were you, Fd turn him loose and if I suspected him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd have him shadowed. However, that's your business</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I don't want to butt in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The District Attorney smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Chief/' Carnes went on, addressing him, "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Secret Service can cover the matter of that shipment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the express messengers more thoroughly than your</seg><seg type="columnLine">men can. If you really want to cooperate, put your</seg><seg type="columnLine">best men on the task of running down the past history</seg><seg type="columnLine">of every guard wTho was on duty here last night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be glad to," replied the Chief of Detectives as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the District Attorney rose to leave. "The entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">resources of my Office are at your service."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you," replied Carnes as he bowed slightly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Moulton," he went on as the remaining three</seg><seg type="columnLine">reseated themselves, "Sergeant Halloran indicated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course of his remarks that both Hunter and Barnett</seg><seg type="columnLine">were interested in your daughter. How much of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be true and how much may be his imagination, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know better than I. However, just as a matter of form,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would like to have a talk with her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As far as her knowing anything about the robbery is</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned, of course there is no truth in it," replied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cashier shortly. "As far as the interest of the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her goes, she can tell you how far it had gone better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I can. If you care to interview her, I will call hen"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is no need for that," said Carnes. "I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be glad to go to your home and talk to her there."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She is in the building," replied the cashier. "She has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been here for some time waiting for a chance to inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cede for Glenn Hunter. I can call her in a moment."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carnes nodded assent and the cashier went out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning in a few minutes with a strikingly handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. She was about nineteen, of a slim and graceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">build that just escaped being too slender. Her firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">modeled chin gave the lie to her dreamy eyes, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carnes, as he glanced at her, shrewdly surmised that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent tears which it was evident that she had shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">might account for some of the mistiness that marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He sprang to his feet as she entered and bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply in acknowledgment of her father's introduction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down, Miss Moulton, please," he' exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding a chair for her. His voice sounded all polite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and concern, and Fleckner smiled to himself as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw that Carnes had placed her chair so that she sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing the light, while his own face was in shadow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE seated herself as he requested and with folded</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands awaited his questions. Carnes seemed at a loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to how to begin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Moulton," he said hesitatingly, "it seems that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of your friends, Mr. HJunter, has been arrested by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the local police as a suspect in connection with the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mr. Barnett. Some of the city detectives seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that jealousy may have been a contributing factor</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the affair. In order to clear up the situation, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">you mind telling me what you know about both of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">men?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Glenn had no reason for jealousy and he knew it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied Alice Moulton in a calm monotone that hinted at</seg><seg type="columnLine">inward agitation. "Both he and Charley Barnett have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been quite regular visitors at my father's house for</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly a year, and about two months ago both of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed to me. I refused to give an answer to either</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them at the time and told them that I would decide</seg><seg type="columnLine">later. Last night I accepted Glenn and, while he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, I telephoned Charley and told him my decision.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He apparently took it quite calmly, and when he learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Glenn was there, he asked to talk to him and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratulated him very nicely. Despite their rivalry, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have always been the best of friends. So you can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the idea of jealousy is absurd."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Hunter was at your house last night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, he was. He came in after supper, about eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should say, and stayed until after eleven."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What were you doing?" asked Carnes. "I beg your</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardon," he went on hastily. "You need not answer that</seg><seg type="columnLine">question. It is quite evident what a newly engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple would do under the circumstances."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ghost of a smile hovered for an instant on Alice</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moulton's lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We weren't doing what you might suspect," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I have no objections to answering. In point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, we were trying to play the radio."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trying to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, but we couldn't get anything. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar buzzing noise that drowned out every station,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and neither Glenn nor I could tune it out. It started</seg><seg type="columnLine">about seven-thirty, before he came in, and it wras still</seg><seg type="columnLine">going when he left. Of course, we weren't working</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the radio all the time, but we turned it on at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen times and tried to get something, but we never</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know anything about Mr. Hunter's circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances?" asked Carnes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naturally, I do," she replied. "He inherited quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little money from his father and he has added to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">by wise investments. At the present time he has an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come aside from his salary of nearly four thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars a year."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course you believe him innocent of this whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">business?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," she said hotly. "The idea of his guilt</seg><seg type="columnLine">is ridiculous. Why on earth should he do a thing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that? He had no cause for jealousy of Charley as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have told you. As far as robbery goos, he has a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">income as it is, and he knows very wrell that I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never consent to share any stolen money with him. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that he's innocent and I came down here to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daddy and Mr. Fleckner and see if they couldn't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out of jail. Won't you help me? Surely you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe him guilty?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I don't," replied Carnes. "I'd release him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once if it were in my power, but unfortunately it isn't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't cry, my dear," he went on hastily as Alice Moul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's lips began to quiver, "just keep a stiff upper lip and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think that we'll have him out of jail soon."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO ROBBERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1051</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you really think so?" she exclaimed gratefully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, Mr. Carnes, Til love you forever if you do."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's plenty of inducement to make me do my best,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he answered gallantly. "Now the best thing that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can do is to go home with your father and lie down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to get a little rest. You can't do any good here. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moulton, you take her home. I'll place her under arrest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and appoint you a deputy to take charge of her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce her when called for. If Sergeant Halloran or</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of his cohorts try to get to her, tell them that she is</seg><seg type="columnLine">under federal arrest and that you can't let them talk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her without my permission. It'll be a cold day in</seg><seg type="columnLine">August when they get it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Alice and her father had gone, Carnes turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the president.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Fleckner," he remarked* "this case has me puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled. For all my shortness to Halloran, I thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly there might be something to his theory, but Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moulton's statement seems to upset it thoroughly by</seg><seg type="columnLine">removing the motive. Of course, I'll check up on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">statements, but they are undoubtedly true. Frankly, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't explain a good many things we need to know. First</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is the matter of that gold shipment. Either there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a widespread conspiracy with a lot of people in it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which case it will be easy to trace it down, or else gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">was delivered here last night. In that case, what became</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it? Also why did the person or persons who removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it go to the trouble to replace it with bars of copper that</seg><seg type="columnLine">are identical in appearance with the purloined gold ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Second there is the explosion. It might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed to get Hunter as well as to get Barnett unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunter planted it, a thing I am not yet ready to admit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also what kind of an explosive was it? It had ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently no center of brisance and it left no fumes or</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor and no fragments of container. Also how did it</seg><seg type="columnLine">get in? These questions all have to be answered before</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are in a position to even start a search for the thieves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With your permission, I'll look at that vault again."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time Carnes did not content himself with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursory glance around that he had given the vault on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first visit, but went over it inch by inch in search of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clues, even examining the floor and walls with a magni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fying glass and sounding every square inch of walls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor and ceiling. At the end of three hours he returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the president's office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did you find, Mr. Carnes ?" asked Fleckner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing," he replied. "I have been over every inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that vault, searching for a means of egress for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold or ingress for the explosive and I have found ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely nothing. I know as much as I did when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">started in and no more. * The case is beyond my depth."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What are you planning to do ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Call for help," replied Carnes with a wry smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are some aspects of the case that point to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of more specialized knowledge than I possess. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am going to call up Washington and ask that Dr. Bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Bureau of Standards be sent down here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of the ablest research men in the Bureau," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied Carnes, "and one who doesn't confine his research</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the regular routine. For instance, he knows more</seg><seg type="columnLine">about blood stains and dust explosions, to mention only</seg><seg type="columnLine">two specialties of his, than any other man in America.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He has helped us out several times on counterfeiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases. When he comes, I want him introduced as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">representative of the Washington Post. No one but you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I are to know his real identity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How soon will he get here ?" asked the president.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I can get in touch with my chief, he will make</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangements for him to get a plane at Bolling Field and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he will be here inside of three hours. Can we get into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank tonight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Telephone me as soon as he arrives and I'll meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">you at the bank."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine," replied Carnes. "Now may I use your Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington wire?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THREE hours later a plane roared to a landing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Philadelphia Navy Yard and Carnes greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passenger. Dr. Bird was grossly misnamed. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing of the bird in his appearance, if one except</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ostrich. He stood well over six feet in height and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was broad and burly in proportion. His prognathous</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw and unruly* shock of curly hair gave him the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a prizefighter, and it was not until an observer noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands that the scientist stood revealed. Long slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate hands they were; the hands of a musician or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleight-of-hand performer, with long tapering sensitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers stained in splotches by acid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Carnes," he roared in a bull-like voice, "what</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you got on tap this time? Another counterfeiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">case?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not this time, Doctor," replied Carnes as he hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to grip the outstretched hand. "This time it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbery, with possible murder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good," ejaculated the Doctor, "murders are always</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting. Glad I brought my traveling laboratory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't see where I would come in on a robbery though."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is a rather unusual robbery," replied Carnes as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he picked up two of the four bags that the pilot had un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded from the plane. "I think that you'll find it in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All of your cases are unusual, even the most com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monplace ones when you get stuck," snorted the Doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you chaps would just manage to learn a little ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary chemistry you would save me a lot of wild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat trips of this nature."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Every man to his trade, Doctor," answered Carnes</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerfully. "You would be broken-hearted if we didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">call on you occasionally. Come along, I've got a taxi</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting, and we'll stop and feed you five cups of black</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee before we go to the bank."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, if it's good coffee," replied the Doctor as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he picked up the remaining bags and followed Carnes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they -arrived at the bank, Fleckner met them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was anxious to give all the details, but the Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped him impatiently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't want to hear a thing about it, just now," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced. "Carnes tells me that there are certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific aspects involved and I want to approach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem with my mind unencumbered with details of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you have done and theories you have propounded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll ask questions as I need to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they entered the vault the Doctor stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffed like a fox-terrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Explosion, eh ?" he remarked to Carnes. "Where was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stuff planted?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's one thing for you to tell me, Doctor," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carnes. "I have been over every inch of the vault and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are no signs of a local center of brisance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No signs of a container either, I suppose?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carnes replied in the negative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hum," said the Doctor, "that eliminates a nitrogen</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying explosive. I could smell traces of the fumes</seg><seg type="columnLine">1052</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">yet if one had been used. My nose is exceptionally sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitive to nitrogen oxides. Did you find any gas pipes ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is no gas in the building and I have tapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">every inch of the floor, walls and ceiling and there is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">place for the entrance of gas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a gas explosion all the same," replied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor positively. "Was there a recording thermometer</seg><seg type="columnLine">or hygrometer in the vault?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The president pointed silently to the two instruments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Probably wrecked by the explosion," remarked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor as he picked them up. "No they're not, they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">still working. Let's see the dials."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He studied the dials for some minutes in silence, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently making some mental calculations. He took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel tape from his pocket and measured the vault care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully and made some elaborate calculations on a pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">pad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is that stuff?" he said, suddenly pointing to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile of copper bars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That stuff was checked in by the bullion teller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunter, for gold last night," replied Carnes, "and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning after the explosion, it turns out to be copper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunter is under arrest for robbery and murder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why murder?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His assistant was killed by the explosion. You'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better let me tell you the whole story, Doctor," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carnes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, go ahead, I might as well let you get it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your system, before you blow up under the strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of holding it," he replied seating himself on the copper</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars and preparing to listen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you any report on the bank guards ?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Carnes had finished his story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing definite. The three who carried in the bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">are all retired enlisted men of the Army with excel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent reputations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about the shipment?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Regular in every way. The stuff was assayed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in sight of an armed messenger from that time on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the messengers wTho traveled with it has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the express company for twenty years. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">one has only been with them for about a year and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are working on his record, but so far it has been per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly clear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was Hunter doing last night ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was with his fiancee.

"Was there any</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad weather here last night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a calm beautiful night," replied the president.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Funny time to have static trouble," remarked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know that she said that it was static," an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered Carnes.

"Carnes, what did you say</seg><seg type="columnLine">the names of those express messengers were?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't say," replied Carnes, "but the name of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">older man is Fowler and the younger is named Wallace."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wallace?" asked the Doctor, "Is he a hunchback?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No indeed, he's quite tall and very straight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It can't be the same man then, although it might ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain a great deal," he said. He paced the floor for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments muttering the name "Wallace" under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. Suddenly he turned to Carnes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I may be crazy or I may not," he said. "At any rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is more to this case than appears on the surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carnes, go out and buy me a radio set. Any sort of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three tube set will do, provided it works on a loop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Get tubes and batteries and everything needed to put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in operation. Also get me a hacksaw and half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">blades and a bottle of strong ammonia."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE Carnes was gone, the Doctor busied him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in taking from the cases he had brought with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him several instruments and setting them up on a table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the time he had finished, Carnes arrived loaded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Carnes," he said, "give me the saw and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammonia and set up your set. When you get it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation, tune in any local station to make sure that it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">working right and then set it at 450 meters and let it</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. I'm going to examine these bars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moistened his handkerchief with ammonia and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed the surface of one of the bars briskly. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the handkerchief had turned blue he examined it care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully under a binocular microscope, but turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an exclamation of disappointment. He took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hacksaw and sawed one of the bars in halves and scru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinized the sawn surface under a powerful glass. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered his disappointment and took up a pinch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the copper dust made by the saw. This he dissolved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an acid that he drew from one of his bags and put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution in a small glass tube which he set up in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his instruments. A moment later a tinny arc began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spark behind the tube, and simultaneously the radio set</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave off a raucous tearing sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut that thing off," he directed as he applied his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye to an eyepiece projecting from the instrument. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did so, he emitted a low whistle of surprise and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulted a book which he took from the instrument carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing case. He whistled again and looked long and ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nestly through the instrument. Again and again he ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justed it, testing it with standard solutions taken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his cases, but his astonishment grew momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily more manifest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" asked the president breathlessly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What? Oh, that? That's a simple electric arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectroscope. When you volatilize an element in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc, it gives a certain characteristic set of colored lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the prism. Every element has its own set and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">two are alike. It's one of the most certain methods of</seg><seg type="columnLine">detecting small traces of a foreign element. Those bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">are copper all right, but the lines aren't quite in place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keep still a minute and let me think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some minutes he paced the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It isn't possible," he said at length, "and yet it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. At any rate, we'll have to take a chance on it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carnes, my arrival in Philadelphia must be kept a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete secret. This is very important.

But I don't understand what it's all about."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If I'm right, you will tomorrow. If I'm wrong you</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably never will," replied the Doctor with a laugh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now let's go to bed and get some sleep.

Early in the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing he telephoned Frankford Arsenal and made arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments for keeping the Camp Vail truck. With nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do, he sat in his room and listened in vain for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tearing sound from his radio. He had a strong desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to telephone the 'Bellevue-Stratford/ but his previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">association with Dr. Bird tended to discourage him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor always preferred to work in an atmosphere of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery in order, as he put it, "to be able to revel in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">successes and to bury his failures."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At six he left his room long enough to snatch a bite</seg><seg type="columnLine">to eat. As he left the restaurant a newsboy came down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street crying an extra. Carnes bought one and read,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under huge headlines, an elaboration of the item the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor had written the night before. He hastened back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his hotel in hopes of a message, but none awaited him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and his telephone was silent until nearly seven-thirty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then it rang and he literally jumped for the receiver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that you, Carnes ?" asked the voice at the other end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wire. "This is Griffen. We'll pick you up at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of Ninth and Chestnut in about fifteen minutes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watch out for an army truck and board it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Carnes boarded the truck, which slowed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him, he found Fleckner and Dr. Bird in the cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered body with two men dressed in the olive drab of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">army. A glance forward showed him that the driver also</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore a uniform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Carnes," said the Doctor. "Make yourself at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. This is Sergeant Welman of the Signal Corps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the best radio direction finders that the army has.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Give Carnes a headset, Sergeant, he might as well get</seg><seg type="columnLine">in on the fun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it all about?" asked Carnes as he adjusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the headset and began to receive WIP's evening pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gramme.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll find out in time/' replied Dr. Bird with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckle. "Meanwhile, enjoy the music auid listen for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything unusual."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The truck wandered aimlessly up and down the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Carnes settled himself to wait. He saw that all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other occupants of the truck were wearing headsets</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were connected to a large receiver surmounted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loop that stood on an elevated platform built in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the truck. From time to time, the Sergeant</seg><seg type="columnLine">would adjust the dials of the receiver, tuning in a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">station, only to tune it out again in a few minutes. Half</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour passed in this way and then the Sergeant turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Doctor Bird.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you sure that you have that wave-length right?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's right as nearly as Miss Moulton could tell me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If it shows up at all, we ought to get it for she said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it covered the whole dial."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems funny that more people didn't hear it," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the Sergeant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it's what I think it is, it would be very easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapped," replied the Doctor.

Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">I may be-- What's that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That" was a peculiar rending, tearing sound in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head sets that drowned out everything else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop her," called the Sergeant to the driver. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved his headset and held it at some distance from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear while he manipulated the loop mounted on top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiver. The sound increased in intensity and the Ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geant began to work on his fine adjustment. For sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral minutes Carnes could detect no difference in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensity of the sound and at last even the Sergeant was</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied. A flashlight glowed for an instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fifty-three-point-six, uncorrected," he announced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Got the location, Kelley?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His companion grunted an assent and the Sergeant</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to the driver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take the next turn to your left and go straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The truck had not moved over two blocks before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound suddenly died out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's stopped," said the Sergeant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I doubt it," replied the Doctor.

"We are locating the source of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sound you heard in your headset. This is a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensitive receiver equipped with a loop and by turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">it until we get the maximum intensity of sound, we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to lay off a line on which the sending station must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. By getting several of these lines from different</seg><seg type="columnLine">points, we are able to locate the transmitter. It must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the intersection of the lines."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can see that," replied Fleckner, "but what has it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do with this case ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know, sir," said the Sergeant.

The truck stopped at length at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner of Eleventh and Chestnut and the Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed out, followed by the Sergeant, who carried what</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a suitcase with a loop on top in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, Carnes," called the Doctor. "I think we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are going to find our man now.

Listen and get this straight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sergeant Welman will lead us to a door on the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of which will be the sending set that we have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">locating.

Just obey</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders and everything will be all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they started down the street, Sergeant Welman</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjusted a small pair of headphones attached to the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was carrying to his ears and took the lead. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to time he would set the case down, make a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjustments and then resume his onward progress.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before a large office building he paused and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped in through the entrance way. Up the stairs he</seg><seg type="columnLine">led them and down a corridor, stopping with increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequency to work on the case. At last he paused before</seg><seg type="columnLine">a closed door and pointed silently. The group listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could hear a faint crackling hum from behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. The Doctor drew his automatic and motioned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carnes to do likewise. Carnes drew his gun and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor, motioning him to follow closely, took hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the handle of the door and tried it. It yielded to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch and with a sudden effort, he thrust it open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered, Carnes and Fleckner following closely on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A CURIOUS scene met their gaze. The room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in semi-darkness save where it was illuminated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reading lamp set on a table. At the table sat two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending over a piece of apparatus from which a flicker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blue light came, accompanied by the crackling noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had heard outside. The room smelled strongly</seg><seg type="columnLine">of garlic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they entered, the two men sprang to their feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The nearer one wore some sort of a uniform, but no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed him, for the other figure completely dominated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene. He was a man who might have been tall had</seg><seg type="columnLine">he been straight, but whose hunched back reduced his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stature to a bare four feet. His short bandy legs formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a striking contrast to huge arms that hung nearly to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees. Topping this misshapen body was the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Grecian God, thin almost to emaciation. Huge black</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes like two burned holes in a blanket regarded the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truders with merciless intensity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good evening, Doctor Wallace," said Dr. Bird as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped forward. "I rather thought that I would find</seg><seg type="columnLine">you at the bottom of this. So far as I know, you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only man in the United States with the imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">to conceive a scheme like this or the brains to carry it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lips of Dr. Wallace curled in a thin-lipped wicked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why didn't I kill you before I started this?" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly to Dr. Bird. "I should have known that if I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only man able to carry out my experiment, that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be the only one who would be able to solve it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's where you did make a mistake," replied Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bird lightly. "Hold on there!" he cried suddenly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His movement was quick, but Wallace moved like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat. Before Bird could stop him he had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall and closed an electric switch. There was a» ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion and the instrument that had been on the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew to pieces. Carnes and Bird stood paralyzed for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment by the crash, but were galvanized into action as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the explosion was followed by the vicious cracking of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol that Wallace had drawn from his pocket. Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bird's pistol dropped from a bleeding hand, but Carnes'</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO ROBBERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1055</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gun woke to life* As it spat forth its message of death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wallace swayed for an instant and then pitched for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward on his face. Carnes kept both Wallace and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion covered while he backed toward the wall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">groped for a light switch. Fleckner interpreted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement correctly and aided him and an instant later</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene was brilliantly illuminated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wallace lay face downward in a pool of blood while</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companion stood with blanched face and elevated</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.

How</seg><seg type="columnLine">much do you know?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know a great deal," replied Dr. Bird, "but some</seg><seg type="columnLine">things puzzle me yet. If you are dying, why don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a clean breast of it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you want to know?" asked Wallace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did you get your synthetic gold into the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a Golconda shipment?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was easy.

In the same car were eight boxes of books which</seg><seg type="columnLine">really contained my stuff. He gave the other messenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">knockout drops and switched the bars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Simple," commented Carnes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did you polymerize that copper?" asked Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bird.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ghost of a smile appeared on Wallace's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I expect that you would like to know," he said, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll never find out.

The blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">gushed from Wallace's lips and his head fell for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.

How far his physical misfortunes</seg><seg type="columnLine">warped his morality is hard to tell. He may have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">more to be pitied than blamed. He worked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bureau for some time, but his ideas were far above our</seg><seg type="columnLine">routine work and he quit. I lost track of him and hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of him for several years when this case came up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I got to the bank and looked around, I real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized, of course, that the explosion was caused by gas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but my sense of smell is unusually acute and I could de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tect no trace of any unusual odor. Then I looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the recording hygrometer and the answer was plain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You gentlemen probably know that w'hen hydrogen gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">is mixed with air, it explodes quite violently, giving as</seg><seg type="columnLine">its only product of explosion, water vapor. The hygro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meter showed a sudden great increase in the amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water vapor in the air immediately after the explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I knew that it was caused by hydrogen gas.

Where the gold got out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that copper got in, hydrogen gas could get in too. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't an idea, so I started asking the first things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into my mind.

The group that attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">my attention was the second, which contains among</seg><seg type="columnLine">other elements, copper with an atomic weight of 63.6</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gold with a weight of 197. If we multiply 63.6</seg><seg type="columnLine">by three and add six, we get practically the atomic weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold.

His air of</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppressed excitement appeared to indicate that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly bursting with some kind of news, probably of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another of his long list of scientific achievements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To me, Dr. Beardsley had always been an interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">enigma. It was now almost twenty years since I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">first sat at his feet, one of his many admiring students</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the University. His lecture course in biological</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chemistry was among the most popular in the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">curriculum, principally because of the magnetic per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonality of the old physician. Yes--old he was, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those days--aged and stooped, with the weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than three score years on his narrow shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, despite his age, the doctor was a veritable tornado</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mental and physical energy. At a time when most</seg><seg type="columnLine">men have withdrawn from the whirlwind of struggle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strife, leaving the world of mad endeavor to younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and clever intellects, Dr. Beardsley was still to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in the front ranks. This indefatigable, almost in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaustible, dynamo of human energy still carried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the van of medical and educational achievement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grand old Dr. Beardsley! In those rosy days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">university life he was to us eager students an unending</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of joy and inspiration. To me he represented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the summation of mental vigor and physical magnetism.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were quite chummy together, and frequently he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vited me to come over to his laboratory and watch some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his experiments. Frankly, I was at a considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss as to the nature of most of them. To tell the truth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had elected Dr. Beardsley's lecture course for no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious a reason than that I needed the two points for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my graduation. And since the attractive personality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old prof. was one of the major topics of conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the campus, I determined to enroll in his subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even with my extremely meagre background of</seg><seg type="columnLine">biology and medico-chemistry I was still conscious, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those student days, of the phenomenal nature of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those experiments that the doctor was conducting. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast scope of his scientific investigations was a revela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He thought, worked and lived in terms of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">betterment and progress; his advances in the realm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">biological science contributed a substantial achievement</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I left college to enter newspaper work, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it that I did not lose contact with the aged professor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thanks to the smattering of medical and chemical infor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation that I had absorbed from being exposed to the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence of Dr. Beardsley both in his classes and in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory, my reportorial assignments frequently carried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1056</seg><seg type="columnLine">By</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">William</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lemkin,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ph.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Author of</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Cold Light"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">His features became distorted as if by</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unbearable pain. ...

Do you remember what</seg><seg type="columnLine">a howl of derision burst forth at Dr. Beardsley's blunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement that any adult of subnormal stature can now</seg><seg type="columnLine">add from six to eighteen inches to his height? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't that wave of scorn and ridicule turn almost over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night to the wildest acclaim when the modest scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstrated the soundness of even his most astonishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">assertion ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE might marvel at my intimate knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things medical and bio-chemical, considering that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am essentially a reporter, whose schooling along those</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines is of necessity highly limited if not absolutely nil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, I had the extreme honor and privilege of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first to convey the news of these revolutionary de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopments to the layman world through the medium of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my paper. For that reason I soaked up more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a superficial amount of information about the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying principles of these classic researches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And here I was again, lending a patient ear to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific discourse of the white-haired savant. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident in his very tone and demeanor that another of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his momentous pieces of research was soon to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of universal publicity and acclaim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now all medical men," continued Dr. Beardsley in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">faltering voice, "are pretty thoroughly convinced about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nature of these deficiency diseases. The classical</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigations of Mr. Collum, Eddy and others have</seg><seg type="columnLine">given conclusive proof that wrhen these mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitamines are absent from the diet, definite diseases</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow.

Suddenly the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">died in his throat in a strange gurgle, his eyes bulged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmingly, and his fingers clutched feverishly at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast. For a moment I thought the old man was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to collapse to the floor, and I leaped forward to support</seg><seg type="columnLine">his swaying body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He appeared to recover immediately, however, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved me back with a gesture of assurance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's my heart again, Paul," he whispered weakly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sank back into his chair.

Although I was beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the light of dawn, I ventured no rash theory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own? choosing rather to let him reveal the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his revolutionary discoveries without my inexpert as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All diseases," and the words came forth with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberate and forceful impact of sledge-hammer blow's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"to w'hich human flesh is heir--all of them are defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciency diseases!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Beardsley leaned back with the triumphant air of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a victorious warrior and regarded me closely to note</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect of this startling announcement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRANKLY, I was somewhat taken aback by the dar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the doctor's assertions. True I had learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from constant experience with the famous scientist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his astonishing methods always to expect the unexpected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All of the doctor's previous contributions to the scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the day had been in the nature of phenom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enal revelations. By their very unconventionality and</seg><seg type="columnLine">daring they were sufficient to leave one breathless with</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement. Yet this new proclamation, bolder and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">far-reaching in its scope than any that I had heard before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, to be candid, an extremely hard pill to swallow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But my dear Dr. Beardsley," I remonstrated, "do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize what you are saying? Are you not at one stroke</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattering traditions and beliefs that have been the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">basis of the science and art of medicine for generations ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you mean to imply that the absence of these mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous vitamines in our diet is the primary cause of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">human diseases?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Precisely that, Paul, only let me explain further.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't get an incorrect impression. The commonly ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted deficiency diseases which I mentioned at first are</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely due to a lack in the diet of the four or five</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitamines that we designate by letters at the beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the alphabet.

That seems like a rather bold generalization,</seg><seg type="columnLine">does it not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It appears that way to me," I replied. "Does that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that a disease such as, for example, diphtheria is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not caused by a germ at all, but by the lack of a specific</seg><seg type="columnLine">element in the diet which you classify under the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 'vitamines'?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's exactly it, my boy!" cried Dr. Beardsley. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are grasping the idea admirably. Of late, physicians</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been prone to swallow too readily the bacterial</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory of disease. Doctors have been too confident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all our human ills may be pinned onto the lowly micro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">organism. While I freely admit that a mass of appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently corroborative evidence has been adduced which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would lead the unwary and shallow thinker to the belief</seg><seg type="columnLine">that most diseases are caused by bacteria, I firmly main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that relatively crude and inaccurate methods of</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulation and experiment, coupled with a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision and a distorted perspective on the part of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists, have brought about the result that the germ</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory of disease has been foisted on a gullible world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and has been accepted as law by an overwhelming and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">universal acquiescence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From the very beginning of my work in medicine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and biological chemistry I refused to subscribe to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bacterial explanation of human and animal diseases. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent years the development of the study of vitamines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of their relation to the so-called deficiency diseases,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stimulated me to carry on an exhaustive investigation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire subject of foods and their composition, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope of extending our knowledge of these essential</seg><seg type="columnLine">nutrient elements. Of course all of this experimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">work has been conducted with the strictest precautions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrecy.

Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an idea which was truly unprecedented.

But I must confess that nothing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever of so startling a character as this iconoclastic theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Dr. Beardsley was now unfolding to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Proof! That's what the all important matter was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">now! Proof to give incontestible support to these new</seg><seg type="columnLine">beliefs.

Supporting</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself with the aid of a cane he shuffled nervously</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a door to the right and into the laboratory that</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjoined his study.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE professor's workshop presented the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance common to the inner sanctum of an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perimental scientist. A long laboratory table occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the entire length of one wall. Surmounting it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrere numerous shelves bearing rows upon rows of neatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">labeled bottles and flasks, some containing liquids of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange and striking hues. Nearby was a cabinet housing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of preserved biological and anatomical speci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mens in jars of assorted sizes and shapes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Occupying a corner of the laboratory were various</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of electrical equipment whose nature I was unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fathom. A number of physiological charts and pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures were distributed about the walls. On the laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">table was grouped a collection of chemical apparatus that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor had evidently used in a recent experiment. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized distilling sets with water condensers, extrac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion funnels, a Bunsen burner and several of the simpler</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimental materials with which I had been vaguely</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar many years ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, what struck me most forcibly as I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the laboratory on the heels of Dr. Beardsley was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer conglomeration of utterly unscientific noises that</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose from the far corner of the room. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chorus of chirps and gurgles mingled with shrill squeals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and occasionally a low growl that rose to a mournful</seg><seg type="columnLine">howl and then died again. One would readily imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself rather in a well equipped pet-store than in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">staid and solemn confines of a scientific laboratory,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 DIRECTED a questioning glance at the doctor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sensed my evident astonishment. With a knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile he hobbled over to the corner of the room from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the disturbance seemed to emanate, and I followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectantly. For the first time I now observed a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cages similar to those found in bird and animal stores.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In one of them some pigeons fluttered about, cooing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gurgling. Two others contained guinea-pigs, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">several colonies of white mice scampered around in ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacent cages. Other compartments of rather large dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions were screened, so as to hide their inmates from</seg><seg type="columnLine">view, but the strange noises that emerged from the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cesses of these mysterious cages were sufficient to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicate that they housed some forms of animal life in</seg><seg type="columnLine">captivity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You might have guessed by now," ventured the scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist by way of explanation, "that the animals constituting</seg><seg type="columnLine">this assorted menagerie are my test-tubes and beakers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my flasks and other chemical apparatus for the experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments which I am constantly performing.

"But the remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able things about these rats is that at the start of this ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment they were of precisely the same weight and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same stage of development.

Every day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each rat of group B receives in addition to its usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">food, two cubic centimeters of milk, equivalent to about</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of a thimbleful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I marveled at the astonishing results accomplished by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the addition of this insignificant, almost infinitesimal</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantity of milk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now let me go back," continued Dr. Beardsley, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recall to you some pertinent facts about nutrition in</seg><seg type="columnLine">general.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up to comparatively few years ago, we believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that our diet was perfect if it contained protein, fat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carbohydrates and mineral salts. Each of these has a</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite function in the body, and, with a diet comprising</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prime food elements in the proper proportion, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would appear that the human mechanism would continue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to operate at a point of maximum efficiency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now milk is our most nearly ideal food, containing</seg><seg type="columnLine">protein in the form of casein, fat in the form of cream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carbohydrates represented by milk sugar, and certain es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sential mineral salts, including the bone-building lime.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, these food elements are also found to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">present in the exact proportion to make an ideally bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anced diet. Hence milk has always been regarded as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finest kind of food for infants and growing animals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us assume, however, that instead of feeding our</seg><seg type="columnLine">body with milk, we supply it with the individual con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stituents of the milk, namely the protein, the fat, etc.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained from various sources, taking care, however, to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">furnish these nutrients in the exact proportion found in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the original milk. With our human engine receiving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient amount of the best protein obtainable, enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat and carbohydrate to satisfy the energy and fuel re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quirements of the body, and a sufficient supply of inor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganic salts, wre ought to thrive as well as we did on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original milk diet. ' Doesn't that appear to you to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonable form of argument?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The logic of the case seems to me to be irrefutable,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I replied. "An artificial diet such as you describe ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be every bit as wholesome and substantial as the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up of milk only."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True," continued the doctor, "and most scientists did</seg><seg type="columnLine">agree that there could be nothing inherently wrong in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">synthetic diet of this sort. And yet, look at the results</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained from maintaining these rats on just such a diet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The animals of set A have been fed on an artificial diet</seg><seg type="columnLine">consisting of protein, fat, carbohydrate and mineral</seg><seg type="columnLine">salts. Their undernourished and anaemic condition is ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious at a glance. On the other hand, compare the rats</seg><seg type="columnLine">of set B with them. Their diet has been identical with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the first group, consisting of the same synthetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixture of food nutrients, the only difference being the</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition of two five-hundredths of a pint of milk each</seg><seg type="columnLine">day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps, Dr. Beardsley," I ventured a guess, "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">additional nutrients in the milk added to the diet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">B rats are responsible for the increased growth and su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perior health of these animals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hardly, my boy!" was the scientist's prompt re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joinder. "As far as the most scrutinizing chemical</seg><seg type="columnLine">analysis could ascertain the minute quantity of whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">milk added to the diet of the B series contained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exact constituents of the synthetic diet. And surely, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual amount of food and energy material to be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the half thimbleful of milk is so inordinately tiny as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">preclude any possibility that the remarkable growth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the B rats can be ascribed to this additional nutriment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Scientists were therefore led to the undeniable con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion that there must be something present in the milk</seg><seg type="columnLine">other than the four essential nutrient elements already</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to be there. And a corollary inference was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitable, namely, that this mysterious substance must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be present in very minute proportions, since the amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">results exhibited by the rats of group B resulted from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the addition of a very small quantity of milk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is in short, Paul, the story of the discovery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitamine A, the vitamine found in the butter fat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">milk, as well as in several other common foods. It has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been proved to be the growth-promoting vitamine, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can readily see what the absence of this essential</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingredient in the diet of the rats in the first group has</seg><seg type="columnLine">effected as far as their rate of development and general</seg><seg type="columnLine">health is concerned."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, doctor," I asked timidly, "if, as you say, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment is an exact replica of one performed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted professor many years ago to demonstrate the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istence of vitamines, is there any particular point in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">repetition? Perhaps you have in mind some refinement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of manipulation, or some totally unsuspected angle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now you have it!" cried the aged experimenter, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">faltering voice rising to a higher pitch as he approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subject that w*as nearest his heart. "Remember that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chief interest at present is the matter of deficiency</seg><seg type="columnLine">diseases.

I want you now</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more, Paul, to examine carefully the rats of group</seg><seg type="columnLine">A, namely the undernourished animals, and tell me if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can detect any palpable evidences of the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disease."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONCE again I peered into the enclosure that housed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the anaemic rats. They were huddled together in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the centre of the cage, listless and inactive, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a somnolent stupor. Occasionally one of them would</seg><seg type="columnLine">move its head weakly, blinking its eyes in a half-hearted</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion. Evidently this exertion was too much for it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it would promptly sink back again into its mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bid lethargy. Without a doubt these animals appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be, even to my layman's eyes, subnormal. But a close</seg><seg type="columnLine">examination of the rats seemed to reveal to me no definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">indications of disease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was about to give up and turn to Dr. Beardsley for</seg><seg type="columnLine">elucidation, when I happened to take another glance at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the little animals as it blinked its eyes weakly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My attention was attracted by a queer reddening and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flammation of the rat's eyes with a formation of hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">crusts about the lids. I also noted a peculiar yellowness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pupil while the entire organ appeared to be weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lusterless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking carefully over the other five members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group, I found them all to be suffering from the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye malady, at various stages in its progress. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were afflicted with an accumulation of a sticky</seg><seg type="columnLine">exudate that tended to paste the eyelids together. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of two of the rats this sticky material had dried into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crust, which made it difficult for them to get their eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lids open. One of the little animals appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering from the development of ulcers on the corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the eye, and it was obvious that the creature was</seg><seg type="columnLine">totally blind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the rats were certainly in a bad way with regard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the state of their eyes. This was the pathological condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, no doubt, to which the old scientist had reference.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could have kicked myself for nearly tripping up on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing which now appeared so ridiculously evident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see that your powers of scientifice observation are</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming more acute," chuckled the doctor as he noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dawning expression in my eyes. "That characteristic</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye disease is known as ophthalmia, and is a definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">deficiency disease resulting from the absence in the diet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vitamine A. The ailment has been found to develop</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well in human beings, although in such cases it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">known as xerophthalmia, and sometimes as conjunctivitis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This form of eye inflammation often progresses to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent where total and permanent blindness results.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can see for yourself that at least one of my test</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals has reached that point already. Very often</seg><seg type="columnLine">death results before the blindness stage is attained."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doctor Beardsley now hobbled across to a nearby cabi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">net and returned with a small vial containing an oily</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid of a faintly pink hue, together with a device which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gathered to be a hypodermic needle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up to the present time," he continued, "all efforts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolate the various vitamines have met with no marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">success. It is true that my colleagues in this field of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific research have, with their crude and elementary</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods of experimentation, isolated certain materials of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a high degree of activity, which are claimed to be im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pure forms of the vitamines. To the best of my knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, however, not one of them has yet been able to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world 'Here is a sample of pure, undiluted, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred per cent vitamine A.' And the same applies</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally well to vitamines B, C, D and E.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "However, I have, after ceaseless effort on the subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">extending over a period of four years, at last succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in perfecting a method or rather a series of methods for</seg><seg type="columnLine">detecting, isolating, purifying and identifying each indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual vitamine. The exact nature of these methods I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am not yet prepared to divulge. Suffice it to say that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">now have in my possession samples of the five commonly</seg><seg type="columnLine">known vitamines, together with eighteen hitherto undis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered members of this group of essential food sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances. Each is in the highest form of chemical purity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each exhibits the precise physical characteristics of</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiling point, melting point and vapor tension as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a definite molecular weight, to indicate that it is a pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical compound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now' I am going to demonstrate to you something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the remarkable therapeutic properties of pure vitamine</seg><seg type="columnLine">A. Not only is it a preventive for its characteristic</seg><seg type="columnLine">deficiency diseases, but it is a cure as well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Beardsley then proceeded to draw up one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">drops of the precious pink liquid into his needle. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">chose one of the rats that exhibited an intermediate stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the eye disease, and prepared a spot on its neck for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">injection, taking the usual precautions in regard to anti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">septic conditions. Then followed a deft jab, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple operation was over, after which the creature was</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced with its fellows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a brief moment we watched the test animal in</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained silence--the scientist with a look of mingled</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety and triumph in his faded eyes--I with a feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a momentous occurrence was about to take place. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected something out of the ordinary, but I was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely taken back by the startling outcome of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the space of about ten seconds the rat continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drowse with his mates in that characteristic state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull torpidity from which it had not even been disturbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the intravenous injection of the doctor. Then it sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly opened its eyes, not sluggishly and weakly as be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, but with a vivacious snap, and I was astonished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the sticky secretion and the hard encrustations on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyelids slowly melt away in the face of a gentle tearlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">flow that began to bathe the afflicted eyes of the rodent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even more remarkable than this almost miraculous</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformation was the change in the physical behavior</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the animal itself. It rose to its feet from the crouch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and huddled position that it had occupied with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors, and began scampering about the cage with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">liveliness and vigor, that was in sharp contrast to the al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most deathlike somnolence of the other rats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even if I had been able to think of something appro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">priate to say at this juncture, I was unable to utter a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrord for sheer bewilderment at the awe-inspiring phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenon that was taking place before my very eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All I could do was to stare in open-mouthed and open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed amazement at the revitalized animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that isn't by any means all!" These words of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Beardsley seemed to come booming from afar, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook me out of my hypnotic trance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have witnessed only the very beginning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformation," smiled the aged professor.

If he could per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form such unheard-of acts in the case of dumb animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their peculiar afflictions, what a far-reaching boon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to humanity would he evolve, when he applied his magical</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitamines to the host of human ills! The very thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it was sufficient to stagger my imagination and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">send my intellect reeling in a state of dizzy helplessness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">VITAMINE Z</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1063</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;CT HAVE made certain secret arrangements," whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">X pered Dr. Beardsley to me in the lobby of the Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versity Hospital where we met as agreed at three o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following afternoon. "Dr. Horton is in accord with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my work, and has given me full permission to try out</seg><seg type="columnLine">several of my newer vitamines in the treatment of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">common human diseases."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed significantly to the little black bag he</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried, and murmured: "Vitamines J, P and R--to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether with a few of my more recently isolated ones."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He appeared to be shaky and nervous, as though he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not slept the night before, or perhaps many nights before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His sunken cheeks were even more sallow than ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">narily, while deep rings under his eyes indicated long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wearying labor of a strenuous nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps it is unnecessary for me to go into any great</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail as to the phenomenal occurrences to which I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness during the course of the next two hours.

You will then obtain a pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of what transpired in the grim wards of this institu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of human suffering and physical pain. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstration was over I wras breathless and shaken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We first spent a little time in the children's ward. Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beardsley tackled at the start an exaggerated case of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantile scurvy, a little girl whose body joints had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflamed and sore, and whose gums exhibited such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked swelling and softening that the teeth could almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">be plucked out #with little effort. Within five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the time that the doctor administered an injection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his pure vitamine C, the child was romping around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crying to be allowed to go outdoors and play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An advanced case of poliomyelitis, a disease affecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spinal cord, responded to treatment within three</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes following an injection of vitamine R. In about</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten minutes the little boy was strutting about the ward in</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncontrollable glee, entirely oblivious of the fact that for</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks he had lain helplessly paralyzed from the hips</seg><seg type="columnLine">down--a case of infantile paralysis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Proceeding to other parts of the hospital this extra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary man left a trail of bewildered patients, or I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should say former patients, nearly shocked out of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses by a heaven-sent cure. A virile stage of typhoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever answered to treatment so promptly that in ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes the erstwhile sufferer was sitting up and clamor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing vociferously for a square meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An unfortunate woman in the final eruptive stages of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallpox was soon up and about in a most energetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion. Hardly had a hopeless tubercular patient re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived an intravenous injection of vitamine M than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">put in a loud demand that he be given his clothes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly be discharged from the hospital. I followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Beardsley from ward to ward, helping whenever I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could in the manipulation of the treatments, standing by</seg><seg type="columnLine">in open-eyed amazement when my assistance was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">required.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally his supply of precious vitamines was exhausted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see plainly that the physician's very meagre re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve of vital energy was similarly exhausted. His thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame trembled alarmingly as I helped him into the wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cab, and he dropped into the cushions with a sigh of</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could not muster up the proper words with which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">(express my feelings at the superhuman demonstration</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had witnessed.

"Ah---vitamine Z!--vitamine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Z!" he muttered half to himself. He appeared to be un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of my presence. Then with a start his eyes opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he regarded me with a queer look. His wrinkled old</seg><seg type="columnLine">face broke into a weak smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> &lt;You must forgive this little digression," he whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am tired, very tired.

Meantime you will of course breathe not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of this to anybody. I have enjoined the medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">staff at the hospital to maintain a strict secrecy regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">my cures this afternoon, and they will suppress all news</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my discoveries until the time is ripe for public an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And when I present the last act in my vitamine drama</seg><seg type="columnLine">I guarantee you that all the other remarkable things which</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have witnessed will pale into insignificance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I assisted him up the steps of his dwelling and, after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief good-night, I stood listening to his retreating foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps shuffling wearily down the long corridor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a genius that man is!"

Deep lines of anxiety furrowed his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his dry parchment-like skin was a sickly yellow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only his eyes seemed to burn under their shaggy brows</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a fierceness that almost frightened me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, my dear Paul, it is true that I have been working</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard--perhaps too strenuously for my poor old heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But," and the doctor's face screwed itself up into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing grin, "I shall soon fix that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My work is now complete," he cried. "That hopeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream of the ancient alchemists, that evanescent vision of</seg><seg type="columnLine">1064</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ponce de Leon, the Elixir of Life!

I have isolated and dem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onstrated all the remaining vitamines. That was a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">task. If each of these substances is a preventive and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cure for a particular human disease, then what would a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixture of them be? Why, a remedy for every known</seg><seg type="columnLine">ailment!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I soon found that some mysterious influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">operated to vitiate the individual powers of these sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances when mixed together.

Vitamine Z--the very embodiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the virtues possessed by its host of cousin vitamines</seg><seg type="columnLine">--extracted from the manioc root of the West Indies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">South America by a process of refinement that has never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been equalled in the annals of science.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vitamine Z will cure any disease, known or unknown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what is the most dreaded of all diseases?

All hail to vitamine Z,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the real Elixir of Life!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment I thought the old man had gone stark</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad. His shrieking voice, his wild flashing eyes, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">me shrink back in a sudden panicky fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Once more," continued the agitated doctor, "I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">employ our little rat friends here in a demonstration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new vitamine.

Its head was drooped, its half-closed eyes evinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">a haunting fear, its hair was shaggy and dull. It could</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely totter, and after a few feeble steps it collapsed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heap and lay panting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_ "In age," explained the doctor, in a somewhat modified</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone, "this animal corresponds to a man of about eighty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As you can plainly observe, it is in a pretty sorry state--</seg><seg type="columnLine">in almost as pitiful a condition," he added with a dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, "as my own."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here is a vial of my vitamine Z.

Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">head was held high, and it seemed to take a lively interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world about it. Its bodily carriage became erect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its legs lost their tremblings. Even its lusterless</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat began to grow smooth and shiny. Its entire manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly became keen and aggressive. I am certain that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if there had been a cat present in the laboratory, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejuvenated rat would have done battle with her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocious abandon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Beardsley hastily seized the transformed animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thrust it back into its cage, where it fell to struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisily with the other inmates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he turned to me with a beaming smile of victory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His haggard face, seared with the lines of endless labor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and anxious ordeals became fairly radiant in his supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiasm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There you have the essential nucleus--the vital heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all my laborious work," he croaked hoarsely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vitamine Z will eliminate from this earth all disease,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all suffering, all the infirmities of old age.

"What are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief causes for human beings dying at less than one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred or two hundred years? You, as a scientist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anthropologist, must realize that, judged by biological</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws and precedents, human beings should live normally</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one hundred and fifty years, more or less--approxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mately five times the period it requires for them to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">maturity.

"Accidents take their toll, and death is hastened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the case of civilized men, by excesses, lack of care,</seg><seg type="columnLine">late hours, and a thousand and one other causes. But in</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to your first question, I would say that tubercu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">losis, cancer and--well, possibly malaria, are the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">most potent factors in destroying human life prema-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turely; that is, of course, excepting wars, pestilences,</seg><seg type="columnLine">floods and--as the insurance companies put it--acts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">God."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Precisely, amigo" he agreed. "And if these diseases</seg><seg type="columnLine">--if all maladies caused by parasitic or deadly germs</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be eliminated, why shouldn't people live to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred or more? And why shouldn't they keep their</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth into what we call middle age ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No reason at all," I admitted. "But no one has yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the chances are no one ever will eliminate such dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eases."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No?" Ramon shrugged his shoulders and raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyebrows. "In that," he continued, "you are greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken. Here in Urquin there are no germ or microbe</seg><seg type="columnLine">diseases. That is," he hastened to add, "unless you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have brought them in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense!" I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense nothing," he retorted. "Just use your rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, amigo mio. Remember that we--all the people here</seg><seg type="columnLine">--are, according to your former standards, tiny, ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">microscopic beings. Then, considering that point, tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me how it would be possible for germs--say of malaria--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live in our veins? Why, mi amigo, it would be like</seg><seg type="columnLine">tadpoles in the blood of ordinary-sized men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I smiled. "You quite forget," I reminded him, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">.when the Manabis--no, confound it, the Urquins--</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE GREEN PRISM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1069</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were reduced, the germs in their systems would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been reduced also, and that their descendants would still</seg><seg type="columnLine">be of reduced size."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Granted," he retorted. "But you, amigo, forget that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most deadly of germs, those of malaria, yellow fever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cholera, plague and others, can be transmitted, propa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gated only by means of carriers--insects. And that, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no carriers, the breed would soon die out and disappear</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely. And that, my friend, is precisely what oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred here. For all I know, the original ancestors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these people may have been entirely free of any injurious</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerins. But that makes no difference. It happens that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no carriers--no fleas, no mosquitoes, no bedbugs, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">biting insects are here. You see, the people were in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple when the calamity occurred, and probably no</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects were present. But--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about the dog we reduced?" I asked. "Didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">he bring fleas with him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you recollect," he reminded me, "we had the cur</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my laboratory for a week or more, and as I am, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunately, or rather was--very susceptible to fleas, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">most thoroughly defleaed him as well as my quarters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I doubt if there was a living flea in the place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hmm," I muttered, "I can understand, in a measure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the freedom from diseases of some sorts here. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are others--smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, cancer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pneumonia, scores of virulent maladies, that do not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quire carriers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madre de Dios!" exclaimed Ramon. "Did not you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself, assure me that all or nearly all of these w^ere</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduced to America by the Europeans? And do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">not realize that the Urquins were reduced ages before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first European arrived in America?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even so," I argued, for I hated to let him know he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had me, "I fail to see how that fact would enable a man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live two hundred years.

"A slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your pet science. But I can't blame you; you haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same interests here as I have."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If," I said, "I could find a--er--companionable young</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, as beautiful--no, that is imposible; but, let us say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite reasonably lovely, and, well, possibly not more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty or seventy years of age--and provided she were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not adversely iinfluenced by personal appearances, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might--well, I might consider acquiring much the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">interests as you possess here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramon laughed merrily. "Very possibly you may find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that that is just what will happen," he declared. "Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Melik has a really charming daughter, though I doubt if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she is much over fifty, and having had ample opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of judging what a most excellent husband I have proved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I imagine that Mosock Nina might be tempted to try the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment of acquiring a mate from the outside world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll have an opportunity to judge of the--er--girl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty summers this evening.

And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel certain it's the truth, for it answers all the require-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of the case. But we'll have to wait until later, old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Here comes your future bride."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Woman, the Enigma</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">POSSIBLY, under the circumstances, it may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">both ungallant and inadvisable to admit it, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">being a true and unvarnished narrative of actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">events I must not evade facts. Iri short, I must admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Mosock Nina did not, at first glance, stir any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"new fires" her name implied. But of course, with Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liche for comparison, no woman would have appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusually beautiful. Also, very possibly--though quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconsciously--I was influenced by having--also uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciously, surrounded myself with a defensive armor, if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">may use the simile, of determination not to fall a victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">to any woman's wiles or appearances. Mosock Nina was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, a really beautiful woman. Although Ramon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had declared she was at least fifty, I could not, even after</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lucid and quite reasonable explanation, believe she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than twenty-five or six. Her skin was of much</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same shade as Naliche's, a soft, warm, golden hue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was not surprising, as it developed that the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">women were cousins. Her hair was very luxuriant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft, and although black, it showed brown or reddish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even golden, tints in the light. Her features were those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her father, softened and refined by youth and femi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninity; her eyes were large, soft and expressive, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure was superb. In any other place and amid any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other surroundings I should have felt--as I afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt--that she was a most gloriously lovely woman, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I soon found that she was as merry, as companionable</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as delightful as any man might wish. And she quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously did not judge by appearances only, for she</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared quite--I might say decidedly--interested in me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, to cut a long story short, before the evening, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might say afternoon, for darkness in Urqui meant bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, I found, quite to my surprise and somewhat to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismay, that I had fallen deeply in love with Mosock</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nina and, if I could judge of the matter, that my feelings</seg><seg type="columnLine">were reciprocated. I do not think it essential to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrative to dwell upon the subsequent events nor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">describe matters that, I feel, hold no interest for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, and which, to my mind, were strictly of a private</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must confess, however, that, during the ensuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks, I found that my interest in archeology became,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to my surprise, a matter of secondary considera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">1070</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and I quite agreed with that anonymous personage</seg><seg type="columnLine">who advised that, if business interfered with pleasure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one should give up business. Nevertheless, I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely neglect my research work, and even dragged my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind from thoughts of Mosock Nina and kept Ramon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his promise to tell me of his discovery regarding the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Incan cyclopean architecture. As some of my readers</seg><seg type="columnLine">may not be familiar with this subject, a few words of</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation may not be amiss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout the interior of Peru and Bolivia are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains of immense cities, huge forts, massive walls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">great buildings, all constructed of stones of such stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendous size that they appear as if erected by a race of</seg><seg type="columnLine">giants. Often these stones weigh from thirty to two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred tons and even more, and all are fitted together with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such incredible nicety and precision--even where there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are as many as twenty angles--that although no mortar</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor cement was used, a knife blade cannot be inserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them today.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That they were erected by a highly civilized and cul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured people, who lived and vanished ages before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Incan civilization, is evident, for even the Incans had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">traditions or history of their origin, but attributed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the gods. And for years, since archeologists first</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied the Peruvian remains, they have proved a puzzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an unsolved mystery to all scientists. No one ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been able to offer a plausible theory to explain how</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were cut and fitted, how they were transported from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distant quarries, or by what means they were lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">--without the aid of modern machinery--and placed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hence, Ramon's casual statement that he had solved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mystery of the Cyclopean architecture, as it is called,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his assurance that he knew the secret so long un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved, filled me with the most intense interest, an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est that was not entirely submerged in my sudden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly unexpected interest in Mosock Nina. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened to Ramon's words when at last I pinned him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to his promise and he told me of his truly amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and altogether incredible solution of the mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You remember, amigo" he said, "that I once declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">--when we were in Manabi--that I had a feeling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute gold beads and the titanic stones had some con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded assent. "But that is ridiculous," I declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are no such immense stones in the neighborhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Manabi."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't interrupt--miigo mio " he smiled. "And don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">declare anything ridiculous. Judged from the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of your fellow scientists, your own status at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present time--if described to them--would be dubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible and ridiculous. Nothing, amigo, is impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor ridiculous in this world unless it controverts the laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Nature. And as none of us know what these laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">are, we are wholly incompetent to judge of what is and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is not impossible. Anyhow, as I was about to say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was not so far of? in my 'hunch/ as you might call it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is not, I may assure you in order to set your mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">at rest, any real connection between the microscopic gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">beads which--thank God--were the indirect means of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">present happiness, and the Cyclopean stonework. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is a very definite connection between the manner in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the beads were made and the stones were cut and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed. It----■"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again I interrupted him. "You mean the stones were</seg><seg type="columnLine">permanently enlarged after cutting,. I suppose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, on the contrary, just the reverse," he replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The stones at Cuzco and elsewhere are today their</seg><seg type="columnLine">original size or very near it. They were permanently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">physically magnified, cut and fitted, and then reduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their normal dimensions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I snorted. "That's going too far, Ramon," I objected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"In the first place, you proved conclusively that minerals</seg><seg type="columnLine">--nothing not an animal substance--could not be reduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Manabinite prisms. Take your fiddle, my clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dog's plate. You tried and failed. And----"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on!" he exclaimed. "Like all scientists, you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumping at conclusions. I was not, I confess, able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduce objects not composed of animal matter. But that</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not prove that, had I enlarged such objects, I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have found that the prism would reduce them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their original or normal size. And how do you or I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that, under certain conditions or when subjected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some peculiar vibratory stimulant, Manabinite might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be capable of reducing any material to the same ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent that the prisms we employed reduced animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hmm," I muttered. "I see your point. Possibly you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are right. But everr so--even if the ancients increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size of the stones to any extent, I fail to see why it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would facilitate cutting or fitting them. On the contrary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should declare without the least hesitation that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">render the task even more difficult. No human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">could move one of those two-hundred-ton blocks if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were three or four times as large. And to cut and fit a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large stone is far more difficult than to do the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">work on a small stone. No, no, Ramon, your explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far is not logical."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE smiled condescendingly. "Your reasoning is en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely wrong," he declared. "First let me ask you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few questions. What is weight? Why are some sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances lighter than others? Why, for example, is sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone lighter than flint? Why is marble softer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">granite ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, why," I stammered, suddenly realizing it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather difficult matter to give a wholly satisfactory reply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Weight, my dear boy, is a--well, a--a term used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">express the comparative--well, weights of various sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances. It is--why, the comparative pull of gravitation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upon various materials and bodies. It-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a bit," he interrupted. "Accepting your some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what lame explanation of weight in the abstract, how,</seg><seg type="columnLine">may I ask, is weight established ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, by specific gravity," I replied. "By-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And," interrupted Ramon, "why does one object have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a greater specific gravity than another? Why does one</seg><seg type="columnLine">material float on water while another sinks ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any schoolboy could answer that," I retorted. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">object that floats, if pushed under, displaces a volume</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of water exceeding its own weight. It-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I might state that your answer is no more spe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cific than the gravity you are prating about," he declared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupting my sentence. "You go around and around</seg><seg type="columnLine">in circles. You get no nearer the truth. The fact is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that weight, as you call it, is all bunk. It's all a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of relativity, and its relativity depends entirely upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the degree of space--I say space in a broadly compara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive term only, for of course there is no such thing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">space---between the atoms of which the material is com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed. If the atoms, electrons or whatever you please</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call the objects that form all substances, are pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE GREEN PRISM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1071</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">closely together, we have a dense, heavy material. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are widely separated we have a porous, light</seg><seg type="columnLine">material.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And when I say dense or porous I mean dense or</seg><seg type="columnLine">porous and not hard or soft. As a rule, I admit, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense material is far harder than the porous material,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there are exceptions. Gold and platinum are very</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense, yet they are soft, whereas certain forms of glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">and certain minerals may be porous, light and exceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly hard. But, invariably, the dense substances are, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would express it, heavy, and the porous substances</seg><seg type="columnLine">are comparatively light. You know that yourself. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">porous woods are light, the dense woods heavy and, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases where the usual rule is borne out, the dense object</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the harder. But, even in cases where the dense object</seg><seg type="columnLine">is comparatively soft--as in the case of lead, tin, copper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold, platinum, etc., the material would be far softer if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were rendered more porous. Lead or gold, for ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample, if as porous as--well, say wood--would be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft or softer than putty. In fact, I doubt if the adhesion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the atoms would be sufficient to hold them together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would probably disinegrate completely. But that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amigo, has no real bearing on my discovery. The pith of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter is this: if a normally hard, dense substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be so altered that the atoms composing it were sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arated, it would become a porous and soft substance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would it not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should not care to express a definite opinion in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gard to that," I evaded. "But assuming it to be a fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what of it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything!" he retorted. "You can break soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandstone with your fingers, but you can make no impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion upon granite without a steel tool. Why? Because</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one case you have a porous rock with loose structure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while | in the other case it is a dense rock with closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed together structure. But if by some means you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could separate the molecules of the granite to the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent that those of the sandstone are separated, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could crumble the granite as readily as you can the sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. Do you admit that ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded assent, but I was not sure he was right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine, amigo!" he ejaculated. "For once you cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise a valid or an invalid objection based on what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">call 'science/ But to proceed. That, my friend, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">precisely what the builders of cyclopean architecture</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. They expanded the stones of hard, dense, refrac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory rock until they were porous, soft, and could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked with the greatest ease. Then they reduced them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to normal size. That was all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," I cried, "you completely forget that if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">andesite or arsenite or granite was enlarged until your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypothetical cutting became possible, the stones would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">too cumbersome, far too heavy to handle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramon burst into laughter. "Back to the old school-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy ideas of weight," he exclaimed. "Haven't you just</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted that weight was basically a matter of compari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, of the specific gravity, as you call it? Haven't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted that if a substance floated on water it was light;</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it sunk it was heavy; that if it was porous it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">float; if dense it would sink? In that case, amigo, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">could the same block of andesite, even if enlarged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten times its size, one hundred, one thousand times its</seg><seg type="columnLine">size, be any heavier than the original block."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord!" I gasped. "I'm beginning to see. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisely put, you mean that the enlarged block would con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain no more material--no more atoms of material, than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the original? By heavens, Ramon, I never thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. I do believe you may be right. But--but why, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are, if an enlarged mass of stone would be light in</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct relation to its size--in other words, if its displace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment were greater than its weight of water, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually float. By Jove, Ramon, that might solve another</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery: how the Tiahuanacans transported their stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendous stones across Lake Titicaca. Why, man alive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they were first enlarged as you suggest, they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been rafted across as easily as logs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramon was grinning. "Of course they could and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were," he assured me. "And if you don't believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">it I can prove it to you. But to go on with my tale of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">discoveries. I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait. Hold on!" I cried, as a new thought entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind. "Your theory can't be right. It's a poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">rule that doesn't work both ways. If a stone enlarged</seg><seg type="columnLine">would weigh less, then a stone, a body, anything reduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">would weigh more. And if enlarging the stone renders it</seg><seg type="columnLine">more porous, then reducing it would render it more dense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In that case your body and mine would be as dense, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard as diamond, and we would weigh thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds each."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramon fairly choked with laughter at my serious ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression as--quite without realizing it--I pinched myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if testing the density and hardness of my flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear, dear old friend," he said, "haven't I just</seg><seg type="columnLine">been at some pains to explain that the enlarged stone is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no lighter than in its original size. It weighs precisely</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same; but as it has a greater cubic volume, its weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as expressed in your units based on specific gravity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">appears less. If water were to be enlarged to the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent, you would find the stone sank as quickly as it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its normal state in normal water, and if a steel tool</seg><seg type="columnLine">were enlarged in the same ratio it would be as difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cut the stone with it as it was when in its original form.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's all a matter of relativity, my friend. The stone is</seg><seg type="columnLine">enlarged out of all proportion to its surroundings; hence</seg><seg type="columnLine">the results. The same holds true in the matter of reduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. With one exception. The same laws do not hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it comes to the action of manabinite on animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter. Why, I do not know. It is one of the many</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomena connected with the crystal. Possibly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms that form animal matter are of a different charac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter from those of mineral and other substances and hence</seg><seg type="columnLine">are reduced to the same extent as the objects they form,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or possibly manabinite does not affect them the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. All I know is that it is so. But, as a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, I believe we weigh precisely what we weighed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore we were reduced. I----"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was my turn to laugh, and I did. "The idea, even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of a man of normal weight and only some thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandths of a millimeter in height, is," I declared, "highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusing, Ramon. And I suppose you claim that Mosock</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nina tops the scales at some one hundred and ten pounds,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less. I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we had scales in the same proportion to ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">as those to which you are accustomed are to ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans, I have no doubt you would find you weigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">around one hundred and seventy pounds, and that your</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiancee can boast of some one hundred and twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds of feminine loveliness. In other words, mi</seg><seg type="columnLine">amigo, your specific gravity in the water of Urquin would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be precisely the same as in the waters of New York if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were of your normal dimensions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bosh!" I cried. "Maybe you're all right and maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">1072</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not.

If----"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Meaning Mosock Nina, I presume," he interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a grin. "In which case," he added, "let me warn</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that you will find by experience that nothing you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have yet heard or seen can possibly equal the complica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of a woman's mind, and that nothing is so puzzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a woman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gave him a withering look and hurried off to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mosock Nina.	„</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ramon Proves His Point</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was not until some time later, after thinking over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ramon's statements, that I thought I found some</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaws in his arguments. If the stones had been en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larged as he claimed, why, I reasoned, would their atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be correspondingly enlarged? And if they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the enlarged stone would be as hard and dense as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in its original form. It was quite obvious, too, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his statement that in Urquin water we or I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same specific gravity as I formerly had in comparison</seg><seg type="columnLine">to normal water, must be wrong. He admitted, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, that in the case of animal matter the atoms com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posing it were proportionately reduced, and he had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained that the molecules of water, falling as rain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urquin, were incalculably small in proportion to ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">molecules. Yet the water in Urquin had not been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced, and how then could it bear the same relation to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, or to him, that ordinary water would bear to ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary men ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole thing puzzled me tremendously, and I lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake the greater part of the night trying to coordinate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the facts in my brain and to find some logical explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it all. But when, in the morning, I mentioned my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts and my inability to grasp or explain the seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly paradoxical and wholly contradictory matters, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely laughed and declared that it was a pure waste of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and nerves to bother trying to straighten it out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That we would have to accept facts as they were, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no more use striving to understand the inscrutable</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways of Nature than endeavoring to understand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally incomprehensible ways of women. A statement, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected, that hinted that his path of love and of marital</seg><seg type="columnLine">bliss was not wholly free from the ruts and thorns of</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. But I was not to be put off so readily. I pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sess a rather prominent bump of stubbornness when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes to baldly accepting theories without prima facie</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence of their truth, and I am something of a fiend</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the subject of demonstrations. So I very promptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed Ramon that while he might be willing to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept things as they were, or rather as they appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be, and though he might feel convinced that his expla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation of the mystery of the cyclopean architecture was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the correct one, I had my doubts, and was not at all ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accept his explanations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You always were a most skeptical chap, amigo/* he</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed me, "but there's nothing I enjoy more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">convincing a person against his will. I remarked yester-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day that I would prove my theory true--or at least prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">my contention in regard to the stones, and I'll keep my</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise. I do not know precisely what process the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Incas used, and Melik, who gave me the facts about the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stones, couldn't explain very clearly. But, working along</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own lines, and with what he had divulged to guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, I managed to invent a process that works, at least to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain extent, and I'll give you a demonstration."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fine!" I exclaimed. "I may be skeptical, but once I</seg><seg type="columnLine">see a thing with my own eyes, I am willing to be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced of anything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I observe," he remarked with a leer. "You were</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite convinced of Mosock Nina, once you had seen her</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your own eyes. And----"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She is most convincing," I interrupted. "And if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can show me anything in support of your theory that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-half as convincing as my future wife, I am willing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accept all your seemingly preposterous explanations."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'll find a woman is a darned lot more convincing</seg><seg type="columnLine">after marriage than before," he remarked dryly, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">come on. There is no time like the present, you know."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rather to my surprise, for he had not mentioned it, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that Ramon had quite a complete laboratory in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one wing of the big rambling palace. Of course he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacked many instruments and appliances that, ordinarily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are considered essential, but his marvelous inventive</seg><seg type="columnLine">genius, the skill and patience of the Urquins and his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical skill had served to provide makeshifts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">substitutes that were both serviceable and clever. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently his experiments had been mainly in the lines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">physics and optics--his own specialties--and equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously he had devoted most of his time to experiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">with manabinite, for partly finished, broken and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carded lenses, prisms and fragments of the mineral were</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered about in profusion. But of course this was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been expected for, as he told me, he had worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">assiduously and almost constantly to produce prisms</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of enlarging himself to normal size whenever I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might appear. And as I glanced about at his instruments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his store of the green crystal, it occurred to me that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he so desired, he might have enlarged not only him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self but Naliche and all the people at the same time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wondered why he had not done so. But when I put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question to him, he seemed surprised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should I ?" he demanded. "Would we--they--</seg><seg type="columnLine">be any better off? No, amigo, on the contrary, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be far worse off. What would we gain? We are</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy, contented, safe here. Why should I transfer</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself and my adopted people to a world of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they know nothing? To a status in which they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be lost ? And why should I sacrifice them to the dangers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discontent, the unhappiness of life and civilization as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew it? And, amigo mio, think of the effects of</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease? Through generations of freedom from ail</seg><seg type="columnLine">microbe diseases these people have lost the power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">resist germs, and the most ordinary ills--measles, colds,;</seg><seg type="columnLine">whooping cough or any others might prove fatal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly destroy them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," I objected. "There is no future, no progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. And at any instant the village and all of you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be totally destroyed. A flood, an earthquake, a shovelful</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sand, some burrowing animal or insect might wipe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">out Urquin and every one of its inhabitants. And-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I once said before, the same is equally true of</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence in the world of everyday men and women," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted. "And we do not face the dangers of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand-and-one things that other people have to guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">against. As for progress and the future, as you. call</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--uttter rot! What is progress? Merely another</seg><seg type="columnLine">name for discontent; making life and the world more</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE GREEN PRISM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1073</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and more complicated, more and more dangerous, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more unhappy. Are people any better off, any hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pier with motor-cars than they were with horses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriages ? Are they healthier or more at peace when</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to travel around the earth in a month than when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">required twice that time to cross the Atlantic? Do air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes bring any real advantages to mankind ? Are you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people of today--any happier, any more contented,</seg><seg type="columnLine">any better off, as far as peace of mind and body are con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned, than were our ancestors fifty, one hundred years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago ? I say no. For Dios, we are far worse off! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">more people have and the more they know, the more they</seg><seg type="columnLine">want and demand. It is a vicious circle. The laborer</seg><seg type="columnLine">demands more; to get more he forces his employer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay him more; his employer raises the price of necessi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties and luxuries to enable him to make his profit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet pay his help more, and as a result the artisan is as</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly off as ever. But he is caught in the mesh of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you call progress' and goes on, demanding and receiving</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, paying out equally more, getting more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">discontented, more sour, more unhappy. Madre de Dios,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where will it all end, this thing called progress? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the W'orst of it is, it gets nobody anywhere. Boiled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its basic elements, all man gets out of life is his food,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shelter, protection from the elements and amusements</seg><seg type="columnLine">that do not amuse. He-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on, Ramon/' I ejaculated. "How about knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, spiritual life, health, longevity, comforts?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE laughed sarcastically. "Of what use is your so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called knowledge if it cannot make life brighter or</seg><seg type="columnLine">happier?" he demanded. "And as. for life, I'll stake my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life that there is truer, purer, more enduring love right</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in Ur quin or among primitive savages, than you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">find in New York, London, Paris or anywhere in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">progressive civilizations. Spiritual life! Santisima</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madre, amigo, you amuse me! What spiritual life have</seg><seg type="columnLine">your progressives that we in Urquin lack? Nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have our faith, our religion, our gods, and we be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve in an after life, in souls, in a Creator and we live</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to the tenets of our religion, which is more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you can say of your civilized people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Comforts?

But enough of this. Let me prove my</seg><seg type="columnLine">statements about the stones."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he spoke, he adjusted a number of crude yet deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate instruments on a table or stand, selected several</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystals, arranged these with great care, and then picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a small slab or fragment of stone and handed it to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you will see," he began in the tone he once used</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lecture-room, "you hold a fragment of arseno-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pyrite rock or mispickel. I would ask that you examine</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with your pocket-lens and also that you test its hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness by means of this bronze too." He handed me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chisel-like instrument. "Then kindly drop the stone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this vessel of water. Ah, as you see, it sinks to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom instantly. Also, you find the bronze too makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">no impression upon the mineral, and your examination</seg><seg type="columnLine">by your lens has revealed a stone of fine, dense structure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you agree to all this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I laughed. "I am not, Ramon, a freshman in a class-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room," I reminded him. "Neither the lens, the chisel</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor the wrater were necessary to convince me that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">arsenopyrite, that a bronze instrument will not cut it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it will sink. Howrever-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grinned. "But I only wanted to be sure that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">question arose in your mind. Now," he continued, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the stone and placed it on a second stand between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of his instruments, "watch what happens."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he spoke, he picked up a contrivance something</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the old "bull roarers" of my boyhood days; a stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rod to which a string or cord bearing a weight, was at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached, and whirled it rapidly about. A low buzzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">hum resulted that increased in volume as he swung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing faster and faster,* until the sound was deafening</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the air vibrated in my ears. It wTas more like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of an airplane propeller than anything else but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sharper, more highly pitched note that reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">me of the song of gigantic cicada, and that seemed to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through and through me like an electrical di-scharge. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant the hum remained the same. Then, suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it soared in a high crescendo, and I gasped and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">back as there was a crackling explosive detonation from</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the stone had been placed. A shower of brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparks seemed to issue from the mineral, and it was en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped in a smoke-like vapor. It was precisely as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bunch of good-sized firecrackers had been set off on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly Ramon dropped the whirling stick, the hum</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased, and he turned to me grinning. "Nice fireworks,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remarked. "And made without fire at that. But just</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a look at the stone, amigo"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could scarcely believe my eyes. Where the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">slab had been--a piece of stone perhaps an inch square,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested an immense block of stone twice as high as my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, reaching across the entire width of the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully six feet in thickness. It was the most incredible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most uncannily mysterious happening I had ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But my amazement had only commenced. I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and examined the mass of stone, and uttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ejaculation of inexpressible wonder. Instead of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense, fine-grained mineral, I was looking upon what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was apparently coarse schist or sandstone. Ramon, grin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning like a Cheshire cat, handed me the bronze chisel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As if in a dream I grasped it and chipped with it at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. At the first blow a large flake flew off, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found no difficulty in scoring and cutting the stone even</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the soft metal tool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, amigo mio, do you believe?" exclaimed Ramon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sank weakly upon a bench, mopped my forehead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at the stone as if expecting it to take wings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanish.

And there was no fireworks display.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead, there was a single, rending crash, like that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavy object dropped upon old bottles, and before my</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredulous eyes I actually sazv the great stone shrink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhe and dwindle, until, with the final note of Ramon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument, it remained stationary--the tiny fragment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was now hard stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now, amigo, to prove there is no trickery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all is as I said, will you look carefully at the bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mineral?

As I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to no particular denomination, and have ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">been liberal and broad-minded in religious matters, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that a wedding consecrated by Melik in the temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite as orthodox as any other. It was a really im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posing ceremony, and I fear that--if I tell the truth--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must confess that my mind strayed more than once from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marriage service in its relation to myself and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bride, to dwell upon the fascinating and valuable scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific interests it presented. And somehow it seemed ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceedingly dream-like and unreal, not to say incongruous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me, a staid twentieth-century American scientist, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be standing in an ancient pre-Incan temple before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">image of the sun-god, and listening to the aged priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanting the words of the ancient Hualla marriage cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony, while all about stood the reverent people, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">might well have stepped from the days of the long-for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten past. And as Melik raised his arms and called</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the sun-god to bestow his blessings upon us, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast a glance at the motionless, sphinx-like figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wira Kocha in his niche, the calm, benign face seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile and I could have sworn that the mummy actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">winked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, during all this time, ever since I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Urquin, in fact, I had been constantly making new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most noteworthy discoveries. With Ramon's help</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had invented and made a notebook, using the thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">membranous tissues of a most remarkable animal for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parchment pages, and on this I had recorded brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">accounts of my discoveries. And in this connection I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must not forget to mention, that in Urquin all forms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">both animal and plant life were wholly different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything I had ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am no zoologist and know very little of botany, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hence cannot classify nor adequately and scientifically</seg><seg type="columnLine">describe the strange beasts and plants of the place. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am not at all sure whether all the creatures belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the same order, or whether several orders were repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented; but all were insect-like in appearance, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">many were in some respects like crustaceans. And, as I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that true insects are distinguished in one respect</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the crustaceans by having six legs, I am convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, if they were insects, they were entirely distinct from</seg><seg type="columnLine">any heretofore known. Whether any were forms that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been reduced along with the people, or whether all were</seg><seg type="columnLine">inconceivably minute forms that have always existed, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot say. But the interesting point is that they fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed very closely the habits, characteristics and traits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our fauna. Some were carnivorous, others herbivorous;</seg><seg type="columnLine">some were diurnal, others nocturnal; and while the flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some was edible and extremely palatable and highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">prized, that of others was not considered fit to eat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many were most grotesque in appearance, others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible, others were indescribably beautiful. Particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly was this last attribute true of bird-like creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I can best compare to sphinx-moths, but whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings, instead of being covered with scales or down as</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our moths, were of satiny tissue most brilliantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinted with iridescent or opalescent hues.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was this membrane or skin that was used by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people for their garments, and these creatures, alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the fauna, had been domesticated or at least were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bred in captivity, by the people. There were not, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, any dangerous, venomous nor harmful creatures in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place, and the people were, as Ramon had stated, en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely free from the pests, vermin and noxious insects,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which are such plagues to other inhabitants of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plant life, I think, was entirely confined to moulds</seg><seg type="columnLine">or fungi. Plants were not abundant, and where there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cultivation, the edible varieties were most intensively</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultivated. There were no seeds nor grains as we know</seg><seg type="columnLine">them; the plants propagating their kinds by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spores and spreading roots, and the edible portions con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted of shooots, stems, leaves, and, in some cases, en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larged tuberous root-stalks. Taken all in all, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed to find how closely the life, the customs, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire system of existence followed our own and yet was</seg><seg type="columnLine">totally different. It followed on parallel lines; at every</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn there were analogous details and conditions, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in no case--or at least in very few--were there identical</seg><seg type="columnLine">details. The more I saw of the place and the people, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more I was impressed with the truth of the time-honored</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypothesis that like conditions beget like results and that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter what their environment or their resources,</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings will eventually arrive at nearly the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">results in one place as in another. In fact, I often won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered, if we could but visit the planets, whether we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not find that their inhabitants, while differing in details</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life, wrere after all very similar to ourselves, and if a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, suddenly transported to Mars or Venus, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, in a very short time, adapt himself to conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feel perfectly at home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then I wondered if such a person, regardless of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme interests he might have in his surroundings, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardless of the fact that he might be better off than on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, would not at times long to return to his own people</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his own home. I felt quite certain that he would, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconsciously at first but with ever increasing desire, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found myself longing to return to my original normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">state. Possibly my desire was actuated by the inerad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icable longing that all true scientists posses^ to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">public my discoveries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But whatever the underlying cause--and I must con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fess that I was happy, that I had every comfort and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that any man might reasonably ask--I was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use a trite expression, homesick. And had it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE GREEN PRISM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1075</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been for my wife, whom I literally adored, I should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged Ramon to enlarge me and--though it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been with deep regret--I would have bid farewell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urquin, to him and to Naliche. But the mere thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of losing Mosock Nina was unbearable, and even should</seg><seg type="columnLine">she consent to being enlarged with me, I felt that, away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her friends and family and the surroundings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">life to which she was accustomed, she would be far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy or content. But I soon found, as Ramon had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">truly said, that man never can fathom a woman's mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if that woman is his wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had always been intensely fascinated by my de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scriptions of the outer world, of my former life and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our civilization. She would listen open-eyed and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted lips to my words, and finally she astounded me</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day by begging me to take her with me and return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world I had left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN vain I argued against her mad scheme, although I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear a bit half-heartedly. But nothing I could say</seg><seg type="columnLine">would sway her from her purpose. Her feminine cu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riosity had been aroused, and womanlike, she refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to listen to logic, although I must qualify that statement</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat, for I am convinced, from carefully analyzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife's idiosyncrasies, as well as those of other women</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have met since I have been married, that woman's mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not constructed on logical lines. However* that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside from my story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In vain I pointed out all that Ramon had said in sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port of his refusal to restore all the Urquins to our nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal proportions. I assured her she would be unhappy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">discontented and would long to return to her people. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might as well have talked to the mummy of Wira Kocha</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the temple. Sickness, disease, all the dangers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perils of our everyday life, were so totally unknown and</seg><seg type="columnLine">incomprehensible to her that she did not even grasp their</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning or their importance. As for death--that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing as long as I died too, so we would not be parted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Hamak Pakak, the Urquin's heaven. And the instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">I mentioned being parted from her people she clapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands and danced with delight. It would be won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful to go out of Urquin, to live in my world, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back and tell of all her wonderful adventures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That such a thing would be impossible she refused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe. Ramon and I had managed it. Ramon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone and had returned. So why couldn't we? It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless to declare that there was no manabinite. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to think the crystal could be made by Ramon or</seg><seg type="columnLine">by myself and--sly little woman that she is--she knew, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's intuition, that I had been more or less homesick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and longing to return to my former 5state for some time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she petted and caressed, pouted and pleaded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns, until finally, at my wits' end, I told her I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the decision to her father and to Naliche.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the presence of Melik, Naliche, and of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ramon, I stated the case, not without difficulty, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mosock Nina interrupted constantly. Ramon looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">very thoughtful and sad. Naliche's eyes sparkled, yet I</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively saw no support from her quarter, and old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Melik listened intently, stroking his thin beard, nodding</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head from time to time, and reminding me of a ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erable judge, listening to evidence in a divorce case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramon was the first to speak when I ceased my plea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He used the same arguments he had given me, and added</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had never thought that, after having tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejoin him for over a year, I should be so ready to leave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Poor fellow; he was deeply moved and, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, I rather prayed that the decision of the triumvirate</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be adverse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Melik spoke. "Wisdom, my son/5 he declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">judicially, and almost as if pronouncing sentence upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, "is the gift of the gods. Unto thee the gods have</seg><seg type="columnLine">given wisdom. Unto our prince," (he indicated Ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon) "husband of the divine Queen of Urquin, has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given even more, and I, the high priest of Urquin--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Melik Amautu, was blessed by the gods with rare wisdom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet wisdom, my son, grows and flowers only when it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurtured in good soil and becomes a stalwart tree by</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of growth. Hence, my son, I, who have lived many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times thy years, have more wisdom than thou, my son,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or even than our adored Prince. Yet such is not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case. I have great wisdom of our gods, of our race, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our history, of many things. But my son and our God-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent Prince tells of many things of which they have wis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom and of which I know nothing. My son makes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">symbols that speak unto another. My son knows much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of other people of whom I know not the names. My son</seg><seg type="columnLine">has dwelt in another world, that to me is as unknown as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavens where dwell the gods. And I, though I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer a youth" (I had to smile at the centuries-old.</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest's words "would learn something of my son's wis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom ere I pass to my fathers. I, too, my son, would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">with thee and my daughter into that world beyond."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gasped. It was bad enough to have to stand out</seg><seg type="columnLine">against my wife. But here was the old priest expressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his desire to be transformed to ordinary human size.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My thoughts were interrupted by Naliche, who, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much enthusiasm as Mosock Nina had exhibited, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted that she, too, would accompany us in our proposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformation. Ramon threw up his hands in despair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife fell upon me and almost choked me with hugs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kisses, and old Melik smiled and nodded as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to say it was all arranged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madre de Dios, what can I do?" cried Ramon. "If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should consent to the mad scheme I could never get you</seg><seg type="columnLine">all back here. And even if I could, how could I be sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would not bring diseases or germs or a plague here ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Por Dios, I won't do it. I'll smash every prism in Ur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quin, every fragment of-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His words were silenced by Naliche's lips. But pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently he freed himself, and leaping up, paced back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth excitedly. "And even if I should consent," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed, "what would become of the people here?</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would have no priest, no queen, no-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Prince," I supplied with a laugh, "for of course," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">added, "if Naliche goes you will go also."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And also will go with us the little Mara Choki," put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Naliche.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Santisima Madre!" he cried. "We might just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well transform the whole population and be done with it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A most excellent idea," I assured him. "Provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have enough manabinite to accomplish the feat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, honestly, Ramon, I believe there is no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. Despite the fact that you claim you are per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly happy, I believe you, too, would feel more content</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our old world and in your old form. And----"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a damnable risk," he burst out. "How do I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some terrible tragedy may not happen ? How do we</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that, in the outer world, all the years these people</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lived may not come over them with a rush. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">would you like to see your Mosock Nina transformed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a gray-haired, wrinkled old woman?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">1076</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I laughed.

And you took</seg><seg type="columnLine">as great a risk when you enlarged yourself to come to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You were not at all certain you ever could return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naliche."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But where could these people live?

I ejaculated. "I believe I have the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer to your questions, Ramon. Do you remember I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told you of a remarkable hidden and inaccessible valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stumbled upon in the mountains? Remember, I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that it could be reached only by a hidden way, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a narrow cleft just at the snow line, and which, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a short distance, appeared to be blocked by a cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ract of water melted from the glaciers. And the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance could be held by one man against hundreds if</seg><seg type="columnLine">need be. No one could leave or enter unless it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired, and the valley itself, the crater of an extinct vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cano, is most beautiful. It is warm and sunny; a brawl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing river flows through it, the soil is rich, it teems with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish and game, and there are even wild llamas, the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scendants of those that escaped from captivity ages ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it was at one time inhabited. There are the ruins</seg><seg type="columnLine">of houses, of a temple, of impressive buildings, and many</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such perfect condition that they could be used as</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitations today. It would be, I think, an ideal refuge</seg><seg type="columnLine">for these people. You could reign as their king with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naliche, their queen. They would be as completely cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off from contact with the world as here, and they, you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be far better off and just as safe if not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">safer. And I can guide you to it easily. It's barely four</seg><seg type="columnLine">days' tramp from Manabi."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramon's eyes had brightened as I continued speaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I knew him so well and could so readily interpret</seg><seg type="columnLine">his moods that I knew he, too, had been won over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Por Dios, I had forgotten that!" he cried, springing</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and embracing me. "It's the very spot and--</seg><seg type="columnLine">mil diablos, amigo mio, I must admit it, you were right</seg><seg type="columnLine">about my longing to go back to the outer world. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been worried to death for months fearing some such</seg><seg type="columnLine">calamity as you suggested. At first I did not fully ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciate our minute, our incalculably small size and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever-present dangers that surround us. It has been by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the merest chance that Urquin hasn't been utterly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed with all its people centuries ago.

This was due</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely to old Melik. The old priest astounded us by</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing the fact that he knew of a large mass of mana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">binite but, having always regarded the stuff as evil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as magic, he had never told of it to anyone. But now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was keen on entering an entirely new world and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new life, he lost no time in guiding us to it. The mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of crystal was--in the terms of ordinary measurements--</seg><seg type="columnLine">an infinitesimal bit of dust, hundreds, thousands of times</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller than any visible dust mote. But in comparison</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other fragments we had seen, in comparison to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves, it was enormous, and Ramon felt sure that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would possess sufficient power to transform the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">population at one time. But, as he wisely pointed out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there might be difficulties or even real dangers in at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempting such a wholesale enlarging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The note of the quena might not be powerful enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to actuate the huge prism and it might, for all he or I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, enlarge everyone to gigantic size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moreover, the mechanical difficulties to be met in</seg><seg type="columnLine">transforming the mass to a prism were nearly insur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountable. But, as Ramon pointed out, it would pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vide material enough for prisms for every inhabitant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each, he explained, would be back of his or her indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual prism and--if he were not wholly wrong in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations--a single note would do the trick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This seemed as reasonable as anything in the impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible land, and we at once set to work with a gang of</seg><seg type="columnLine">skilled stone-cutters. In a very short time, we had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire mass of crystal in Ramon's workshop. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting, grinding and polishing of the crystalline prisms</seg><seg type="columnLine">began, and months went by before one-half of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were completed. But eventually all were ready, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ramon devoted the greatest care and many days to set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting up his stands and adjusting devices in the plaza.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were arranged in a circle, spaced with the most ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">act mathematical calculations, precisely the same distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart and from a common centre, where another was</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed. With equal precision and exactitude Ramon</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed small stone tablets on the ground, each the identi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal distance from a prism as its neighbor, and he placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">another the same distance from the central stand. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea, he explained, was to insure the actuating vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory note reaching every prism at the same instant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with exactly the same volume. On each plate or slab</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man, woman or child was to stand. He was to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the central slab and at the properly pitched note on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">quena every prism would--if his calculations were not at</seg><seg type="columnLine">fault--act simultaneously and enlarge every human be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing equally and at the identical instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people, of course, had no idea of what it was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. I imagine they regarded our preparations as</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystical rites, and that some very holy and important</seg><seg type="columnLine">religious ceremony was to be held in the plaza. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when at last the great day arrived, and at Naliche's</seg><seg type="columnLine">commands, backed by those of Melik, the wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">and somewhat timid inhabitants flocked to the plaza and</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE GREEN PRISM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1077</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were arranged upon their respective stone pedestals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they felt certain they were taking part in some new and</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely important ceremony of their religion. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I looked at them, submissive, peaceful, raising no</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions, regarding their priest, their queen and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">alien king with something akin to adoration, and know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing nothing of what was about to take place (or so at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least I hoped) I could not help feeling sorry for them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all well enough for Ramon, myself. Mosock</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nina, Naliche and Melik. We knew what we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing, what to expect, what (provided all went well)</seg><seg type="columnLine">would happen, and we had chosen to be transformed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another state of our own free will. But these poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk had no idea of events to come. They had no say in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter, for of course it would have been hopeless to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have attempted an explanation, and they were, even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconsciously, about to be torn from homes and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">their possessions. Then I noticed that every individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried bundles, a bulky package or two, wrapped in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin, parchment-like material I had employed for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">notebook, and tied with thongs. What, I wondered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did these packages contain? My unspoken question was</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered by Naliche who was now speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE was telling them that she, her husband, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest and the Amautu (Wiseman) with the beard</seg><seg type="columnLine">(myself) had decided it was best for all to go to a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, that there was no danger; and she was asking if all</seg><seg type="columnLine">were there, if all were in readiness for departure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have all obeyed my instructions to have with you food</seg><seg type="columnLine">that may sustain you on the long journey ?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By Jove! she had had more common sense than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us. She had foreseen that the people would need</seg><seg type="columnLine">food, and had given directions for all to provide them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves with enough provisions to last for some time. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what food had they taken? If they had cereals, vegetable</seg><seg type="columnLine">foodstuffs, in their packs, they would find nothing within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrappings when they had gone through the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching transformation. It would never do to over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">look this detail, and breaking in upon Naliche's words, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">voiced my fears to Ramon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry," he assured me. "Naliche saw to that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All they carry is meat. But haw about yourself?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where's your comida (food) amigo?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I--" I stammered, heartily ashamed of my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of foresight. "I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is provided," announced my wife. "My dearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">beloved cannot remember even to eat many times, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy is his mind with other things, and so I have what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shall need on the journey. It is with mine in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of Manakan (our serving man) and Yakussa</seg><seg type="columnLine">(her maid)."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now Melik was speaking, and as I turned towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">him I grinned. The old priest did not intend to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry at any rate. Beside him stood an immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle half as tall as himself and far greater in girth</seg><seg type="columnLine">than his lean body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My children," he said, "fear not, no matter what may</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen. We go upon a strange journey, and the King</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Wise One of the Beard, with their magic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the help of the gods and the stones of green, will</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorten our journey, and strange events may come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. But you need have no fear, for think you that your</seg><seg type="columnLine">divine Queen and your King of great wisdom, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prince, Mara Choki, and my daughter, Mosock Nina,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even I, your priest of the sun, would face dangers if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">such they were? And now prepare yourselves, for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in readiness, and fall upon your knees and give prayers</seg><seg type="columnLine">unto the gods of our fathers. And chant praises unto</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inti and unto Wira Kocha, and unto our divine Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and our King, and unto the Wise One of the Beard, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">great will be the blessings that shall be yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With one accord everyone knelt, and in unison their</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices rose in the joyful chant of praise. Then in silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rose, and though I saw awe and reverence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder upon their faces, nowhere was there a sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear or of doubt. Their faith was sublime, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would follow blindly without thought of question,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherever their adored queen and their revered priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">might lead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I saw Ramon place his bone quena to his lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as expectantly, all waited for the unknown events that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to follow. A few soft low tones came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument, and then a quavering, wailing note that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to tear at one's very heart strings. Higher and</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher it rose, and I realized that it must have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, hypnotic quality, for I felt suddenly drowsy;</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite my efforts to observe what took place, my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, and I felt that delightful but indescribable sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation that we have when on the borderland of slumber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, with the same abrupt jerk with which one awakens</seg><seg type="columnLine">from such a semi-conscious state, I came to my senses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opened my eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced about, and an ejaculation of surprise and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment escaped me. What had gone wrong ? Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisms failed us? There, still gazing with awed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering faces, were the people. There stood Ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon, quena in hand. There was Naliche with the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">prince in her arms, Mosock Nina's hand rested in mine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--I gasped, utterly unable to believe my senses. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great temple, the palace, every building had vanished!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stones on which we had stood had disappeared! On</seg><seg type="columnLine">every side stretched barren sand, broken only by clumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stunted trees and giant cacti. Was it possible?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Had-. Ramon's voice broke the silence. "Well,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">amigo, here we are!" he cried gaily. "Easy as possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not even a jolt or a jar on that trip. And--Por Dios,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what do you see? You look as if you saw a ghost." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned in the direction in which I was staring, as if, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">truly said, I saw a ghost. And little wonder, for as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had glanced at Melik I had seen beside him, not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle I had noticed in Urquin, but the dried, mummi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied body of Wira Kocha!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramon chuckled. "Madre de Dios!" he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's brought along the ancestral god! Well, it's not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad idea. These people will feel far safer and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">content with him to watch over them. I'm surprised old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Melik thought of it. But he's a wise old--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A joyful yelping interrupted his words and into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle trotted the burro with the dog leaping playfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. We had completely forgotten them, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been within range of the manabinite's activity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for here they were, still with us. Then my eyes caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of something else. Sniffing about the sand as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching for food in this unfamiliar land, were two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange, eight-legged, hard-shelled creatures that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been domesticated by the Urquins. And as if the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of the four familiar beasts broke the spell that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them, the people burst into joyous shouts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone began to laugh, talk and chatter at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Santisima Madre, but it's hard to believe we've ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">been away from here," cried Ramon. "Look, amigo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1078</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there's your camp--nothing's changed. I wonder if your</seg><seg type="columnLine">men are still here. If they are and they see this crowd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'll take to their heels or drop dead with terror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No chance of that," I replied. "They've undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">left long ago. You forget I've been away for months.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we might as well stop here and use the camp tonight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's too late to start off for your secret valley now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We can start first thing in the morning, and there's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of being intruded upon here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine, come ahead," cried Ramon joyously, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mosock Nina's hand clasped in mine, accompanied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ramon, Naliche and old Melik, who was followed by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple attendants carefully carrying Wira's mummy, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">led our little host across the stretch of desert towards my</seg><seg type="columnLine">former camp. As I had expected, it was deserted (I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not learn until much later that the men had abandoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a few days after I had disappeared with Ramon).</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I suspected as much when I found that the camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained a large portion of my outfit and a quantity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">provisions. That the scallawags had left anything of</seg><seg type="columnLine">value was due entirely to their inability to carry any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more in their canoes. But the food was most acceptable</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the tools, the supplies, the innumerable utensils and</seg><seg type="columnLine">articles with which I had equipped myself for the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedition and for a stay of unknown duration at the spot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would all be invaluable to Ramon and his people in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">new home. And he was overjoyed to find that the corn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beans, the potatoes and camotes (sweet potatoes),</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all untouched by mice or weevils, and would serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the nucleus for bounteous crops and harvests in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden valley. And I had to laugh at his delighted ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamation, when, in cleaning out the place, he found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the straw used by the men for their beds had heads of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheat and barley in the litter, and that there were grains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cereals still in them. In fact the rubbish proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">a veritable treasure-trove, and for once I was thankful</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the untidy, not to say filthy, habits of the natives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were orange and lemon seeds scattered on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. We picked up a number of durazno (peach) pits.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remains of pineapples, cast carelessly outside, had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">root, and several palta (alligator or avocado pear) seeds</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sprouted. There were a few peanuts also. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a bag of cocoa beans, and a small sack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee beans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gracias a Dios!" exclaimed Ramon. "We can now</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise everything we need in the valley. All we lack is</seg><seg type="columnLine">sugar and cotton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't W'orry over those," I said. "Whoever lived in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley before left plenty of cotton--there are acres</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, and as for sugar, look here." I led him to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the camp, and pointed to a clump of scraggly</seg><seg type="columnLine">cane. "Thank Sam for that," I said. "Like all West</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians, he was forever chewing sugar-cane, and just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an experiment he planted some here. It's pretty poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff, but in good soil it will be as fine as you can wish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now let's get settled down for the night. By Jove!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look at the people, Ramon. What's the matter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them? They're frightened half to death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ever since we had arrived, the people had been timid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">herding close together, gazing about at every object, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course every object was new and strange to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, and even Melik, Naliche and my wife kept close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our sides, awed and half-frightened, amid their strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now abject terror had seized the people. They had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">clustered together in a dense. throng, they were fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaking with dread, and strange sobbing sigh-like wails</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All were gazing with abject fear into the east, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had seen some horrible apparition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as Ramon and I followed their terrified gaze,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we burst into peals of laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were looking at the moon!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to them it was no laughing matter. Even Melik</seg><seg type="columnLine">was frightened half to death, and little wonder. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though there had been night and day in Urquin; light and</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, yet never had the Urquins viewed either the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun or the moon. To them the sun was merely light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was visualized only in the image of the sun-god, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">symbol handed down from the times when their an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cestors had been full-sized men and women. Yet now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in this new, strange land, they saw this great, round,</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous thing rising like a ball of light in the sky. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes it seemed the metal sun-disc of their temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">come suddenly to life, for, seen through the haze above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains, it was golden in color, and the dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows of mountains upon its surface were not unlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">the features graven upon the gold sun in the Urquin</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple. And to see the sun-god suddenly appear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as a moving, apparently living thing, was as ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifying, as awe-inspiring to them as the sudden reincar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation of our God would be to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was with the utmost difficulty that we calmed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fears, and we never would have succeeded if it had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been for Melik who, being a most sensible chap, even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was my father-in-law, quickly grasped the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, with his accustomed ability to take full advantage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the psychological moment, saw, in the rising moon, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity not to be missed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Behold!" he cried in his deep, ringing voice as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his gaunt arms and all eyes turned towards him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Behold, my children, the Goddess, Mama-Quilla, wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our Lord Inti, the Sun. She comes to smile upon you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her people, and to do homage to our sacred Wira Kocha,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose spirit ever guards thee, and whose body is here</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside me. Fall upon your knees, O, my children, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">give prayers to Mama-Quilla, that, throughout this night</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the nights to come, she may ever smile benignly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">thee, while her lord the Sun is at rest, and pray unto her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry thy prayers and thy salutations to her Lord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he may smile brightly upon you on the morrow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on each day until the end of time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramon, who had dropped to his knees beside me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others, nudged me. "Por Dios, I'm afraid your re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spected father-in-law is fixing for a cropper," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered with a grin. "I wonder how he'll square him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self when the moon wanes and doesn't show up some</seg><seg type="columnLine">night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's his lookout," I whispered in reply, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeezed my wife's hand reassuringly. "But you needn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry over him. You'd have to get up mighty early to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get ahead of him, Ramon. In fact you'd have to stay up</seg><seg type="columnLine">all night. He's nobody's fool by a long shot, and instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of taking the cropper you foresee, he'll turn it all to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own account--or rather to the glory of old Wira Kocha</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his faith."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramon chuckled. "I'd give a lot to know what Wira</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself thinks about it," he murmured. "Look at him!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He may be only a mummy, but, por Dios, amigo mio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could swear he winked when he caught my eye!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND THE GREEN PRISM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1079</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finale</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE is not much more to relate. And as I sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, writing these lines with my adorable Mosock</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nina beside me--though in her conventional</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes she is not to my eyes as beautiful as in her scin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tillating robes of insect-wings, I find it hard to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all the events I have written down actually occurred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despite my strange notebook--which by the way con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains only blank pages, for of course the writing, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">in vegetable ink, was not enlarged; despite Mosock Nina;</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite our Urquin costumes carefully packed away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and despite my vivid memories and my wife's confirma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the details, I feel at times as if it were all a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seems incredible that I, that my wife, that Ramon</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been invisible, microscopic beings in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally microscopic land. And it seems almost as in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible that Ramon, Naliche, Melik, Mara-Choki and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others--even the mummy of that unknown ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">Semite, Wira Kocha, are in the hidden secret valley in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ecuadorean Andes. And yet I know it to be so, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know--unless some unforeseen casualty prevents--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, within the next thirty days, my wife and I will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">again among her people; that I shall again be clasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand of Ramon; that I shall again greet Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naliche and old Melik the priest, and that I shall again</seg><seg type="columnLine">look upon the mute, bearded body of Wira-Kocha seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his niche in the restored temple in the hidden valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now green with the tilled fields of maize, wheat, cotton</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cane of the happy, gentle Urquins. Whether we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall remain there and settle down to spend our lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the adopted people of Ramon, I am not sure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But even should we decide to return to our so-called</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization--which I doubt, for I am becoming heartily</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick of it all--we can always return to visit Naliche, Ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon and the others whenever we wish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I am digressing. Early on the morning following</seg><seg type="columnLine">our strange transformation we started on the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey to the secret valley. No human eye saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange procession as it wound across the desert towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distant hills, for in all that land no human being</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwelt. The first part of the way was hard, for it led</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the desert, but the worst of it was over before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun rose high. Then, to rest the people, and out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">consideration for the women and children, we halted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grove of trees during the hottest portion of the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and resumed the journey in the afternoon. Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I forgot to mention the fact, the rising sun caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as much terror and even more awe than had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon the night before. But in a way the people had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared for the appearance of the blazing deity, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were expecting it. And of course everything they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled them with wonder. They had literally entered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new world and it speaks volumes for their courage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their entire faith in their rulers and their priest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they did not become paralyzed or stampede with</seg><seg type="columnLine">abject fear of the unknown, and of the strange objects,</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions and surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we ascended the Andean ranges we were forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceed very slowly, and I, as well as Ramon, began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear that the altitudes would play havoc with the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that, after all, we might be forced to abandon our</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-laid plans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But in this we were mistaken. The Urquins showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no serious effects, even at heights that would affect many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">men accustomed to mountains, and in due time we ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the glistening snow-caps of the peak wherein</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley lay. It was well that Naliche had foreseen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the need of food, and it was still more fortunate that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplies had been augmented by what we found in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, for long before we reached the narrow black cleft</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was the entrance to the valley, we were all on short</seg><seg type="columnLine">rations. But we did not worry. I knew that we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find game within the valley--fish and probably some</seg><seg type="columnLine">edible vegetables that had run wild since the place had</seg><seg type="columnLine">last been inhabited. In this I was not mistaken. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ramon, when he looked upon the great fair valley was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiastic in praise, while Naliche's eyes sparkled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She fairly danced, and all vowed that they had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed there could be a scene so beautiful. Beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river we made our temporary homes, using the ruins of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ancient inhabitants for shelter, and in the vicinity we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found an abundance of half-wild maize, of camotes, peas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beans and other food. The dog chased and captured a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large marmot; several of the men--accustomed to hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant insects of their former home--secured a deer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all dined well. Meanwhile, Melik, in whose mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">religion took precedence over food, had cleaned out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined temple, had installed Wira's mummy within it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as the sun set, he summoned all to render their de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">votions and to give thanks to the gods for the blessings</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had received.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was truly amazed to see how quickly the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">adapted themselves to their new environment. Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few days they were taking everything as a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. They found no difficulty in cultivating the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">crops as well as they had those in Urquin. They fashion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed weapons and hunted the beasts and birds so strange to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They repaired and occupied the prehistoric dwell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings and transformed the ruined palace into a royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">home for Ramon and Naliche, and they worked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">beavers from dawn until dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even to Ramon, who was not yet convinced that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were better off, it was obvious that, under the new* state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of affairs and in the pure mountain air, the people were</seg><seg type="columnLine">livelier, stronger than before, and he was vastly relieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find that the youth of the aged and the--well some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what advanced--years of Naliche and of Mosock Nina,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not altered by their change in life and environment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, in a short time, he was as enthusiastic over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">transference as wras everyone else. But he expressed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear that somehow, sometime, the valley might be dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered and invaded. "There's always the chance of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane seeing us," he declared. "Then how could we</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain free from all the damned troubles and ills of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the world ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's no fear of that," I assured him. "In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first place no plane is coming this way if the pilot can</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid it. It's far too dangerous, flying among these high</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaks. An aviator would have to reach an altitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than twenty thousand feet to cross the surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">summits, and at that height he couldn't distinguish the</seg><seg type="columnLine">details of the valley. And even if, by some miracle, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should see houses and fields here, he'd assume they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins and deserted fields of ancient, long-dead inhabitants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, Ramon, you and your people are as safe here as on</seg><seg type="columnLine">another planet. Rest assured of that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I remained with him and his people for several months,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I had seen them well started and established. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife was as anxious to see the marvels of the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Continued on page 1086)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">               Watch this onej* he said, and directed and elevated the muzzle of his machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1080</seg><seg type="columnLine">ntO the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALLEY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By Alfred Pringle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I LET the receiver fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">back on its hook with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bang and turned in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair.

The denouement of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this vivid story occurs in a star-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tling manner in the inventor's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laboratory in Death Valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Illustrated by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">McKAY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                          got</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-five minutes to wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim laughed. "Another nut. I suppose he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">won the world war if he'd been given a chance.

That was about all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's enough, if he can do that," Jim remarked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to his papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was five years now since I had taken Jim Parsons</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my office as junior partner. During those years, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">business had grown to such an extent that ours was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the best known of the patent attorney offices in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city. I had been somewhat skeptical when I first</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted Jim, for he scarcely had been out of law school</seg><seg type="columnLine">a year and was considered rather wild. He possessed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, a certain shrewdness which, from the first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked him as one who would be successful in the law.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, I soon turned the entire legal end of the business</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to Jim, for I found him capable of handling it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was puzzled about this man, Miller. He had talked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                      very earnestly over the phone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had even gone so far as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer to pay us for our time, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were not interested. Freak</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventors are not usually willing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to back up their ideas with</seg><seg type="columnLine">money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At about five minutes before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time of our appointment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to glance in the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the office door. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow passed across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frosted pane and then in a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment repassed. I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly to the door and swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">it open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stranger was pacing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor, his hands clasped be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind his back and a far-off ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression in his eyes. He stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he saw me.	^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                      "Are you Mr. Harding?" he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am Mr. Miller, the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who phoned you a half hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled, rather foolishly I thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I perceive," he w^ent on, "that you saw me through</seg><seg type="columnLine">your office door. I suppose you have the light in the'</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor arranged for this purpose?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not reply. It was beginning to appear as if Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">was right. If this man was not crazy, he certainly was</seg><seg type="columnLine">most eccentric. However, we could hardly turn him</seg><seg type="columnLine">away without an interview. I decided we had best hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had to say, and then get rid of him in the easiest</seg><seg type="columnLine">way possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is now two o'clock, Mr. Miller," I remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">patronizingly; "If you are ready, we should like to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">about your invention."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will not only hear about it; you will also witness</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very convincing demonstration," he said as he picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a large package which had been lying beside the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and entered the office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1081</seg><seg type="columnLine">1082</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I followed and introduced him to Jim. We drew up</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs, and Miller placed the package on the floor beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as we sat down. In the better light of the office I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a chance to examine him more closely. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large man of perhaps fifty, clean shaven, and dressed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gray business suit. His skin was very dark, and but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his excellent English I would have taken him for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foreigner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are quite sure we shall not be overheard in</seg><seg type="columnLine">here?" he asked glancing suspiciously around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Saturday afternoon and the office force are all</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone," I assured him. "We are alone in this part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My statement seemed to satisfy him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have often thought," he began, as he leaned back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his chair, "that the present method employed in pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jecting a missile is neither the most effective nor the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheapest means available. In throwing a projectile with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunpowder, there are several elements which act upon it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lessen its effectiveness--air resistance and the pull of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity, for instance. There are, however, certain nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ural forces available to mankind which never have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">used, until I centered my attention upon them. Elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity, of course, has been experimented with, but with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out much success. To throw a bolt of electricity, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient power to destroy, was a far more expensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">means than the use of gunpowder. I next turned my</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to other sources. Light was not solid enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had the speed behind it but it lacked the consistence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This I also discarded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My next experiment was with sound. It proved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the very thing I was looking for. Sound does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the speed of light, but there is a certain force be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miller paused to light a cigar. I looked at Jim. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was grinning good-naturedly, and as he caught my</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance, he winked. By this time I was quite convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the inventor was crazy; still, we had to give him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to tell us about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps you have noticed," Miller continued, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a low note is sounded on a pipe organ, it creates a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration in objects close at hand. I worked from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact. Now, sound travels at the rate of one thousand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighty-seven feet a second, a speed about one-half or</seg><seg type="columnLine">even one-third that of a bullet. This speed, however, does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not lessen with distance as does that of the projectile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now then, as the pitch of a tone becomes lower, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations per second lessen. Therefore, as the range is</seg><seg type="columnLine">limited in that direction, I had to work to the other ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treme. My first task then, was to invent a sound pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducer, the note of which would have an enormous num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of vibrations. I have succeeded in constructing such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a machine. Its frequency is so high that it is far above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the range of the human ear. This supplied the necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">force to my sound projectile. Next came the most diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult task of all--the construction of suitable reflectors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps you have noticed that when a stone is tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a pool the ripples thus caused grow fainter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fainter as they spread away from the center. Sound acts</seg><seg type="columnLine">in very much the same way. To overcome this loss by</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading, I built reflectors which would cause the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">to travel only in one straight line or beam. I can vary</seg><seg type="columnLine">the width of this line at will. You, no doubt, see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities of such an invention. I can destroy a path</seg><seg type="columnLine">either as wide or as far as I wish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To control the range, I have built a deflector which</seg><seg type="columnLine">causes the waves to spend themselves, one against an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, at any point I set."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE paused and smiled. The grin had faded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim's face and in its place there was a look of ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehension. The thing had certainly taken a serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspect. I had no doubt that the man w*as mad, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a great deal of logic in what he had said. I hated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think what might happen if such a power as he described</seg><seg type="columnLine">were used for some maniacal purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe," Miller went on, "that I have given you a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly clear idea of what lies behind my visit here. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me give you a practical demonstration."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We gazed silently as he placed the package on a desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and removed the wrapper. The machine he disclosed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our view was as strange a thing as I had ever seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a horn, shaped very much like a megaphone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but squared off at the open end. Directly behind this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was placed a piece of twisted tubing, which resembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a snail shell. A steel box had been set into the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tubing and the whole machine, with the exception of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horn, was enclosed in a glass case. A small shaft ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the steel box through the glass and was connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an electric motor. A control panel was located in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very rear of the machine. With an electric cord the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor connected the motor to a light socket and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">busied himself at the control panel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He worked silently, paying no attention to us. Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned intently forward in his chair, watching the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Presently Miller straightened up, walked over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall, and pressed the light button. The motor began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whir softly. Then he took from his pocket an oblong</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of metal and held it in the palm of his hand for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This," he explained, "is a piece of manganese steel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is one of the toughest metals known to modern sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. There are no tools made which can cut it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You shall see what happens to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He placed the piece of steel on another table directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of the horn shaped muzzle of his weapon. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked around behind his machine and again glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his controls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now!" he cried, and pressed a small lever at the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the panel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced sharply at him as he uttered that cry. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar light burned in his eyes--like the light of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">maniac. It faded at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim stared, fascinated, at the piece of steel. Slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">before our eyes it crumbled until it lay, a disintegrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, upon the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Miller raised the lever and, crossing the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched off the current. His demonstration had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took his seat; "I hope, gentlemen," he smiled, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been able to convince you that there is something</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical behind my invention. Now here is a proposi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion I would like to make to you: In an isolated spot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Death Valley I have erected a laboratory. So far as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am aware, I am the only one who knows of its where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abouts. There I have constructed a machine quite sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilar to this model, but of far greater proportions. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, I assure you, I can destroy the city of Los Angeles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So great is its power. Before we go further into this</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, I should like to take you out there for a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorough examination of my invention. If you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreeable, I shall call for you here, at this building, to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow morning at eight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced inquiringly at Jim. For a moment he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtful. Then he nodded his assent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tomorrow at eight, then," I agreed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">INTO THE VALLEY OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1083</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without another word to us, Mr. Miller wrapped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his model, tucked it under his arm and left the office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as he had gone I went to the table on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay the little pile of steel dust. The fine powder sifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">through my fingers as I picked it up. The surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table was scorched as if fire had touched it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," I inquired, turning to Jim, "what do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's crazy all right," Jim nodded slowly. "But if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has such an invention as he describes, it is not a safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to leave in his hands. What's the matter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning the whole thing over to the police?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Several things." I assured him; "In the first place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they arrest Mr. Miller, I doubt if they could ever make</seg><seg type="columnLine">him disclose the location of his secret laboratory. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">find that place in the innumerable canons and quicksand</seg><seg type="columnLine">traps of Death Valley would be next to impossible. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think our best plan is to accompany him and then fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure out the right thing to do when we get there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next morning, as I approached the office build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, I saw that Jim was there ahead of me. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned cheerfully enough as I came up, but I judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his heavy-lidded eyes that he had slept little better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you rest well last night ?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fairly well," I said, "but I've seen this city lying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins a dozen times in my dreams."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was about the same with me," he admitted. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing is getting on my nerves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I set my bag down alongside of his, for we had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared to stay three or four days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You didn't forget anything?" Jim tapped the bulge</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his hip significantly. For answer I slipped my auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic out of my pocket far enough for him to see it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Promptly at eight o'clock, a touring car drew up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curb. Miller sat in the tonneau, and a Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">chauffeur was behind the wheel. As we got in, I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there were provisions lying on the seat beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inventor was not in as talkative a mood as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the day before. He greeted us briefly. 'Til tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you my plans," he said as we moved off. "I intend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop at some desert town tonight. Then we'll get an</seg><seg type="columnLine">early start tomorrow morning and reach the valley be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore it gets hot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this bit of information he lapsed into a silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which neither Jim nor I could lure him,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was very early the following morning when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">made our approach to Death Valley. We had trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eled all the previous day without incident; and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped for the night, as Mr. Miller had planned, at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert town. We were again on our way the next morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing before the first streak of dawn had shown itself over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ridge of the distant mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As daylight came, the mountains around us loomed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">more distinctly. Far to the east the steely blue Funeral</seg><seg type="columnLine">Range stretched out before us. On the west, and much</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer at hand, lay the Panamints, their sides splashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with reddish tints.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we moved along, I stole a glance ait Miller. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were shining as he peered at the scenes around us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew he loved this valley of Death. He waved a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a northeasterly direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Off there," he explained, "lies the Armogossa bog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is formed by the Armogossa River which loses itself</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sands'of this valley; that is where so many men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earlier days were sucked down in its treacherous</seg><seg type="columnLine">quicksands when they sought a short cut across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley." He chuckled softly as if the thought were pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those white splotches you see," he went on, "are</seg><seg type="columnLine">borax deposits. The valley is very rich in them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then almost abruptly the scenes changed. The road</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had been traveling had carried us quite close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foothills of the Panamint Mountains, and now, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chauffeur swung his car off the road, we traveled straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">into them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The walls of the canon up which we drove rose higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">and higher. Mr. Miller beamed as the picture before us</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfolded. I believe I never before saw the variety of</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors displayed in those rocky walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a point about a mile from the main road the Jap</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly turned his car and entered a narrow gap in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite wall of the canon. This gap in turn widened</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into an arroyo which we followed for another mile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "End of the line," Miller smiled as the car stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We proceed the rest of the way on foot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He packed the provisions into a knapsack, swung it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder, and started up the side of the arroyo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim and I followed with our bags. The Jap remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was hard work to keep up with the figure ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. The going was steep and slippery. With our free</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands we grasped at jutting rocks and bushes to help us</seg><seg type="columnLine">along. Presently we reached the top, where we paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">for breath. I looked back over the trail we had come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the distance I saw the car making its way down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arroyo on its return trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That Jap is a good man," Miller commented. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made this trip a hundred times and never once has</seg><seg type="columnLine">he attempted to follow me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we regained our breath we moved on, pursuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint trail which ran along the rim of the arroyo for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short distance. Then abruptly it swung off across coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try and there followed a series of tortuous climbings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">descents. The sun by this time had risen high and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat was almost unbearable. We moved along in silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then suddenly as we topped a small hill, there lay before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us what can best be described as a huge hole in the earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At one time it must have been the crater of a tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">volcano. At any rate there it lay before us, the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">glinting from the colored rock on the opposite side. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was perhaps three miles wide and five long. The sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">wTere perpendicular except at the point where we stood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the floor was strewn with great boulders. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled and slid to the bottom of the crater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I saw the laboratory. It stood about two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet from us; a roughly-built structure, a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">story high. So cleverly was it sheltered by the overhang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cliffs that it had not been visible to us from the top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we approached the building, I turned to Miller.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How," I asked, "did you ever manage to construct this</seg><seg type="columnLine">building in here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled and shrugged. "It was an absolute neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sity that I should have some place, isolated from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the world, where I could carry on my experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments with this invention. I found this spot and decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use it. I made trip after trip here, bringing in ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terials and supplies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we reached the house he unlocked the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped aside for us to enter. We deposited our bags</seg><seg type="columnLine">1084</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">within, and he stored his provisions in a cupboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was only one room in the place; a wide bench</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been built along one wall and this was strewn with as</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete an assortment of laboratory equipment as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ever seen. A generator driven by a gasoline engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in one corner. A few chairs, a table, and a cot</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed the furnishings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim was gazing curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously around. "Where's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine ?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inventor pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a window to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small outbuilding. "In</seg><seg type="columnLine">there," he said. ' 'After</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have had a bite to eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll visit it and make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few experiments."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was not yet noon but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we ate ravenously of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meal Miller prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us. When the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">was again cleared he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the generator in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner and examined it</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully. Then he started</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gasoline motor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">generator whined above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the put-put of the engine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller turned to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you are ready," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "we will go and try</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the machine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leading the way out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house, he locked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door behind us, an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary precaution, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outbuilding I saw that its</seg><seg type="columnLine">large swinging door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened out upon the rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of the crater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was not particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised at the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">he disclosed to us when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the door. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite similar to the model</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had shown us in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">office, except that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed on a much larger scale; there was the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarly shaped barrel, but the glass case which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosed the rear part of the model was represented by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great steel box. Inside we could hear the whir of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor as it was driven by the generator in the house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The inventor went to the control panel and set his dials.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I saw a crafty look come into his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is a slight adjustment to be made on the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erator," he explained. Til be back in a minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to the house and let himself in. I nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">significantly to Jim. Without a word he moved quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one of the windows and peered in. In a moment he</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He got something from the corner where the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erator is," Jim whispered, "but he made no adjustment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was troubled. It was apparent that Miller had some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">other scheme besides showing us his invention. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was I had no idea but I felt reassuringly of the auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic in my pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miller's peculiar actions had not affected Jim as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had me. He was enjoying himself moving about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine and examining it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Miller reappeared, he did nothing which war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranted my suspicions. Go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to his giant weapon he</seg><seg type="columnLine">again set the dials and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then pointed to a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder about half way</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the crater. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly pressed the lever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With absolutely no noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great stone flew into</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of pieces. Mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler laughed shrilly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "How do you like it ?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, as he swung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine around for an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other aim and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed the lever. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other boulder flew to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch this one," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said and directed and ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vated the muzzle of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far across the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">towered a tall precipice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As we watched it a section</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully two hundred feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">width quivered for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, lunged forward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then plunged to the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the canon with a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous crash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stood there, awed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the irresistible power</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine possessed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller was calmly walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to examine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought. Mute with as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonishment we followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">close behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll notice," he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked, stooping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking up a small piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rock, "How the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations absolutely pulverize anything that comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">within their reach." He pinched the piece and it fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now let us consider the other side," he went on;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"the constructive possibilities in such a device.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It could be used in all sorts of mining and other wrork</seg><seg type="columnLine">where great forces are needed. But I have decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">use it as a destructive measure only." He chuckled</seg><seg type="columnLine">malignantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely," I said in astonishment at what I had seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"there is something which will combat such a power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My ejaculation had been an involuntary one, but if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had suddenly touched off a cannon, the effect would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been more startling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miller wheeled like a panther; more speedily than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought possible for a man of his size. From under his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller wheeled like a panther. ... From under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat he jerked out as strange a weapoyi as the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had just demonstrated, and pointed the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">INTO THE VALLEY OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1085</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">coat he jerked out as strange a weapon as the one he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just demonstrated, and pointed the thing at us. In his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes there was a look of insane rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he wheeled Jim had reached for his automatic;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but too late. Miller had us covered. "So you found</seg><seg type="columnLine">out/' he cackled. "You found out about this other</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon, but you're too late. I'll see to that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was plain to me that I had snapped the string which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had held the man's reason in check, and he was now a</seg><seg type="columnLine">raving maniac.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had no idea as to the power of the weapon with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he was covering us, but we could easily guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his other demonstrations. One barrel was bell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped and made of some white substance. Directly back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the barrel there was a ball of metal three inches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter from which protruded a trigger. A pistol grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed the weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MILLER'S wild laughter continued for several min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes. Then it stopped abruptly, and a rather silly</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression crossed his face. "You two are fools," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leered. "Why should I sell to the United States Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, a machine with which I might capture a nation!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haven't you thought of that? Why should I sell for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few dollars the thing which required a lifetime to plan!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While he spoke, the weapon in his hand wavered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim to me and back again. I stole a glance at my part-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. He was watching the crazed inventor like a h^wk;</seg><seg type="columnLine">only waiting, I knew, for a chance to use his own gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Before I kill you," Miller went on, "I shall demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strate to you the power of my little machine. You shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness a sight such as you have never seen before and</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably," here he grinned, "never shall again. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall see one great force expend itself upon another. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a terrible thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, if you will precede me," he waved us towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the large machine and followed close behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From his pocket he took a ball of twine and fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of it to the lever which discharged the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectile. Then he unwound the twine for a distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hundred yards in front of the weapon. I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">premonition of what was coming, and it sent a shiver</seg><seg type="columnLine">down my spine. Jim was watching Miller closely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You had best stand a little way off," the inventor</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested, as he pulled in the slack of his string. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved hastily. Then Miller swung the weapon in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand from us and pointed it directly at the large ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine. I saw the string become taut. At that instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim went for his gun, but again he was too late. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a deafening explosion and I felt myself sinking into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blackness of oblivion. The next thing I knew Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bending over me, wiping the dust from my face. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment I was able to sit up, and it was then I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived the biggest surprise of my life. We were alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the crater. Miller was gone. The large machine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory which had stood behind it had also dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared. I turned dazedly to Jim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are they ?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seated himself on a stone and lit a cigarette before</seg><seg type="columnLine">answering. "I don't know," he said slowly, as he flipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the match away, "but I have my suspicions. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked cold by that explosion just as you were, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't stay out so long. When I came back to conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, I was dumfounded. But this is the way I've fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured things out: Miller pulled that string and set off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big machine at the same instant he pressed the trigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the little one. Those two engines of destruction sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply annihilated each other. The little weapon blew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and big machine off the map, and the big one re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved Miller. Why those cliffs back of the house didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">come down on us, I can't understand. I'm fairly certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">something went wrong with Miller's plan, and we're the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones who ought to be tickled pink about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you're able to walk, we'd better get started back</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward civilization."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I got to my feet and found I was not hurt as badly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had imagined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must notify the authorities as soon as possible,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I remarked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim smiled. "If you do, you'll be laughed out of town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just try and convince anyone that what we've seen today</seg><seg type="columnLine">really happened. Bring them out to this spot and show</seg><seg type="columnLine">them this hole in the ground. Then try to explain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll probably end up in the psychopathic ward of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was bewildered. "Then in heaven's name what shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">we do ?"

Now, I have made a few calcu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lations from which it appears that such travel could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be arranged in such a way that the strains would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be unendurable and at the same time without</seg><seg type="columnLine">prolonging the time of travel unduly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great difficulty is, of course, in overcoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth's gravitational pull during the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">5,000 miles or so. Since the gravitational pull is</seg><seg type="columnLine">inversely as the square of the distance between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the centers of gravity of the two bodies--in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">case the distance of the space-flyer from the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth--when the machine has reached an</seg><seg type="columnLine">altitude of 5,000 miles the gravitational pull on it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its passengers, is reduced to a rather small</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraction, 2/15th of that at the surface of the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and may be then regarded as a negligible factor--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a normal man weighing about 20 pounds there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, although perhaps gravity and acceleration</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not quite the same thing, yet we can regard</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as the same, since their effects are similar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If we climb at a rate of 32 feet per second from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth's surface, we have an effect which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal to that of earth gravitation in addition to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal weight, so that we should experience a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain equivalent to doubling our weight. Tests,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as common experience in raising men ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically from deep mines, have shown that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human frame can stand this strain without injury.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since the strain is necessarily to be more prolonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">we may find that in a space-flyer we should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reduce this somewhat, but there is no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we could stand being lifted from the earth at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rate of fifteen miles an hour Not, be it noted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an acceleration of that, but a steady climb at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate.

By the end of the second day we should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have reached an altitude of 1,000 miles and by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the end of the fourth day, or at any rate the fifth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">day, we should be at least 5,000 miles from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth's surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Now we may begin to accelerate in the direction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of our course, since earth gravity is negligible from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">now on. An acceleration of 32 feet per sec-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ond per second would give the flyer a change of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">velocity such that we should have the same ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">parent weight as though we were on earth, pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vided we made the end of the flyer nearest the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth our floor. This acceleration of 32 f. p. sec.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">per sec., is equal to gravity on the earth's surface</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so that an acceleration of that amount out in free</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">space would give a similar effect (allowing a lit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tle perhaps for the light gravitational pull of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth and the rest of the solar system). Suppose,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">since we are not entirely free from the earth's in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fluence, or drag, we put our acceleration at 22 ft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">per sec. per sec., which is fifteen miles per hour</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">per second. This at the end of a day (24 hours,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rather, since there is now no day or night) gives</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a speed of about 21,600 miles an hour, or ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">proximately 500,000 miles per day. Keep this ac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">celeration for, say, four days and we have a speed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of 2,000,000 miles per day, and during this four-day</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">period we have traveled some 4,000,000 miles on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our journey. Now hold this speed by cutting off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the power, except for the little required for navi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gation and residual gravitational pulls. In'another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ten days we have gone a further 20,000,000 miles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and are now 24,000,000 miles from home, or about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">half way to either Mars or Venus, should one of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them be in a suitable position. We have been in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all about nineteen days doing this. The second</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">half of our journey will be simply a reversal of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the first half. We shall fall on to the other planet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a constantly decreasing velocity after we have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reached a distance of about 4 or 5 million miles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from its surface, our floor now being the side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">towards this planet. Thus a journey to either</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of these nearest planets, which needs a course of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about fifty million miles if a tangential start and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">finish is to be made, will occupy six or seven weeks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under normal circumstances. If we wish to go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">further, say to Mercury, we shall in this case</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have to begin retarding considerably earlier, since</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the sun's drag will be appreciable in this region,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so that we should expect to take perhaps three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">months on this trip, and to travel at a somewhat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">higher rate of speed. In order to reach the outer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">planets--or rather their moons, since their gravi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tational pull and other conditions are such as to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">make landing on them probably impracticable--we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should need much longer time, and should probably</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">continue to accelerate for eight days to get a speed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of 4,000,000 miles a day. This is perhaps the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fastest practicable speed, since at speeds much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">greater than this relatively to the earth, the Lorenz</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">FitzGerald contraction would become considerable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and perhaps prevent greater speeds with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mechanism possible. At this speed it would be a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">journey of many months to reach these planets or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">satellites, and we should also have to make a big</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">detour away from the plane of the ecliptic in order</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to avoid the Asteroid Belt with its great danger of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">collision with some of the small bodies there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Thus we see that, as far as acceleration and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gravity are concerned, it is quite practicable to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reach other worlds. The difficulty is in designing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a machine which is capable of doing it, but, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all due respect to Dr. Sloane, I believe that some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">day it will be done. Thirty years ago, the wise</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ones of this world scoffed at the idea of man's fly-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing; they regarded Signor Marconi as a madman;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and so on down the list. Let us be more tolerant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and avoid the unwise use of this word "impossible,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so that we shall not have to "eat our words."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I am sure that some wise critic will bring for-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ward the argument that, in order to leave the earth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at all, it is necessary to attain a speed of seven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miles per second. So it is--for a projectile. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are dealing with a machine which provides its own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">power and which can leave the earth at any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speed it desires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I really must apologize for making this letter so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lengthy, but I could not condense it without weak-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ening the arguments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Just go ahead and publish some more interplan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">etary stories, many of them are good, and to me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they are always interesting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                       John L.

Let's assume as "Pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fessor Olsen" (of Red Peril) states, a screen of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> infinite density stops gravity; an electromagnetic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> wave of (?) wave length.

They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are the interior illustrations and the style of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">story titles. I could hardly ask for better cover</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pictures than those on the last three issues of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Amazing Stories. If the illustrations were as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">good as the cover pictures they would be O. K.

To prove this, you state that "the air has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nothing to do with the motion of a rocket and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nothing to do with the recoil of a gun except to act</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as a retarding force." Inasmuch as I am not a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scientist, I hesitate to flatly contradict your state-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment, but I wish to say that rifles and rifle shoot-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing is my hobby and I have thereby learned that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this statement of yours is slightly in error.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The velocity of recoil of a rifle is due to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reaction of the expanding powder gases upon the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">projectile, and upon the air. The primary phase</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">takes place while the projectile is moving through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the barrel; the secondary phase is caused by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">escaping muzzle blast striking the atmosphere and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forcing the rifle backwards. Velocity of recoil, due</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the second phase, has been found, by use of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sebert velocimeter, to be three-tenths of the total</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">velocity of recoil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Proof of this secondary phase can be found in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">use of the Cutt's Compensator; a device attached to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the muzzle of rifles. Instead of allowing the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">escaping muzzle blast to force the gun backward,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the blast is re-directed and forced to actually pull</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the gun forward. Further proof can be found by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cutting off the barrel of the Springfield rifle, or sim-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ilar ones. With the service barrel length of 24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inches, and a charge of 49.5 grains of du Pont</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I. M. R. powder No. 1147, behind the 172-grain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">boattail bullet, the recoil is fairly negligible. Re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tain the same charge and reduce the barrel length</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to 18 or 16 inches, and the recoil becomes very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">severe, although the gun will not develop the same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">muzzle energy as before. As barrel length is re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">duced, the powder gases are still expanding at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">muzzle, instead of having a reduced pressure.

With this object in</seg><seg type="columnLine">view, therefore, I will endeavor to clear up some</seg><seg type="columnLine">incidents in my own humble contributions to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">readers have taken exception.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the "Face of Isis," one or two readers are</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather contemptuous of poor old Prof. Wads-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth's theory that a body deprived of gravitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">would leave the earth at a tangent. I must con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fess to a deliberate hoax on this point, as I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained to the Editor at the time I sent him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manuscript of the story. I hoped--a hope which</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been justified--to set my readers to thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for themselves. The fact is that the worthy Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor was both right and wrong. The following</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the logical explanation:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If it were possible to release a body from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">action of gravity, that body would partake</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the exact movement of the surface of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the point where the body was resting at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of its release. The motion of the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface is a compound of several different move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, i.e., the revolution of the earth upon its</seg><seg type="columnLine">axis, its rotation around the sun, the flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solar system through space, etc. Now, any</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight line element of this compound motion will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not produce any change in the relative positions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth and the gravity-free body. You will re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member that when the travelers in Jules Verne's</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectile threw the dead dog out of the port-hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body continued to travel side by side with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The earth's orbit and the flight of the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system through space approximate (for short</seg><seg type="columnLine">periods of time) so nearly to straight lines that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their effect upon a gravity-free body would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely perceptible. Therefore, a body suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">freed from gravity at the equator would leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth at a speed of about 1000 miles per hour and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would travel in a straight fine* tangent to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's surface. But--and it's a great big BUT</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the observer, standing upon the equator, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">also be traveling at a speed of 1000 miles per hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same direction, almost keeping pace with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gravity-free body, which would, therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear to rise almost vertically above his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The apparent motion would be, at first, extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow and would accelerate rapidly, but this ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celeration is only apparent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inquiring reader may be interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing a diagram to illustrate these conditions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Draw a circle with a radius of 3.82 inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">(3 13/16). Divide the circumference into 24</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal arcs, each of which will be 1 inch and will</seg><seg type="columnLine">represent the movement of the earth in one hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, taking one of these points, draw a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">line tangent to the circle. This represents the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path of the gravity-free body. Mark this line off</seg><seg type="columnLine">in inches, each inch representing the flight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body in one hour. Number the marks on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight line, 1, 2, 3, etc., and also number the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour-marks on the circle similarly, starting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">both cases from the tangent point, calling that</seg><seg type="columnLine">zero. Remember that when the observer is at</seg><seg type="columnLine">points 1, 2, 3, etc., the radius lines through those</seg><seg type="columnLine">points represent "straight up" to the observer. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is now easy to trace the apparent position of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body hour by hour, and it will be seen that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to travel backward, i.e., toward the west.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When a line from a given point on the tangent</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, to the corresponding point on the circle, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">at right angles to the radius, the body will appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to "set" below the western horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In connection with this same story, another</seg><seg type="columnLine">reader raised the point that it is unreasonable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose that an etheric force, like gravity, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be nullified or increased by a chemical reaction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come, come! Leaving out the fact that we do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know anything about the nature of gravity, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is everyday experience that etheric forces are</seg><seg type="columnLine">modified by chemical reactions.

The whole story is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wildly imaginative, of course, and hardly subject</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to logical reasoning, but I think this reader has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">missed the point. It was not the Power Beam</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">itself, but the sudden shutting off of the Beam,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which produced the tremendous strain in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ether, which hurled the boxes into the Fourth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dimension. Hence, Corwin's illustration of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rubber band. The Beam was normally supposed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to be started gradually and built up to full power</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by means of rheostats. Corwin's friend, the en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gineer, turned on the full force of the Beam</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">instantaneously, thus producing the violent counter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strain which brought back the boxes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   All nonsense, of course, but at least logical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                     Cyril G.

And too many times it has an un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">happy ending. What is the need of the inventor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">meeting an unhappy death, etc. ? It is not a neces-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sity for the author of a short story to kill off the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hero and heroine. Many of the short stories you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have published at various times had a happy end-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing. Some of these were very interesting too. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">refer in particular to "The Tide Projectile Trans-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">portation Co." "John Jones' Dollar," and similar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stories. I think that you should be running one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">serial of about three or four issues in length at a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time. In each issue publish a fairly long instal-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment of the serial; two quite long short stories,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that is one-issue stories, such as "Green Splotches,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Around the Universe," "Armaggedon," and "Mi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crocosmic Buccaneers"; then publish one or two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">short stories such as I have mentioned in the first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">part of this paragraph. Then of course the Discus-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sions Department. This might make the magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a little longer than it is now, but I am sure that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">none of your readers would object to this. Prob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ably it would help your circulation to increase</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">too, which would help pay for the additional size</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the magazine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now for the kind of stories to use. For the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long stories I would suggest that you vary the kind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of stories used. First, let us say, run an inter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stellar or interplanetary serial, then for the next</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">use one like the "Moon Pool." Then use one in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">volving the fourth dimension, time, strange races,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or similar types. By all means be sure that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">human interest is present in the story. And don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">let the author be afraid to use his imagination, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">writer of scientifiction has just as much right to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">use poetic license as any other writer, providing,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of course, that he does not violate the laws of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">science too recklessly (I might add that I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not noticed this to any great extent, if at all, in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A. S. so far). Then too, I think that most of us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like a happy ending. After you have suffered with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the hero through a story, if it is a good one, you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feel quite a personal interest in him, and of course</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a happy ending is in order. I myself prefer in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terplanetary and interstellar stories about the best</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of all. For short stories I would suggest humor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ous inventions, such as those of "Hicks," every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">once in a while; Fourth Dimensional, time, rays,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">different forms of life, unexplored places on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth, the atom, and even interstellar stories are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all very good, if well written. Don't be afraid of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">imagination, happy endings, and personal interest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in these either. It is in the short stories that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unhappy ending has reached its peak, it seems that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Another $10 Raise!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why, that's the third increase I've had in a year!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It shows what special training will do for a man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Every mail brings letters from some of the thou-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sands of students of the International Correspondence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Schools, telling of advancements won through spare-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time study.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  How much longer are you going to wait before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taking the step that is bound to bring you more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">money?
