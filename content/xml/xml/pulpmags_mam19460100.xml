He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have passed-ior a romantic adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turer out of the more lurid pages of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiction.

I pointed out to her that, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything, she was my niece by adop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but that actually she was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all to me.

"Kerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pilot; he ought to know. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that after your radio was shot out no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other navigator could have got the plane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back to land. He said that if anybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">else had been navigator everybody in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane would have been killed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ezra Bilkin was a swell guy," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He had a wife and two kids in Indiana.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was my job to bring the ship home</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely and I muffed it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you'd brought it back so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times before," Miriam argued.

"Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore flak shook us like a cork in a storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a Zero planted a bullet an inch from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ear. Suppose the radio was gone?</seg><seg type="columnLine">A schoolboy can take a B-29 home on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beam. I went to pieces. Why do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think they grounded me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T TRSULA reached across the table and</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly gripped my hand. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no need to shout, Alec."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I was shouting again! I was shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all over and the food I had eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bouncing in my stomach. I jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wrist away from Ursula and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched the edge of the table with both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. I'd never before had it as bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">as this. Major Goldfarb, the chief flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">surgeon, told me I'd be fine if I avoided</seg><seg type="columnLine">undue excitement for a while, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if I got these attacks they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to worry about. But Ursula</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Miriam looked at me as if watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">my dying convulsions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shout," I said bitterly, "so I'm a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental case."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nobody ever said--" Miriam started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to protest and then gave it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I pushed back my chair and stood up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went through the swinging door in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the kitchen.

Ursula spoke in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-whisper, but I heard it in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen. "The trip upset him.

I crossed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the kitchen to the door at the other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">end and went up the hall. The doorbell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rang before I reached the foot of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stairs. I opened the front door and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">three men entered. Two of them I knew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--Oliver Spencer, who had been at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">station when I arrived, and George</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Winkler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Years ago Miriam and I decided that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">George Winkler would marry Ursula</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the moment she wanted him. He was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a bear of a man, big and shaggy, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">small bright eyes that crinkled readily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and a broad nose that wrinkled when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he was amused. He was the most promi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nent lawyer in West Amber, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sounded more imposing than it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For a long time now his romance with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ursula had trickled on placidly, with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out change or interruption, if it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a romance. Perhaps Miriam and I were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all wrong and he had dinner at our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">house once a week and was the main-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stay of Ursula's Saturday night poker</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">games only because an aging bachelor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">needed an anchor somewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He greeted me as a father might,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pounding my upper arms with his large</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">open hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I see you were in a hurry to get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back into civilian clothes," Oliver Spen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cer observed.

Sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">Owen Dowie looked like a mild and</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat scared bookkeeper.

The three men went down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hall to the basement door under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">staircase, and for the first time since</seg><seg type="columnLine">my return I was alone with Ursula.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right, let's discuss," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almost she seemed to squirm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SPIDER LILY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's no rush and I can't keep my</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests waiting.

I crossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the house and walked up one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gravel paths through the flower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the middle of July now, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been as mild as this on those two</seg><seg type="columnLine">early May nights when Lily and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked here. We'd had our arms about</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other and now and then we stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kiss. We walked all the way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rickety bench where the grape, arbor</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to be before it fell apart, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat there and necked like two high</seg><seg type="columnLine">school kids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Lily I called her. She was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, tall and slender and all of her so</seg><seg type="columnLine">very white, even her hair which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">platinum, and that night even her skirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blouse were white. The smell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hair was in my nostrils and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth tasted of the perfume that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her lipstick. Her face was small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">elfin, and lovelier in moonlight than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever seen it, and it was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned up to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was what I had wanted to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">home to. Not the Lily who wrote bored</seg><seg type="columnLine">and often nasty letters, when she both-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered to write at all, but the white Lily of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night. My ardent wife with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elfin face and the sweet eager body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had necked on the bench like two</seg><seg type="columnLine">adolescents and then Had gone up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our room. That was our last night to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. There had been two other</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights--the first in a New York hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">after we were married and the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in my room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walking alone in the garden now, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had almost reached the bench. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped dead and turned to look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. That side of it was dark except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for light in the kitchen and in the base-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment cardroom. There were three bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms upstairs--Ursula's and Miriam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mine. Lily, of course, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given my room when I left. It had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">our room for two days and nights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found myself running back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. A minute or two would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">no difference, but I ran and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing hard when I burst into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My room. A man's room. Obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a room in which a woman lived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hadn't guessed earlier that evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I had changed my clothes. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause for so many years it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclusively my room, shared with no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, it hadn't occurred to me that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been different, that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-two months it should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to be a man's room and should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have become a woman's room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                 N</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tore open the closet door.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't live anywhere in this house. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lied to me.

On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the couch in front of the dead fireplace</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bevis Spencer was holding Miriam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.

He was a head taller and had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick unruly mop of hair which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">last forever and he was awkward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">embarrassed with strangers. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened up only a little since our high</seg><seg type="columnLine">school days when he'd been a moody,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsmiling boy who kept more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself. The only reason I had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know him fairly well was that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those days I had a crush on his sister</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen and spent considerable time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spencer house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I begged the Army doctors to pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">me," Bevis was saying, "but they re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused.

Do you mind if I speak to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miriam alone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had been pushing back her hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her brow and readjusting her bun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I said that, her hands paused at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sides of her head, but she didn't look</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bevis glowered at me. Glowering</seg><seg type="columnLine">came easy to those deep-set eyes under</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhanging brows. "I was on my way</seg><seg type="columnLine">downstairs anyway," he said without</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiasm. "They have only four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and I promised to make a fifth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I waited until he was out in the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I turned to Miriam.

I'd be sore too if somebody had</seg><seg type="columnLine">barged in at a time like that. I told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was sorry that I'd come in at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It doesn't matter," he said. "Bevis</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been proposing to me sbout once</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a month during the last year.

I noticed lor the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">since my return that she'd put on</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight. Just about enough weight. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been too skinny since childhood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now her figure was pleasantly mature</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her angular face no longer had that</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinched look. She was a very attractive</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a guy in such a terrific hurry that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was taking ten times as long walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it would to drive. I hadn't even had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense to bring along a flashlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would still save time to go back for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car, but some of them might be out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the house and I couldn't face them</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Not now, anyway. I walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on and came to the fifteenth tee of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">golf course where it angled toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road.

Two years ago she was your</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife for three days and nights and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you were strangers who didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">again see each other.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted her.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't been walking rapidly since I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the bottom of the hill, but all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same I was drawing air into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs with labored gasps. I fumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a cigarette, lighted it, and the smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt good inside me. I walked along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly defined macadam road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T AMES STREET. It wasn't actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">J a street; there weren't any in West</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amber except for the three which com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised the business section. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tar road. Along either side houses were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spotted at varying intervals. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a mile of it, and like a sap I'd left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cardroom without asking just where</seg><seg type="columnLine">on James Street Lily lived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A car approached. I stood in the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of the road and waved in the hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">that whoever was in the car could tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me where to find her. The headlights</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore down on me. The car did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">slacken speed; it seemed determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">run me down. I jumped and felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind of its passing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I cursed the driver for a madman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to be able to curse something, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on.

One of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">should bear her name. I struck matches</seg><seg type="columnLine">•to read the boxes, passing up those in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of houses in which I knew she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be because they were too large</seg><seg type="columnLine">or I knew the people who lived in them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like George Winkler's white brick</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. When I passed it, light went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an upstairs room. That would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amy Winkler, George's spinster sister</seg><seg type="columnLine">who kept house for him. She knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything there was to know in town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She would tell me, but she would also</seg><seg type="columnLine">gush over me in greeting. I kept walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two boxes farther on I came to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The name JOSEPHS was crossed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with black crayon, and under it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">waveringly printed: LILY LINN.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Linn. My name. The name I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to my wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was suddenly very good to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. The fact remained that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed on here in West Amber to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my return. That was all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted. The rest was merely an inabil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity to write letters as passionate as her</seg><seg type="columnLine">embraces. She was waiting for me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was coming to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a neat little stucco bungalow</seg><seg type="columnLine">just off the road. Every window was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted. With both hands I brushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">back my wild hair and ran my handker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief over my face and went up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. I flicked my tongue over my dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips and knocked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no sound in the house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She wouldn't have gone out and left all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights on.

It came out easily. It came</seg><seg type="columnLine">halfway out, and suddenly I jerked my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand away from the knife as if it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned glowing hot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The truth hit me like a kick in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach.

I dared take my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands from my face and the room had</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened out. My head remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent; I was looking down at her legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One foot was covered by a satin mule.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other foot was bare and the mule</seg><seg type="columnLine">which belonged to it lay behind her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She wore no stockings and the nails of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her toes were scarlet. The first time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever seen her without any clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on I had, oddly, noticed first of all her</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted toenails. They had shocked me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little and excited me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was wearing the heavy silk hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tess gown with the tawny-orange tiger</seg><seg type="columnLine">lilies. I had bought it for her the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were married. Lilies for Lily, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. A poor joke, perhaps, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind you delight in on honeymoons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During all the breakfasts I'd had with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, the first in the New York hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and the other two at home, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had worn it.

I didn't want to see any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, but I had to. I raised my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inch and let my eyes move up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumpled form.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The knife protruded from the swell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her left breast. The dull black han-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of a kitchen knife.

The knife had pierced the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her left breast, and it was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">tawny-orange. Her life had dyed it red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  My eyes remained on the bloody lily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wanting to look higher.

I don't mean he wasn't crazy in love</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her besides. As for Lily--well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you heard about her.

I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know why women do certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. Maybe they're bored, home</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. They blame the war and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out on you. It wasn't just Lily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've seen wives and sweethearts do it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to other men. Because you need them</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much and think about them so much,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have a knife in you, and they take</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure in twisting it. Not all women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not many, but more than you'd think.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lily was one--anyway, after the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">year.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Lily wrote, she twisted the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">all she could. Nagging about money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instance. It got so bad that Alec</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into a couple of those big crap</seg><seg type="columnLine">games we have at the club, but crap is</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight gambling and instead of mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing more money for Lily he dropped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of hundred bucks. He was even</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to play poker, but he didn't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has been testified by Mrs. Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessey that Lieutenant Linn is an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptionally skillful poker player.

The way Alec plays</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, it's not gambling. He got into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of small games and then stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It wasn't fun for him.

So you see, Alec had enough on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind without worrying about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife. He was navigating one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge crates over one of the toughest</seg><seg type="columnLine">runs in the world.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">curbs were jammed solid with Saturday</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon shoppers.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">small man was getting out of a car on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gutter side. I almost brushed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my left front fender and stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Dowie," I called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He peered at me through his thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenses.

Dowie stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back against his own car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ahead, the driver of a light truck was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting behind the wheel.

She reclined with a book</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a chaise longue. She wore navy blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorts and a flowered halter. No shoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">or stockings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you hear the news?" she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitedly.

"This last year I went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">several times with Lily on double dates.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't mean that Lily got men for me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except once, but sometimes Lily asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to bring my date along, whoever it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to be that night, and make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foursome."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whom was she with?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Generally Bill Beaty until he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drafted, and twice this spring Emil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schneider after his wife left him."

"You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I'm awful, Alec, going out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">dates like that with your wife, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed harmless. I didn't know till the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial that she was actually having affairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">with those men. And she was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet to me.

The question was to my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and the answer too complicated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helen said: "I admired her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to be like her. I mean so beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tifully turned out and sophisticated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't mean the other thing -- with</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. After what happened at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadhouse on the Fourth of July I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came disgusted with her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"JT WAS the way I told it at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial. I didn't keep any of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">back; I wanted to help you. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first and only date I let Lily get for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Her ex-husbard, Don, drove up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from New York w:!th a man named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walter, and Lily asked me as a favor</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come along for Walter. I didn't like</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at all. He had a long face that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as blank as a wall aid small eyes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no expression except when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at me and then they seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be undressing me. But I must say this</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him--he never tried to make a pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me. Well, you heard at the trial</seg><seg type="columnLine">how Lily got very drunk and let Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">paw her right in public and what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said about you. Then Bevis and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miriam came in for beer and dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they saw what was going on at</seg><seg type="columnLine">our table and they took me home. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was glad to go, I can tell you. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can imagine the battle in our two</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses that night.

About a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour in I took the north prong of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fork and kept the pedal down. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch, when it hit the shore, was pret-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty desolate since the hurricane cleaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out most of the summer shacks, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a little joint out there, hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger than a dog wagon, that used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get quite a play from the sea food lov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers.

I cleaned a peep-hole on the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow and peered in. There was a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dust, but there was a tiny bar with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some plates on it and a half empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH MYSTERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whiskey bottle, and on the shelf behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in front of the mirror was another</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle of whiskey, a small keg and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone. In the left corner was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">juke box. It looked screwy, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew I was right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The seventeen nickels," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned away from the window and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started trotting down the road that led</seg><seg type="columnLine">to what used to be a fishing village.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fishermen's shacks had gone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind, and the big weighing-in house</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all that was left. For a road to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted village, this one had a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire marks, and a lot of them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy trucks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man was doing his best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep up with me, but I was running</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty hard, because I wanted to get it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the body hadn't been there I ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually would have been disappointed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was, lying on its face close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, and beyond it in the dry sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something that looked like a dog,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched out and sleeping. I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corpse over. He had taken one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the six shots through the hand, as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had put his arm up to protect himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other five were in the face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest, and it wasn' a picture I'd want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry around in a locket. I heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stifled gasp behind me and looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the old man's ashy face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's Dennis," he moaned. His chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked a couple of times.

I had mine out by this time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent a few quick ones at the rim of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunes that must have sounded danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous, for after a few minutes I heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">car roaring away but fast. By the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had floundered to the top of the dunes</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing there but a road that</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved out of sight almost immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the scrub pine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ran back to the old man.

The barrage that</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed came from the two dicks at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window, and they tore him to pieces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for there was a hell of a lot of blood--</seg><seg type="columnLine">all he had, it looked. But the madhouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't stop there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shots started her off again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was one shriek after another from</seg><seg type="columnLine">upstairs, then a scramble on the stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she came charging into the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still stark naked, her eyes rolled up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head, her hair flying. She must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been as blind as a bat, for she ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">smack into the wall and knocked her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self out. One of the dicks gladly helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nurse roll her up in a blanket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry her out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to the old man and said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, there's your five grand worth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But tell me' something.

It was stiflingly hot in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">studio, and Reece had already taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">three shots of the girl, rearranging the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights and setting each time in the ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort to be certain that he got one picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would be exactly right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leila Nesbitt held the pose, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an evidence of strain, fortunately</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealed by the shadows, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that she had still to gain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">statue-like immobility necessary in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">professional photographer's model.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reece hesitated a moment in the act</seg><seg type="columnLine">of squeezing the shutter release bulb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at her. He felt the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of aching tightness well up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat. He'd taken pictures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scores of beautiful women, but be</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't recall having felt this way be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. This was the first time any girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever been more than a common</seg><seg type="columnLine">object of photographic composition, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere problem in lights and shadows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was afraid. Afraid because what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt was so new and rare he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not bear the thought of disappointment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece swallowed hard and pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulb. "That's all" he told Leila,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The girl slipped at once into the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parative darkness to one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly floodlighted bathroom scene and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began quickly to pull on a more sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantial robe.

Photographer's models usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">become quite unconcerned and base af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter a time about displaying their physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal charms, and in this respect Reece</seg><seg type="columnLine">found Leila different. She was a new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comer to the modelling game. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">met her a little over a month before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short time after she had arrived in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, looking for work. Fascinated at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once by the novelty of her reserve,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reece had hired her. And all too soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had found himself thinking in terms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wedding rings and apartments for</seg><seg type="columnLine">two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think the pictures will turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">out all right, Floyd?" Leila asked anxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously as Reece turned off the flood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights. She was barefooted, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost child-like in the long green robe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her chestnut hair, the hue of polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">mahogany, had been piled atop her</seg><seg type="columnLine">small head for the picture, and now she</seg><seg type="columnLine">began deftly to rearrange it, searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reece's face questioningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece flashed her a grin of reassur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance. "Don't worry, Leila.

Could</seg><seg type="columnLine">it be that she was interested in him?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reece went cold at the thought. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not considered Kendall as a rival,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now the possibility came to him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with the shock of an electric current.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said slowly, "The pictures are</seg><seg type="columnLine">important to me, too, Leila.

We're</seg><seg type="columnLine">both in the same boat. Naturally, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping the pictures turn out well. Get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting that contract from the Dahlia Cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metic Company would establish us</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the big firms and bring in more</seg><seg type="columnLine">business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leila smiled ruefully. "You look too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much like an artist, Floyd. I keep for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting that you're a businessman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unintentionally, the girl had touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reece in a sensitive spot. To hide the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden bitterness which twisted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, he turned quickly to a nearby ta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble and picked up the photographic</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates which he had just exposed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">resented his appearance--a resentment</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had grown entirely out of his as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sociation with Kendall. Short and thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a sedentary pallor, Reece was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all too aware that he cut a poor figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside Kendall, who was tall and ath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">letic. He did not like to have the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trast referred to, no matter how indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly, and coming from Leila, the hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">was especially keen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you going to develop the pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures yourself, Floyd?" Leila asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicating the plates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forcing an expression of calmness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reece nodded. "Thii is a rush job, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with everything depending on the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults. I wouldn't care to trust any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the assistants with them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to get dressed, then," Leila</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. She smiled at Reece and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the dressing room adjoining the</seg><seg type="columnLine">studio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, just a minute, Leila!" Reece</seg><seg type="columnLine">called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes?" She turned back to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLOSE TO MY HEART</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">81</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">questioningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ...

Mr. Kendall has</seg><seg type="columnLine">already asked me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece had an abruptly sick feeling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jerry? You . . . you're going out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Jerry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leila stared at Reece wonderingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As though frightened by what she saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his face, she turned quickly away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some seconds, Reece stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though in a daze. Finally he roused</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself into motion, started leadenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the darkroom. He walked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though through the shards of broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes. He knew that there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer any hope for him, if Jerry Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dall were interested in Leila. His envy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Kendall suddenly became cold re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lentless hatred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the darkroom, going mechanically</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the process of developing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates, Reece found himself toying with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the though of murder. If Kendall were</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the way, he would have a clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">field where Leila was concerned. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agency would belong to him en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely. Kendall had organized and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced it to the point where Reece felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could easily carry on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the stumbling block in Kendall's</seg><seg type="columnLine">elimination was how to do it safely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reece knew he had to avoid suspicion</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only from the [&gt;olice, but from Leila</seg><seg type="columnLine">also. Especially from Leila, since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl had already guessed his feelings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With vengeful determination, Reece be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to ponder ways and means.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JERRY KENDALL was in his office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to Leila, when Reece en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered with the finished prints. Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dall rose eagerly to his feet. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the pictures turn out, £loyd?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reece had already decided on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude he would assume for the dura-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of his relations with Kendall -</seg><seg type="columnLine">relations to be terminated as soon as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool-proof plan for murder presented</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself. He would be completely friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and ingratiating, as though nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all were going to happen. Now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned with an expression of exag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerated boasting and waved a hand of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the thumb and forefinger formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circle, the remaining three fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffly erect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kendall seized the pictures impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiently and spread them out on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk. He and Leila scrutinized them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with exclamations of delight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're great!" Kendall said. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">did a swell job, Floyd. As soon as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">copy is ready, we'll ship the layout to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dahlia Cosmetics people. The pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures alone are sure to win us the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tract."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sliding the pictures together, Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dall placed them carefully in his desk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This calls for a celebration. Get your</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat on, Floyd, and we'll all go down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs for a few drinks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right with you!" Reece assented</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly. He was relieved to see Leila's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face clear up at his ready acceptance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invitation. He knew she had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed as unimportant his chagrin ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lier at the news that she was going out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Kendall. Soon she would forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it entirely. Thus when Kendall</seg><seg type="columnLine">died, she would have no reason to sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect Reece.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slipping into his coat, Reece rejoined</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leila and Kendall, and together they</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode the elevator down to the combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion restaurant and cocktail lounge on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main floor of the building. Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dall's elation at the certainty of the '</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal with the cosmetic company filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with small-boy mischief. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed at Reece teasingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look at that coat, Leila. Have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen anything like it?

"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage to pick up a few things here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Every little bit helps, business</seg><seg type="columnLine">being the way it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kendall and Leila laughed apprecia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively. Leila said, sobering:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've often noticed the way your</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets bulge, Floyd. Just what do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry in them anyway?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Photographic equipment, mostly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A miniature camera, spare film, photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meters, reference books, and things like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. Good pictures are all around you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it pays to be prepared."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kendall slapped Reece's back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's the proper attitude, Floyd. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">going around in a coat with so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious bulges, I should think you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">scare the pictures away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece choked back his anger, keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the smile fixed rigidly on his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was painfully aware that Kendall</seg><seg type="columnLine">was making him look like a fool--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of Leila. His determination to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill Kendall became a thing of burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the cocktail lounge, they found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">table and ordered drinks. Kendall ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uberantly proposed a toast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's to Dahlia Cosmetics. May</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lipstick never smear and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mascara never run!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rJ''HEY laughed and drank. Kendall</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to discuss plans for expan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of the agency as if the Dahlia Cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metic contract was a foregone conclu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. Reece forced a pretense of inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est, fuming as he noticed how Leila</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung on Kendall's every word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece was pleased when Dominick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo appeared beside the table. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of the moody Italian art</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dealer would serve excellently to divert</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leila's attention from Kendall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, my friends, how are you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo greeted effusively. He seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had a few drinks too many. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">always, his expensively tailored suit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrinkled and mussed. His great shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of curly black hair, streaked with white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on end as though from repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous combing with his fingers. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sad liquid eyes and a long melan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">choly face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece knew Vallo quite well, as did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kendall also, since Vallo's art gallery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and curio shop was on the same floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the agency offices. Leila had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">met him, having been introduced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reece a few weeks before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Reece's gesture of invitation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo pulled up a chair and sat down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He proceeded at once to fix Leila with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a devouring gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madonna!" he exclaimed at last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It cannot be, but my eyes, they do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie.

"Just what is this certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">miniature you're always talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vallo leaned toward her confidingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but watching him, Reece thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">detected in the other's attitude a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">hint of contradiction. Vallo's eyes, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some reason, seemed to become lidded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded, as though he were hiding as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as what he intended to reveal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The miniature is a little painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">portrait, just so big." Vallo held out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb and a forefinger, separated by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of some two inches. "It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in Venice around the time of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Borgia's. It is old, very old, and valu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. But most important, Signorina,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of the girl in the miniature is</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost the same as your own!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vallo leaned forward still further, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLOSE TO MY HEART</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the amusement of Reece and Kendall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the dismay of Leila. "Ah, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must see this miniature, Signorina. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will show you other things. Famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">paintings--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kendall chuckled. "Come up and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">my etchings, said the spider to the fly."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo drew back with an injured ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression. "What!

Vallo promptly forgot his</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor as a bar hostess appeared with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tray of drinks. He buried his long</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose in a glass eagerly. When he fi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nally set it down, his mournful expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion had returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, no, the Vallo's have long been</seg><seg type="columnLine">known as men of integrity and virtue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little Signorina would be quite safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my hands. W'hy . . . why, gladly</seg><seg type="columnLine">would I lay down my life to protect</seg><seg type="columnLine">her! There is nothing I would not do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She has only to say the word, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would gladly end my life." Vallo</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumped the table and looked at Leila</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a kind of mournful determination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't believe him," Kendall told •</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl. "Dominick tells that to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ladies. In fact, he has quite a repu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation around here as a potential sui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cide. The only reason why he isn't dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">already is because he always passes out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from too much bottJed courage before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he can commit the bloody deed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, but this time it is different,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo insisted. He seemed determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Leila should not take his threat</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly. "This time I mean it. Long I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been in love with the girl in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miniature. And now to find her in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh, alive . . . Vallo released a</seg><seg type="columnLine">doleful sigh. "Ah, if I were only young</seg><seg type="columnLine">again; But, Signorina, perhaps you do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not mind?" Vallo asked, leaning sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly toward Leila again. "Meglio</seg><seg type="columnLine">tardi che mai. Better late than never,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She drew back, startled, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. "I think you're very nice, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo. But if you don't mind, I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather have a boy friend my age."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo shook his head bitterly. "So it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be il campo santo--the cemetery</seg><seg type="columnLine">--after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kendall glanced at his watch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up. "We'd better be going, Leila,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we're to have enough time to climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">into our formals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded quickly and picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">her purse and gloves. Reece seethed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her evident eagerness. He managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an airy wave of the hand as she and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kendall left. Reece was almost glad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have them go. If they had remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">another minute, he felt as though he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have burst with the volcanic fury in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece remained for a while at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table with Vallo. The mournful-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">art dealer kept exclaiming at intervals</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the marvel of Leila's resemblance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lady in the miniature. Reece</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only dimly aware of what Vallo</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sayfhg. He was grappling once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more with the problem of his intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder of Kendall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A WEEK passed. The Dahlia Cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metic Company approved of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures and layout, and the contract</seg><seg type="columnLine">was duly signed. Reece found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly overwhelmed with an influx</seg><seg type="columnLine">of new business. He saw little or noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of Leila, but from occasional re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks dropped by Kendall, he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kendall was seeing the girl fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently--all too frequently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece's problem was still unsolved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No safe plan for murder had yet sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested itself. And with the element of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time now introduced by the growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">intimacy between Kendall and Leila,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole thing was beginning to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During a lull in his work, one after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH MYSTERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">noon, Reece seized the opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit the cocktail lounge on the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of the building. He had, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">became of late a steady customer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dominick Vallo was seated at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tables, staring moodily into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths of an old fashioned.

Vallo</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece shook his head.

"Marry!" he gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vallo nodded solemnly. "Jerry was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a great hurry, but he told me this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just a few minutes ago.

Ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruptly he stood up. "I don't want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him. Come on, let's go. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">another bar around the corner." Reece</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed a bill on the table to pay for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinks, as yet unarrived, and grasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reluctant Vallo by the arm, hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">left</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the other taproom, Reece and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo settled down to serious drinking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The alcohol was a key that unlocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of Reece's reserve. He began</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring out to Vallo the story of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes and frustrations. Highly emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional by nature, Vallo's usual melan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">choly deepened to a boundless sympa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thy for Reece.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That Jerry Kendall, he is a rat!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo declared thickly. He hunched</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Reece secretively. "My friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you need in this crisis is one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little toys the Italians like the Bor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gia's used long ao.

Not your</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, my friend, but the heart of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. For inside the miniature is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">device which throws out a poisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle when the heat of the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">melts a little wax stop. A nice gift,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no? Your enemy wears it close to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, and--phf-j-t!. No more enemy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something clicked in Reece's mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the pieces of a long, perplexing puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zle falling finally together. A ray of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning penetrated the alchoholic fog</seg><seg type="columnLine">which filled him. He told Vallo, "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible. I don't believe a word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Such a thing just can't be done."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo's back became stiffly perpen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicular. "Impossible, eh? Well, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">show you the miniature! You shall see</seg><seg type="columnLine">for yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, but you're going to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hard time convincing me." Reece rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">in belligerent acceptance of the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenge. This w.is exactly what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been hoping for. Vallo had played</seg><seg type="columnLine">right into his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fog inside Reece was swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">evaporating. He glanced at his watch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was almost evening, which meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">that most of the tenants of Reece's and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo's office building would be gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This suited Reece fine, since it meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was now little chance of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">running into Kendall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">£^NLY one elevator operator was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">on duty in the building and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cage was rising to the upper floors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fuming at Reece's irritating disbelief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo plunged up the stairs. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrug, Reece followed. They met no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLOSE TO MY HEART</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">body on the way to their floor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall itself was empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Muttering hotly under his breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo fumblingly fitted his key in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock and led the way into his shop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From a drawer of the old-fashioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll-top desk in his office, he pulled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small flat metal box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here it is!" he announced trium-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phantly. "Now I shall show you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo opened the box and into the palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his hand shook a tiny framed paint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing which looked curiously thick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Handle it carefully," he warned as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reece impulsively reached for it. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">last owner of the miniature kept poison</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the needle, and it is still deadly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece gazed at the miniature with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinated interest. The painting was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a young girl. The resemblance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leila seemed slight at first, but strange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly the longer Reece looked at the paint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the closer the similarity became.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He realized finally that the alikeness</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due more to spiritual than physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">characteristics. The girl in the minia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture had the same quality of demure</seg><seg type="columnLine">shyness as Leila.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But where is the needle?" Reece</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Vallo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is inside," the other explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pointed to a barely discernible spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the surface of the painting. "See?</seg><seg type="columnLine">She wears a red dress. This is red wax,</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering the hole where the needle</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes out. It is hard to tell the differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. no?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece nodded slowly, his thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurrying like hungry mice. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't know it was there unless you</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked for it." Reece abrtiptly grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo's arm, and his eyes narrowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen, Dominick, you agreed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kendall played us a dirty trick by tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Leila away from us like that. Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">we going to let him get away with it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">No we won't! I'll tell you what we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. We'll send him the miniature for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a wedding present--tell him to wear it</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to his heart. There's our revenge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dominick. How's that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madonna, no!" Vallo snatched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miniature from Reece's hand. "The lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle Leila, she knows. She will tell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police who sent the miniature. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to jail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right, of course," Reece</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered. He bit his lip, frowning</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully. In his mind, the complet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed puzzle shifted, rearranged itself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clicked into place. Exultation coursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through him like the glow of vintage</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine. His plans had changed a little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now they were perfect--utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolproof. He was goi.ig to murder Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dall--and get away with it beyond any</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest suspicion from either Leila</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the police.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece had earlier noticed a brace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">antique duelling pistols on the wall over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo's desk. Now he pointed to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretending a sudden interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, Dominick, do those old guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">work?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Work? Certainly! They are gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uine, these, and not just for show."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo placed the miniature on his desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took down one of the pistols.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece drew back in mock alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Careful with that thing, Dominick!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't worry, it is not loaded."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But can you load it, Dominick?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure. I have powder and shot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case that goes with the pistols. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the method."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's load it, then," Reese suggest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed in sudden eagerness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vallo shook his head dubiously. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is too much trouble."	.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, Dominick, we'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some fun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, it would be just a waste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece gauged the other's state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">inebriety carefully. He decided to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ruse which had worked successfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">once before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH MYSTERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't believe that gun will work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dominick. You're just trying to im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    BEFORE, Vallo bit. His dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes lighted with indignation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Again you refuse to believe," he ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cused. "All right, all right, I shall load</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. You shall see for yourself." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down at the desk, removing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the drawers a large leather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered case. It was lined with red</seg><seg type="columnLine">velvet inside. There were depressions</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the pistols, and compartments</seg><seg type="columnLine">which held powder, shot, and wadding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With quick though unsteady hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo loaded the weapon. When he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished, Vallo extended the pistol with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flourish to Reece.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There! Now it is loaded." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">carelessly indicated an old leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">couch across the room which was cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with pillows. "Go ahead, prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for me. I have loaded the gun so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there will not be much noise."</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a smile of anticipated triumph,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo produced a half-filled bottle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiskey from the desk and drank deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. Putting the bottle down, he swiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eled in his chair to watch the couch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece's lips thinned in a hard grin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He placed the muzzle of the pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Vallo's right temple, and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">th' other could realize what was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to happen, he pulled the trigger. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a dull muffled roar. Vallo slumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">limply in the chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece felt as though on fire with ela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. The set-up was beautiful--just</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful. In his mind's eye, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">visualize just the way it would look to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police, to everyone. Grief-stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the news that Leila was going to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">married, Vallo had committed suicide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The art dealer's brooding melancholy</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperament, and the numerous threats</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had made to kill himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">would support the theory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, however, was just a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reece's plan. He chuckled with satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction as he rounded out the rest of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forging Vallo's hand-writing, he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to send the miniature to Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dall, with the explanation that it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wedding present, and the sentimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">request that Kendall wear it close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart. The job of forgery need not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done with exactness, since any no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticeable differences would be explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the basis that the writing had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">done while Vallo was drunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since the miniature bore a resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blance to Leila, Kendall would carry it</seg><seg type="columnLine">around as a keepsake. The needle</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do its lethal work--and Reece</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have a clear road both with Lei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">la and the agency, with nobody the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiser. Kendall's death would be ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted as due to an act of revenge on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the part of Vallo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reece got to work. Wiping the pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean of his fingerprints he placed it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo's hand. Then he assembled all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the necessary materials--pen, ink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twine, writing and wrapping paper, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">various records from which to copy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vallo's handwriting. He first wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the miniature carefully and addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to Kendall. That done, he wrote a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short note, explaining the miniature as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wedding gift and adding the request</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Kendall wear it close to his heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With stamps he found in one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk drawers, Reece finally had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">package and note ready for mailing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He departed by way of the stairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the lobby of the building only</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he was sure he would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed.

Reece signed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly and dashed for the bus stop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His coat pockets were filled as usual.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a futile search for space, Reece</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuffed the envelope into the pocket of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the agency, Reece found matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeding as though nothing had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. The Vallo part of his plan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone through without complications,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had learned from a garrulous ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vator operator.

We get acquainted with Mug</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milligan out at that rehabilitation cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter in Arizona. That was no accident.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The head doc rigged it up because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was worried about Mug Milligan.

All you got is a bum leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">from shell fragments, and all I got is</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheezy lungs from a chest wound. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're not depressed, even if we don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no homes to go back to, and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">very good prospects of being able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle our pre-war jobs. Now do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin to get it? That's psychology."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yeah. Okay," says Herbie, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard.

I opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door to the hallway, but there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in sight. The door to the fire stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">is just a few feet away and I got to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fast as I could.

This fellow was sneaking up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs with his gun drawn.

A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who can hand out that "line," for which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaker sex is so gullible, is almost always dub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed a "casanova" by his friends. What our</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern world is apt to forget is the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name of Casanova belonged to an eighteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">century adventurer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That Giacomo Casanova was regarded as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminal in his own times is often forgotten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In July, 1755, he was sentenced to five years</seg><seg type="columnLine">imprisonment by the Inquisitors of Venice. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">October, 1756, be led in one of the most spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacular escapes of all time. In several atheistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">poems he had composed, Casanova offended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">church and was soon placed under their watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful eye. While in Venice, the Inquisitors--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">judicial instrument of the church--took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pains to employ Manuzzi, one of their best spies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an effort to find the evidence to put Casanova</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a dungeon. When his room was searched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">copies of banned literature were found; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly arrested and sentenced to a long term</seg><seg type="columnLine">in prison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Casanova's cell was a tiny garret with a ceil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing so low that he could hardly stand. In order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to walk about he was forced tv- bend his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shoulders. Since his room was just under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof, the summer heat was almost unbear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. Once a day, the goaler, Lorenzo, came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit him. He brought food and any other slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">convenience Casanova could pay for. Once in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Lorenzo took him to a neighboring cell</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he could exercise by walking in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">upright position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first Casanova was resignet! to this dismal</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate. Inwardly he believed that he could never</seg><seg type="columnLine">live through his term of imprisonment. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">degrees his attitude changed to one of a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">optimistic nature. And when, during one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">exercise periods his eyes lit upon a heavy iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolt which had been cast into a corner, he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that an escape might be arranged. Discreetly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hid the bolt in his dressing gown and carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">it back to his cell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This heavy piece of metal was to play a dual</seg><seg type="columnLine">role in the escape of the imprisoned Casanova;</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharpened it could serve as a chisel, a means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of chipping his way to freedom--and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">also be invaluable as a weapon to protect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">life of ks daring owner from unforeseen dangers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For eight long days lie worked in secret to rub</seg><seg type="columnLine">it down to the desired sharpness. Finally a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point was fashioned at one end. Eight long</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyramidal facets were made, and the bok was</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformed into an octagonal dagger. The task</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a difficult one, for Casanova was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to any form of physical labor. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, he had no oil with which to cover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small piece of marble which served as a rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing stone; without oil he could not render it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with satisfactory abrasive powers. Instead he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to spit on the stone to moisten it. His right</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm became so stiff he could hardly move it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the palm of his hand was an open wound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These pains were worth enduring because, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long struggle, he had a shining finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as it was completed, Casanova hid</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dagger from the prying eyes of his keepers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cautiously he placed the weapon in the stuffing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the back of his armchair--and then he waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently for the opportunity to put it into use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every day of his imprisonment, Casanova had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new set of grumblings with which he plagued</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lorenzo. The filth he was surrounded with, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust and the heat of his cell, the poor quality</seg><seg type="columnLine">of food, the small amount of light, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of books to help pass the time were just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few of the complaint* he uttered daily. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casanova's scheme for escape began to form in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind, he realized how wrong he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">to complain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room directly below his own served as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. It was cleaned every morning. Casanova's</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan consisted of milking a bole through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of his room. Through this aperture be</seg><seg type="columnLine">would let himself down with the aid of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheets from his bed. There he would wait until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door was unlocked to facilitate the cleaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">CASANOVA'S PRISON BREAK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room. Somehow, he would make his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out through the building to Ircedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This plan was complicated by the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the digging of the hole would require time. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">work had to be concealed from the watchful</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye of Lorenzo. The floor space under the bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered the best solution, but Casanova had</seg><seg type="columnLine">previously complained of fleas, and now Lorenzo</seg><seg type="columnLine">supervised the thorough daily sweeping of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Pretending that he had a violent cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the dust of sweeping made him cough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought results. However, Lorenzo grew sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picious after a few days, and every corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room was swept out. By pricking his finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and staining a handkerchief with blood, Casa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nova was able to convince Lorenzo that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not told a lie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The winter nights were conveniently long, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casanova took full advantage of them. The hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his bed grew larger and larger. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times during that winter Casanova was forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to share his cell with another prisoner; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work had to be abandoned until he was alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">once again. Two days before he planned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make his exit to freedom, Lorenzo came to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the joyful news that he was to be trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to a more comfortable cell, a room with</seg><seg type="columnLine">two large windows through which he could look</seg><seg type="columnLine">over half of Venice. The goaler was surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to notice Casanova's reluctance to move. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">reality the poor man almost fainted with terror;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was certain his hole would be discovered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trying to hide his true feelings, he quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed cells. After an hour had elapsed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lorenzo barged into his new cell and threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to report him for attempting to escape. Casanova</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked that if this was done, he would report</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lorenzo for having given him the tool. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">goaler chose to remain silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before long Casanova began to plot his escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more. It was not so easy this time because</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lorenzo was more careful. Daily the walls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">floors of his cell were tapped in a search for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the existence of new holes. Soon, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lorenzo relaxed the n-le to the extent that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casanova was allowed to exchange books with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellow prisoners, the Count Aquinas and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobleman known as Balbi. The prisoners took</seg><seg type="columnLine">full advantage of this privilege and they began</seg><seg type="columnLine">a correspondence in Latin in the margin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the volumes they exchanged. Casanova pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed that, since he was being watched, Balbi</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have the dagger and c9t first one hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ceiling of his cell and then another</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into Casanova's room. By concealing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a large volume, Casanova was able to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weapon in Balbi's hands. After two months</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way to escape was clear. On the last day</seg><seg type="columnLine">of October in 1756 they planned to make their</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the last moment Count Aquinas chose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain behind, but he let Casanova have some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of his money to aid the venture. Balbi and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casanova hacked their way through the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead roof, but when they saw the full moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining brightly down upon them they knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that several hours must elapse before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make the climb on the rooftop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After waiting until the moon set, they tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more. Casanova's efforts were hampered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incompetent and blundering Balbi, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">separation was impossible. They crawled about</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the steep roof for some time before Casanova</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered a small dormer window on a lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">level which could be reached. With the rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blankets he had wisely thought to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, he was able to lower the unhelpful</seg><seg type="columnLine">Balbi so that he could enter the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Casanova's descent was now complicated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that there was nothing to which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could attach the rope. After more exploration</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found a ladder. While trying to move it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the dormer window, he lost his footing, slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped over the edge of the roof, and hung over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street supported solely by his elbows. Putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth his last ounce of energy he was able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull himself to safety. There he lay for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantic moments trying to regain his sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance and security. Finally he was able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerk the ladder into the correct position and</seg><seg type="columnLine">join Balbi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As trencherous as their position was, Casanova</seg><seg type="columnLine">could go no further. He ignored the frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmurings of his companion and lay down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor to sleep. Balbi woke him just before</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn and together, with the aid of the trusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">dagger, they forced the locks of successive doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they found themselves in the vast audience</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber which was separated from the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">staircase by a gate of massive bronze. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not continue by their own efforts and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to wait there until daybreak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the arrival of morning people began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move about in the public square below. Casa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nova was able to catch the attention of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who told the doorkeeper that someone had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut up in the palace. When the doorkeeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlocked the bronze doors, Casanova and Balbi</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran past him and down the staircase before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could question them. The escape from Venetian</seg><seg type="columnLine">territory into friendlier lands was managed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot and by carriage. It was not as easy as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casanova had at first believed, but with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">talent for resourcefulness the feat was success-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully performed. He lied, borrowed, acted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole his way to freedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the rest of his life, as he wandered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one country to the next, he told and retold this</seg><seg type="columnLine">harrowing tale of his escape. At the dining</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables of royalty in France, England, Poland,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Austria, and Russia this tale was recited. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his old age, when the "dandies" of the court</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell into disfavor, when Casanova was penniless</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unable to borrow more money, his story</seg><seg type="columnLine">was penned and published.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I 11J 7J B|B1T I |TIT It seemed to be a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">"-■Jil.

It was through those</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows that the gibbering came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought for a moment I was dream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I lay still, with my eyes fixed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big patch of pinkish blue that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the changing of moonlight into dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came again. A low, throaty, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sane noise that grew in volume.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I slipped from the bed and flattened</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall as a shadow swayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the fluttering curtains. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow suddenly came into silhouette</seg><seg type="columnLine">and developed into something out of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror picture. It seemed tall, incred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ibly tall, though it stooped grotesquely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its body was covered with coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. But the head was what started</seg><seg type="columnLine">me talking to myself. It was flat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, covered with scales, and swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">from side to side as though set on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pivot. The snout protruded and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws opened and closed with rhythmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularity. An odor of rotting flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept in through the windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it came into complete view I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dived for my suitcase, where I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">.32. The thing was carrying a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I got to the window, I heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thud. It had dropped from the bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cony with its burden, and I could see it</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurrying, crab-like, across the lawn. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't dare aim at it from that distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fear of hitting the girl, but I blazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away over its head and saw it drop her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and streak for the heavily wooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks of the lake which bordered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far end of the sloping terrace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DEATH ON LOCATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T WHIPPED into a bathrobe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounded down the stairs and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the lawn. Then I stopped dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment. A figure, glistening in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight, had risen from the beach of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake and was running towards me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I dodged behind a bush and waited un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til the figure was opposite, then I dived</seg><seg type="columnLine">for its legs. It was Bill Drake. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted and started to light, then recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized me.	|</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's all the shooting?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You swimming this time of morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">--before daybreak?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded. "Yeah. I couldn't sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was on the beach and thought I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said "Some refugee from Franken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stein dragged a girl by my window. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a pot shot at it, and it dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">her near the lake." I had pulled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back towards the pond. "There she</seg><seg type="columnLine">is now," I added as a form on the grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">became visible in the moonlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drake struck a match. "God! It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Betty!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the grass, her clothes half torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her body, Betty Williams lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimpering. I dropped down beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and laid my hand against her throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A fast pulse pounded. "She's O.K.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just out from fright."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drake lifted her and she moaned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Everything's all right," he said. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Bill."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take her back to the house and give</seg><seg type="columnLine">her a shot of brandy," I said. "I'm go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to look around for that small edition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of King Kong."	_</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I slipped fresh cartridges into the .32</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushed into the heavy underbrush</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I had seen the monster disappear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few broken bushes showed where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fled; but the 1 rail was soon lost in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness. I went on toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake, but, after half an hour of wander-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the ground became so marshy that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it was almost impossible to go further.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned back, cut sharply to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, and came to the cottage of Mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dings, the caretaker. When I knocked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no response. However a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light showed through a shaded window</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I tried the door. It was unlocked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I entered I sucked in my breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the floor, with lips tightly curled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hideous grin of death, lay an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. Her eyes, almost protruding</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her head, seemed to be fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight on my face. I half expected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear a scream of insane laughter come</seg><seg type="columnLine">tearing out of that horribly grinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. Something had torn away her</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. Blood still welled softly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ghastly wound into an ever-widen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing circle on the worn carpet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced around the ill-lighted room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yanked at the .32 when I spotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a figure crouched in a corner. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">relaxed. It was a girl of about eighteen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A rough gingham dress, faded and torn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung to her body. She was barefoot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her face--beautiful in a savage way</seg><seg type="columnLine">--spoke of stark terror. I walked to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you doing here?" I asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Me and Maw come over to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake?" the girl stammered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At five o'clock in the morning?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, sir. We come over last night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We live a ways down the creek. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">we started home, Maw got skeered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we come back. Jake let us sleep here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said he'd take the tool house out</seg><seg type="columnLine">back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded towards the corpse on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. "Was she your mother?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl kept her eyes on mine. "Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir.

A product of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swampland, beautiful, half-savage, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mass of black hair framing her oval,</seg><seg type="columnLine">olive face, she was shivering like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH MYSTERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">high-strung, sleeping dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Jake Middings now?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She lifted well-rounded shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I reckon he went up to the big house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I woke up when somebody was shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.

Bill Drake sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside her, an empty glass in his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Smythe stood by with a bottle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelling salts. The brandy and salts</seg><seg type="columnLine">had partly restored the girl's nerves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jane Morgan ran to me as I entered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had a touch of her old man's square,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubborn jaw, but her face would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a movie scout turn handsprings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Betty told me what happened," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Did you find anything?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Middings, the caretaker, came in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted my reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Jane," he said.

"Mister, did you really</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Middings was a typical son of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil. A large man, stooped from a life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time of hard work, and a face lined from</seg><seg type="columnLine">squinting in the Florida sun. He rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands together and I could hear a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering rasp from his calloused</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm. His voice was a soft-spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">Southern drawl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded to his question. "Yes.

I asked sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ever since the last big wind," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "folks been talking about some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing prowling the swamps nights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dogs been bit and tore on dry land</seg><seg type="columnLine">where no 'gator ever was, yet the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">they was chewed up was just like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">'gator does.

"You kidding?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shrilled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him no, and explained what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened that morning. We walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on towards the house. He kept shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his head. "You know, there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been tales going around the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">about an alligator that waits on its hind</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, and has eyes that flash fire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sort of rot--You sure you saw this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing?" He was staring at me now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had reached the steps of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house.

For a moment I had an eerie</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that those twigs and branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed as though alive. Palm trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattled their fronds with a noise like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of giant lizards slithering over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A raindrop hit my forehead. Glanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up, I saw that clouds were gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast and obscuring the sun. I hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the woods at the far end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake, reaching them just as the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rain came down in crashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">106</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH MYSTERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sheets as I halted by a huge fallen palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the edge of the lake. It had left a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small cave where its roots had been, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this I crept. The waters of the lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapped into the front of the hole, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">further back it was drier. 1 crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, watching the storm for almost an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. In spite of my uncomfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">position, the steady pounding of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain made me drowsy. My eyes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become fixed on a little pool of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cave. The rain made the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face shimmer like silver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As suddenly as it came, the tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm stopped. The water of the lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivered and became placid. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool I had been watching became mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror-clear. As I crawled from under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, a bright object on the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pool caught my eye. I rolled up my</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve, thrust my arm down, and picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a coin. Kneeling in the water, I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined it and found it to be an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish gold doubloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then it came again--that insane</seg><seg type="columnLine">gibbering, starting low and increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in volume until it reached a screaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">crescendo, hammering upon my ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mirrored in the pool was the image of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monster, poised over me, its mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening and closing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to roll and pull my gun, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monster crashed down, and thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">me into the pool. My head smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a stone and the lake and palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees seemed to spin. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell of rotting flesh as claw-like hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed around my throat. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water closed over me and I was out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T WOKE up slowly to a throbbing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> headache. I heard a slight rustling</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise and opened my eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Feelin' better?" a soft voice drawl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked up.

Here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She handed me a steaming glass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiskey toddy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I drank obediently, studying the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had changed from the gingham</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress she had worn when I first saw her</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a pair of jeans and a man's shirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I finished the drink and fumbled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass to the floor. "How'd I get here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lissa?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I fetched you," she answered with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick smile. "Found you laying in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path just outside this cabin, with a knot</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your head and you soaking wet."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The drink burned pleasantly in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach and the throbbing of my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsided. My mind skipped back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake, the rain, and gold coin and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gibbering thing that smelled of putre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied flesh. I sniffed and wondered if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the odor there in the cabin was a trick</seg><seg type="columnLine">of imagination. No, it was there--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint, elusive smell of the dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shoved the blankets aside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung my feet to the floor. The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said I was lying on the path outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin. I went to a window and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed back the flour-sack curtains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rank undergrowth pushed against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to Lissa. "How far is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the lake?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Bout half a mile. Judging by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bump on your head, I figger you wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered around and happened to end up</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. The path leads from the lake."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She turned towards the kitchen. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got your jacket drying by the stove.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll get it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Lissa disappeared through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, I wondered how she knew I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from the lake. Funny she didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask about the crack on my head. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">DEATH ON LOCATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">107</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was supposed to be at the Morgan</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. Obviously, she had come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her cabin through the rainstorm, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause she had changed clothes. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffed again. That damned smell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotting flesh--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced about the room. Dimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlined on a packing case, at the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, ticked a battered alarm clock. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked towards it. Four o'clock. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been morning when the monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked me. I had been unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">several hours, if that clock was right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt dizzy again, and rubbed my hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">over my face and massaged my eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the blur disappeared, my eyes fo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cused on the packing case. Stencilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its sides was "MARINE EQUIP.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SALVAGE CO., KEY WEST." I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if it had contained parts for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor boat, then remembered that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake boasted of nothing more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of row boats and three canoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rJpHE entrance of Lissa interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">my thoughts. Over one arm she</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried my jacket, and in her hand was</seg><seg type="columnLine">another steaming glass. As she brushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the kitchen door I noticed even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more strongly that stench of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From outside came a crackle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">underbrush. The girl's eyes widened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her gaze shot towards the window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The drink she held slopped over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned her hand; the glass crashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor. She turned madly and dived</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the kitchen, slamming the door. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a bolt shot into place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to the window and listened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something was coming. The brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped and swished but the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth along the path hid whatever it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was from view. I picked up my jacket</seg><seg type="columnLine">from where Lissa had dropped it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran my hand into its pockets for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. It was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A heavy iron poker leaned against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clay fireplace. 1 hefted it, flattened</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall by the door, and waited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a footstep on the porch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorknob turned slowly. I raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lissa!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Jane Morgan's voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I pulled the door wide. The girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained face turned to one of relief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tom. Thank God. I was afraid you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rubbed the welt on my forehead but</seg><seg type="columnLine">said nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jane's gaze swept the cabin. "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lissa here? She left the house shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">after you did. I thought she had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be with her mother at the cabin."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lissa came quietly into the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned against the kitchen door. Hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">smouldered in her eyes as she glared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane. "If you city folks hadn't come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down here, maybe--" She stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fear again crept into her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe what?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She became sullen. "Nothing," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned back to Jane. "Did Mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dings get back with the sheriff?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head. "No. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I'm so worried. Neither he nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sterling returned. I'm afraid the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught them. There's a creek to ford</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Femdale road, and it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooded."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I whipped into my jacket. Things</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clearing. I grabbed Jane's arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come on. We're going back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. This alligator scare is still on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loose and there's no telling where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it'll strike next. Besides, I've got a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of swimming to do before dark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jane looked at me to see if she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard right. "Swimming?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded. I would explain later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have you a gun at the house?" I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her as we pushed through the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Bill Drake has one. We used</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to shoot at tin cans the first day we</seg><seg type="columnLine">108</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH MYSTERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">got here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three of us reached the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as it was getting dusk. I went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my room, changed into swimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunks and came downstairs. Drake</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed me his gun and started to ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions, but I brushed him aside. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was getting dark. I needed daylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every minute counted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I started at a trot across the acre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide lawn, then slowed to a cautious</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk as I pushed into the tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth and headed for the deep end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake. It was a twenty-minute walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it skirted the caretaker's cottage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The house was in shadows and the clap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boards weather-worn--a crypt for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdered body of Maw Tober.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT LAST I reached the lower end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lake and stood beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen palm where I had met the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster a few short hours before. I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">around for any sign of life, but only an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eerie silence prevailed. The sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">"pung" of a bull-frog convinced me I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was sinking fast but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water was still clear. I could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandy bottom. I took a deep breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dived straight down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The depth was deceptive. I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper and deeper and my lungs started</seg><seg type="columnLine">aching. The lump on my head began</seg><seg type="columnLine">its crazy tattoo into my brain but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought my way to the bottom. At last</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt sand against my fingers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scooped frantically with both hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hugging the sand close to my chest, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked my way to the surface, where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped for air. Then I looked at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. There were three gold coins in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, similar to the one I had found during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm. The bottom of the lake at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that point was covered with the scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered gold of some ancient treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A faint breeze stirred across the lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought to my nostrils the smell of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">death. Dead leaves rustled in the path</seg><seg type="columnLine">above me on the edge of the lake. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">gibbering rose and fell. I ducked un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der water and stroked silently to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhanging bank. Directly over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave where I had laid a towel, weighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with the gun, was the alligator-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster. Its head pivoted wildly, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws opening and closing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ducked under water again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked my way fifty feet from the cave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slipping out onto the path, now al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most hidden in the darkness, I crept on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and knees towards the yammer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly there was a wild scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a woman's throat. I jerked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dived for the cave. By the water's</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, struggling in the grasp of the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster, was Lissa. She was fighting against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the claw-like hands that gripped her</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I went into a flying tackle it saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and dropped the girl. I landed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">belly-flopper on the towel and gun, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to roll upright. I held the .32</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimed at the belly. "Hold it," I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"or you'll get blasted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only an insane scream came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature as it sprang. I slammed four</seg><seg type="columnLine">slugs into its belly in mid-air. It be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came limp as it fell, and a human,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gurgling cough belched from it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesque mask that formed the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">lolled wildly a moment, then was still.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I jerked it off, revealing Middings. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">caretaker's fast-glazing eyes glared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in impotent hate as a bubble of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood showed at the corner of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. He gagged, and another belch</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought a gush of blood. The stench</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death was sickening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to the girl, who was mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing feeble efforts to get up. I raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">her gently. "Are you hurt?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," she said, and fainted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jane and Bill Drake met us half way</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. They had heard the shots and</seg><seg type="columnLine">DEATH ON LOCATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">109</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">started out to find me. At the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">we forced brandy down Lissa's throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she came to. She stared around</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is Jake dead?" she whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God!" she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean you knew Middings was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monster?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Lissa. "You see, Jake</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a lot of gold. It was a Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure that folks hunted for years</seg><seg type="columnLine">'round here. It'd been buried under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm tree which was blowed down dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the last big wind. When the tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, it flung most of the gold in the deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the lake. Jake told me about it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but said he'd kill me if I told anybody.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He bought a diving suit, but the day he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got it Miss Morgan and her friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jake went crazy over the gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swore you all had come down to take it</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from him.

' Lissa, have you any</seg><seg type="columnLine">raccoon skins at your cottage?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHE nodded. "Yes.

"Go on with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">story." Now I knew where the stench</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from.

"So that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">why he killed her," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Lissa. "Jake got mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we left for home, but he must of run</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead and hid.

In its own peculiar way, newspaper pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licity can and does give prestige to the criminal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially the young delinquent who wishes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">parade his daring before his gang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Realizing the grip of the human interest story</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the public mind, the papers have often played</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up--disregarding the fact that they are stirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">up sympathy toward some of the most brutal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">criminals of their time. The newspapers some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times lay aside their most urgent public duty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing the true facts by concentrating on stir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring up an emotion, whether toward or away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">crime. Sometimes newspapers render a very val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uable service by observing and praising or criti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cizing the activities of officers of the law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the chief criticisms sociologists and crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inologists make against the newspapers has con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned the instituUon known as "trial by news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper." The trial of Bruno Hauptmann for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kidnaping and murder of Colonel Lindbergh's</seg><seg type="columnLine">infant son was simply an extreme example of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">indecencies to which some newspapers will stoop</seg><seg type="columnLine">under such circumstances. Hounding of defense</seg><seg type="columnLine">attorneys for information prejudicial to one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the other; newspaper predictions of the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come of the trial; insistence that officials take</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides; flashing of photographs in court and out;</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of unfair methods to gain admission to court;</seg><seg type="columnLine">assigning reporters to live with relatives of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">accused--these have been some of the questionable</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods used in such cases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Newspaper editors are aware of the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can be a powerful weapon when aimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against crime, and that they carry a terrific burden</seg><seg type="columnLine">of responsibility to the general public.

Damn it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how can you expect me to be frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and open if you keep thinking--" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked the rest off. I'd been shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into his ear. "Never mind," I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went upstairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took a stinging cold shower. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed off the sweat and loosened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves. I sat on the edge of the tub</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking a cigarette and let the air dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. They were so sympathetic, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing, so smart. I grinned sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly at the tiled wall. All right, I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">show them what smart really was. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in fresh clothes and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the cardroom I found a studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to forget the scene I'd made</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty minutes ago. Take me for</seg><seg type="columnLine">granted, in stride, just another guy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They must have agreed among them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves that that was the proper treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment for somebody who was rocky on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his mental base.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat down in the empty chair be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side Bevis and spread a smile around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table. "I'm sorry I cut up, folks,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said. "Let's have: a stack of chips."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ursula, as always, was the banker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She gave me a stack of blues and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stack of whites and marked the total</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on a pad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were glad to have me. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll see some action," Masterson</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloated, and Ursula doubtless thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the game would be good for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The game ran into doldrums. It hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens now and then for no reasons. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards forgot how to match or did at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong time. There was too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">private conversation around the table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sure sign of lagging interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Limit stud poker isn't poker," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said in disgust. "How about pepping</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up with some table stakes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Masterson's eyes glittered. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're talking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobody objected, though Ursula,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who didn't like the games to go too</seg><seg type="columnLine">high in her house, stipulated that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stacks be limited to twenty-five dollars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miriam wisely dropped out, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight players.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^T THE end of a couple of rounds I</seg><seg type="columnLine">owed Ursula for seven stacks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chips. Puzzled glances were directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me. Bevis asked: "What's hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to your game while you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">away?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Play your game," I said.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way I lost. I played high and wild,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapping an opponent with only angles</seg><seg type="columnLine">to back me up. I took one pot and got</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught on all the rest. A housewife</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have shown better acumen in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">penny-ante game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ursula came around to my chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested that maybe I was too tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SPIDER LILY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">115</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me alone," I said, and saw Dietz</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the last turn when he had an obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinch on board. I pulled a case seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make two pair and raked in the chips</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a nasty chuckle. "I'd like to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired like this all the time," I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ursula.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell, I heard you were a player,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dietz growled. "That was nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn fool luck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nobody else commented. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious shaded glances were again</seg><seg type="columnLine">being directed at me. They were get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting the idea. I was still obsessed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">five thousand dollars and was making</seg><seg type="columnLine">these frantic and impossible attempts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At midnight Masterson opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongly with an ace on the first turn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ursula folded. Oliver Spencer, show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a seven, hesitated and then saw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">George hung on with a four. Dietz and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kerry blew. Bevis Spencer kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorously with a queen. And I, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an insignificant five showing, tagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was back to Masterson. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised Bevis' reraise, and Mr. Spencer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer hesitant, kicked it once more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">George decided that he was out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth and turned his nine down. Bevis</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was my turn. There had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough action to indicate what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">what. If Masterson had held aces back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to back, he would have sat tight, merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragging along for the first couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns to keep the others in and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pot for himself. I figured him for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture against his ace, probably a</seg><seg type="columnLine">king. Mr. Spencer very likely held a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of sevens. He wouldn't have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised on less, and yet wasn't too con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fident with a low pair against an open</seg><seg type="columnLine">ace and an open queen. Bevis' queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">bothered me somewhat. I'd have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel him out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I raised. Mutters rose from those</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the table who were out of the hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This looked as if it would build up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your backed fives don't mean a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, Alec," Masterson said. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">many chips have you? I'm tapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had the lowest stack on the table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven dollars. Oliver and Bevis Spencer</seg><seg type="columnLine">both matched the tap and I shoved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my stack, which ended the round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IZ'ERRY was dealing. He slapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nine down beside my five and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowled. He was obviously rooting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me; so were Miriam and Ursula. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a notion that a nice pot would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">good for my morale. Masterson bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a queen which Bevis needed, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spencer a jack, Bevis a tray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Masterson fingered his chips and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the bare space behind my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat back and smiled. "I'm getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a free ride for the rest of this hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's the trouble with table stakes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too bad the wraps aren't off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean no limit?" Mr. Spencer</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. He turned up a corner of his hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">card, as if to reassure himself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged. "It suits me. What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, Masterson?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Masterson grinned lovingly down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his open ace and queen. "To me no</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit means no limit. Let's use the yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low chips at fifty bucks each."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm blowing anyway," Bevis said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"so do what you like."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ursula protested, though not vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously. Poker was in her blood. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">only this hand," she conceded. "At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of it you'll settle up for your yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">chips and we'll go back to table stakes."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masterson, still high man on board,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chipped two yellows. Mr. Spencer, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, had decided not to believe in Mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terson's ace-queen, but all the same he</seg><seg type="columnLine">116</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH MYSTERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was shaky. He saw without re-raising.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said, "I'm bluff-proof," and upped it</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the sudden silence I could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart thump, though I wasn't nervr</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous. I wasn't sweating. This was poker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the faces but two were featureless</seg><seg type="columnLine">blobs circling the table, and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">that concerned me wore the blankness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of long poker experience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute," Masterson said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I expect to pay off at the end of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand if I lose. Can you Alec?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him that I had fifteen hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred dollars and that if it went higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ursula would back me. Ursula wet her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower lip and gave a searching look and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded. Masterson said: "Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. Let's play for real money.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll go two hundred bucks better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a good play by the high man</seg><seg type="columnLine">on board who was certain the other two</seg><seg type="columnLine">held small pairs. It should have chased</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to cover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Spencer pondered. Poker to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a Saturday night's relaxation at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he won or lost a top sum of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred dollars, usually a lot less. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scared beneath that deadpan. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't worry him; he couldn't see me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as more than fives against his sevens.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Masterson could be holding another</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen out of sight or even have aces</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed up from the first. On the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, it was just as likely that Mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terson, with two cards still to be seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was speculating on pairing an ace or</seg><seg type="columnLine">king or queen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Spencer asked Ursula for ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">more yellow chips and counted out</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight of them--four hundred dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering my re-raise and Masterson's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he sat tight, holding his nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I raised it five hundred. Masterson</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked momentarily shocked, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me beyond doubt that he had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">angles. He did no more than see me,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mr. Spencer, afraid of Masterson</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not at all of me, did the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kerry had to be spoken to twice be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he roused himself suffitiently to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal. All three of us bought. I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second open nine, Masterson a king,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Spencer a second open jack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                   It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^JpHE silence dissolved. Everybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the three players started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk it up to relieve the tension. I sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a five and two nines, indicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">two pair; Masterson, showing an ace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen, king, indicated a high pair; Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spencer's seven and two jacks were ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously a pair of sevens and a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Spencer, high now with an open</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of jacks, negligently bought more</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow chips and dropped ten of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the pot. He didn't expect a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn. It was pure show, an expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of triumph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I asked Ursula for more chips. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">said in bewilderment: "Alec, do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what you're doing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've played poker before," I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">dryly. "I'll either win or lose. May I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a thousand dollars worth? I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The silence returned. Ursula's hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook as she pushed the chips to me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued them in motion into the pot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masterson folded as silently as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arabs folding their tents. His high</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair had no meaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Spencer took at least a minute to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make up his mind. The way he fumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his stacks of blue and white chips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were practically worthless in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, showed how puzzled he was:</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I hadn't had fives backed up origi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nally, why had I ridden along? To</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculate. I'd bought a second pair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but so had he, and his two pairs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly he nodded. "You're bucking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the odds without reason, to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SPIDER LILY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">money you want.

Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">call this hand off and return all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was being gracious. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only see me taking one chance' in twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">to draw another five or nine for a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. The odds went higher because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had just as good chance to buy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those weren't odds a poker player in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right mind would accept if it cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as I was investing, except a</seg><seg type="columnLine">player who was frantic for money and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in his senses. He--and they--had</seg><seg type="columnLine">me all figured out. They were so damn</seg><seg type="columnLine">smart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's no law against you going</seg><seg type="columnLine">out," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scowled angrily at me. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this at all. He had too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">money invested to be noble and let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the pot, and at the same time there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no triumph in winning from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crackpot. He counted out ten yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low chips. "If you insist on being</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish, I'll just see you," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the final turn Kerry gave me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">four and Mr. Spencer a ten. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained high man on board. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">elaborately kind, checking with a tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">paternal smile. I wiped it off his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">by chipping a thousand dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" Ursula said. "This is a ridicu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous bluff. Oliver, the poor boy-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chip or get out, Mr. Spencer," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tired smile returned. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the noble gesture in the offing. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">call the debt off when the hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown. It wasn't ethical t(T take candy</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a baby or a madman. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned up my hole card. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">J70R long seconds they were dazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Masterson leaned sideways, past</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ursula, to make sure my three nines</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't spots before his eyes. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spencer looked sick. He was a rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, as rich men went in West Amber,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was a lot of money to lose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I raked in the chips and started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stack them -- yellows and blues and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whites, mostly yellow. I heard Dietz</seg><seg type="columnLine">say in wonder: "Holy cats! You</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed those first raises with only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine in the hole and a five showing! Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the dumb luck!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Luck?" Kerry was washing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck and grinning broadly. "You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">just seen poker played, mister."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like my missus plays it," Dietz</seg><seg type="columnLine">said sourly.

I started to count</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have to understand what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">happening," Kerry told Dietz. "Alec</seg><seg type="columnLine">played for five thousand dollars. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">small losses didn't concern him; only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one big killing. Didn't you notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way he was playing, looking at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two cards to see if he was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right position? Sometimes he specu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated wildly to put us off guard, to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">us think he hadn't any brains left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he caught a nine in the hole and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a five showing, he played the open five</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a pair. Why not? What did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to lose except for a few dollars to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a look at the next card? He'd tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">it before and it hadn't worked, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner or later it would. He pulled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine to match his hole card and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">set! Did you notice how he sucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in to remove the limit? That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the master plan. From that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time on the odds were on his side. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spencer bought a second pair, but Alec</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught a third nine, and then he really</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to town on a cinch.

Something like a long rod ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended out from it and then merged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the shadow it made.

I veered toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shape was gone in the darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard the familiar swish of brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">when somebody crashes through it.

The gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man hears and sees Alec's car pull up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sees Alec come up to the house be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind a flashlight.

Not this gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He blandly goes ahead and kills</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schneider as if he had all the world to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Then he runs. Alec, who's</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to have sense, chases him un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed and with his flashlight on. Does</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gunman turn around and shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alec who's a clear target and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">has recognized him?

Then, after shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schneider, he tossed it away in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush. That's another problem we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to face.

My thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars melted away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't know whether the three other</seg><seg type="columnLine">players were professionals like Yard or</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealthy amateurs like Locust, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sure there wasn't anything crooked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cards couldn't be marked in any way I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't spot and I had taught myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to recognize and duplicate all the tricks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of card mechanics. Nothing like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being pulled here. The cards didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall right for me or I was being out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">played. These players weren't Ursula</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Oliver Spencer or Art Masterson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the big league.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was halfway through my second</seg><seg type="columnLine">stack of chips when a man and a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in. Yard greeted the woman as</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Baby" and the other men called her</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bertha. The man with her they called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walt. He pulled up a chair to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me and bought chips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was my lucky night, if not at</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards. Here were all three of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first stage of my search was ended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walter was the man who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the roadhouse with Helen Spencer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Don Yard and Lily and again at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bungalow when Yard hit Oliver</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spencer. A long face that was like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank wall, Helen had described him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was adequate Add a chin like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spade to it and dull little eyes which</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed as much emotion as a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SPIDER LILY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">139</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man's. He didn't have to change his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face for poker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gERTHA KALEMAN had hair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame. It was too good to be nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ural.

She was big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger than Lily had been, taller and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuller. But Lily had been beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Bertha Kaleman only stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up your blood pressure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was sitting next to Don Yard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at his cards. Her eyes lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caught me appraising her. Her red</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth threw me a sensuous smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't I know you?" she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not, "Do I know you?" meaning I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know you and please introduce</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself.

Could she have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the trial with Yard? No, Helen, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had met them both, would have recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized them and told me. I was fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening myself with shadows formed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd never have forgotten you if we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">met," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Locust mumbled a belated introduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Berkowitz," she said, leaning her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms on the table.

My stack was sinking danger-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ously low and I had only a few hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred dollars left in my pocket. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">played as tightly as I could, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't do it. There was too little</seg><seg type="columnLine">money between myself and disaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because if I dropped all my money</seg><seg type="columnLine">here I was through. I could support</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself by getting a job, any job, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no more taste for being a fugi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive indefinitely than for burning in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chair or rotting in jail or going mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a madhouse. I had to have money</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain in contact with Don Yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Bertha and Walter. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">way I could do it except through poker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was in now. I was one of them. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be invited to other games in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yard played. But not if I was broke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not if I had a job where I would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">make enough in a month to participate</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a single one of these pots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was one way to get a stake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ethics of it I could take in stride.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These men were gamblers or rich and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could afford to contribute to my at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to regain my life. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly dangerous. It wouldn't be an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibition before friends to show how</seg><seg type="columnLine">clever I was with cards. These men</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew all the tricks. You had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than good to fool them. Better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than perfect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rJ_'HE deck was three deals away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I sweated those deals out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing my hand in as soon as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at it. Walter, on my right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought out a new deck for his deal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had two high pairs, but I went out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raked in the discards and washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. There was some hot action be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween a man named Silver and Yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Locust, so that nobody paid at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention to me shuffling and reshuffling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yard won. I scooped up the remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing deck and shuffled some more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, deal," Judson said. "Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">140</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH MYSTERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you want to wash the spots off them?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I placed the deck before Locust on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my left. He cut it only in two, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">generally did. I'd banked on that. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealt the way I always did, rapidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yard said: "What's the rush?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stopped. A vein pounded in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple. "What's that?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take it easy," Yard said. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the cards dealt slow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I forced a grin to the surface. "Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure," I said and continued to flick</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cards out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sank back a little when the round</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dealt. I didn't have to look at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards. There were three queens. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that a man named Smollens was</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding three aces and Silver two high</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair. The other hand had fallen any</seg><seg type="columnLine">way they had come up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Locust must have bought some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing good. He opened strong. Smol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lens was enthusiastic about his three</seg><seg type="columnLine">aces and raised. Silver tagged along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his two pairs. Yard looked at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards and then across the table at me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and folded. So did Judson and Walter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shoved in my stack. The three who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in saw me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the draw I dealt the cards</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight except to myself. I gave myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">a full house. None of the others helped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pot was mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I leaned forward to pull in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chips, my eyes tilted up to Yard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">craggy face. He was watching me</seg><seg type="columnLine">flatly, without expression. My heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipped a couple of beats. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. There was talk between Smol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lens and Silver about how neither of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them had been able to fill all night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Locust was gathering up the cards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The game continued. I had my stake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gods of chance are not con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned with morals. From that deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">on I won. At four o'clock in the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing I walked out with eleven thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand dollars in cash and checks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Yard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   ALTER was waiting for me on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madison' Avenue. He said tone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly: "Around the corner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both hands were thrust deep into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets of his jacket. He had a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one of those hands or he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been more polite. I looked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street and then down the street. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hour it was quiet enough to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself breathe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's around the corner?" I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don. He wants to see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We walked side by side to the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the block and turned right. A snappy</seg><seg type="columnLine">sedan stood twenty feet down from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. Bertha Kaleman sat behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wheel. She said pleasantly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hello, Berky."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The back door on the curb side</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened. "Get in, kid," Don Yard said</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the back seat darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat beside him Walter followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, climbing over Yard's feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine, and sat at my left. Bertha had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front seat to herself, probably the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time in her life she was left sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone when there were men around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She drove west to Sixth Avenue, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">south, then west again. Nobody said</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything. I wondered why I wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">more scared. A week ago I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightened up and started to sweat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake. Now I was chiefly curious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Between Tenth and Eleventh</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avenues Bertha stopped the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's have the dough, kid," Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yard said crisply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were shadows on either side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, their thighs pressing against mine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Past Bertha's left shoulder I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightness of the Hudson River speed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. They could find better spots to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So it's a holdup?"

The effect sounded all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to me. Just about enough deri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Don Yard only at the pay-offs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then briefly. Tackling Walter, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned, was a waste of breath, if not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazardous. Bertha Kaleman seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be my best bet, but I couldn't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">her off by herself. Twice I phoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unlisted number to ask her out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunch. The first time there was no an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer.

New York is immense, but even</seg><seg type="columnLine">an out-of-towner like myself was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">bumping into acquaintances.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">game resumed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'd been due for a streak of bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards. It had started before Magee's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival, and the fact that he was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting beside me didn't help my play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I tightened up, supporting only</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinches, and was lucky to get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a loss of only a couple of thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand dollars.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dipped my face into my program.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anybody coming for a smoke?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walter asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yard and Bertha said that they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">sit the intermission out. I said, "Same</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," and at the moment I heard my</seg><seg type="columnLine">name called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, Alec!" the voice shouted en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiastically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clip Larsen was standing at the aisle</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat four rows down and waving to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went hollow inside. I glanced to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. Yard and Bertha sitting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walter standing were watching Clip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he saw that I wasn't coming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he started to come to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sprang up to intercept him before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got close enough for them to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever he would say to me. I tripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Yard's feet. "Pardon me; there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friend of mine," I panted. Walter</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed back against his raised seat to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give me room to pass. I met Clip</seg><seg type="columnLine">halfway.	|</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thing was certain: he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SPIDER LILY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">155</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">know about Lily or that I was wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the police. Otherwise he wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have shaken my hand so heartily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduced me to his mother and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl he was engaged to marry. For half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen flights he had been bombardier</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our B-29. Then he got dengue fever</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after he recovered he'd been trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to another ship. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver bar on his shoulder now instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a gold one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For a small eternity I stood there at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their seats shooting the breeze with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and his mother and his girl. Clip</seg><seg type="columnLine">was leaving at two in the morning for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Florida base and the women felt bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it, though he hoped to get his</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharge before winter. I saw Walter</seg><seg type="columnLine">return from the lobby. I kept talking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't know about what, though air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men are always full of gossip. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curtain buzzer sounded, I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Don Yard asked the inevitable ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for the three of them as soon as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was settled in my seat. "What did</seg><seg type="columnLine">that soldier call you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Al," I said. I leaned past Bertha,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered my voice discreetly. "My name</seg><seg type="columnLine">is really Alfred Jeffery. I dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alfred and added the Berkowitz when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was kicked out of the Army. I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came friendly with Lieutenant Larsen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hospital in India. We both had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dengue fever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to sound good enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Yard nodded and watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second act curtain rise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOON as the show ended I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained that I was agoing to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men's room and left in a hurry. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a full ten minutes I stayed out of sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the time I came up the theater was</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. The three of them were waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me under the marquee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Walt and I have some business,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yard said to me. 'How about doing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me a favor and taking Bertha home?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said I'd be glad to. Yard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walter walked off and I left Bertha to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunt up a taxi in the after-theater rush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I walked from Forty-fifth Street to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forty-first before I managed to drag an</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty one back with me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the taxi I took Bertha's hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She let it lie limp. She didn't turn her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face to me. With Yard beside her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the theater she had been anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch me. How can you figure out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter?" I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Change your mind since this after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her voice was dull. "It's the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">way around. I found out I've got it</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now you're scared of Don?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More than you think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't like it. I had no desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get in too deep with her now or to hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">her later. She was all right. I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done better with her than with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lily, if I'd had any business with either</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them or any woman like them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We held emotionless hands until we</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the gray brick house. I paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the driver and followed her to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">private entrance under the stoop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come in," she said woodenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tagged in after her. She switched</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the living room light and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">her cream-colored ermine wrap on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair as if it were a rag. She wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">green strapless evening gown. Her fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure had no trouble holding it up with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out visible supports. This was like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sophisticated comedy, the scene set for</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion. I wasn't particularly happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she wasn't having any just then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She went to the bleached oak desk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened a lower drawer. A pile of news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers lay in it. I knew then what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming. I stood watching her, numb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without the ability to think. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">156</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAMMOTH MYSTERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">selected one paper, looked at it, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked over to me without sex in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements. She dropped the paper on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coffee table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alexander Linn," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> JUST stood there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said down to my photo in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper: "That officer in the theater</seg><seg type="columnLine">called you Alec. It wasn't Al, like you</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, but Alec. Since Lily was mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered this paper has come to the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">every Thursday and it's full of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of Alexander Linn, or Alec Linn</seg><seg type="columnLine">as even the paper calls him mostly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it came out at the trial that Linn</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a cracker jack poker player and he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been fighting in India.

And how did you know so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Lily's murder and why were you</seg><seg type="columnLine">always wanting to talk about her if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd never known her? I sat between</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and Don in the dark theater and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to remember the picture of Alec</seg><seg type="columnLine">Linn I'd seen in this paper.

"I never thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody could get inside me like you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have," she said. "But it's too late.

Once somebody was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedging on a bet he'd lost to Don. Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Walt took him for a drive in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car. They didn't say much. They just</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him look at a gun, like they did with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you the time they took your roll. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they drove him home. Don said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's legs were so weak he could hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk from the car across the sidewalk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his house. The next day he paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. That was what Lily wanted Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do to whoever she was scared of.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don was sore at her. I know why; he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been angling to get her back and she'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned him down.

One of us would have noticed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">before this if he had been there long.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But a single moment was enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He removed a d}'ing cigar from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">craggy face. "Very touching," he ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bertha's head butted my chin in</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting toward the voice. "Oh, God!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she moaned.. She sagged lower on me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly dead weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Don Yard came toward us as wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inexorable as a tank. His arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung loosely with the short, strong fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers spread. Then Bertha's hair hid</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from me. It got in my mouth. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard her say thinly, "Don!" but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't the strength to entangle herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from me. I slid my face free of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair and saw him again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had reached the white coffee table</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had picked up the Hale County</seg><seg type="columnLine">Star. He looked at my photo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is he Linn?" Walter asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walter's presence hadn't registered</seg><seg type="columnLine">before this. He'd been only the back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, standing against the farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall with both hands in his pockets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigarette smoke weaving up over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, impassive face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think?" Yard said. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">bothered me where I'd seen him before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was in this paper." His voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tired monotone. "Alexander Linn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rat who likes the women I like.

She threw both arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">around my neck, sitting high on me</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Her half-bared perfumed breasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed into my face. I couldn't see</seg><seg type="columnLine">or breathe. Suddenly I felt more ridic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulous than afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don, he didn't kill Lily!" she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For heaven's sake, give him a chance."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I gave him a chance to be alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you," Yard told her in that dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice he was using tonight.

She rose to her feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">under her own power and took a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of swaying steps to the side of the chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then reached out to cling to its high</seg><seg type="columnLine">back.

"I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only one who knows,who he is."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The gun lay flat on Yard's broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm. His finger wound about the trig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger. "You can't say a thing I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing. Convincing him that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't murdered Lily, if I could con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vince him, still left my marriage to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Lily and my love-making with Bertha.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">\X7ALTER had come across the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Yard's side.

Yard said. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun cut a small arc in the air in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my chest. "The car's over on Ninth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avenue.

Dying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the anticipation of dying, wasn't the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardest part of it. For two years I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeled myself, with a certain amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatalistic success, to accept the coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death at any hour.

Please!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who wants you any more?"

Yard fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I passed within five feet of Bertha.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had her back to us now and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagging broken and helpless over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk. She did not turn her head for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">last look at me. I stepped through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'"jpHE shots were blurred coughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds, two or three or four of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlapping. When I turned, Don Yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already on the floor. A hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">flapped weakly out to claw the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Persian rug and suddenly died, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming one with the inertness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of that wide and solid mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh and bones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gun was in Bertha's hand. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a tiny pearl-handled revolver held</seg><seg type="columnLine">against her right hip. She leaned limply</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the top open drawer of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk, the drawer in which Don Yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have kept that extra gun. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth opened and closed and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened and closed, but no sound came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My eyes searched for Walter. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming slowly toward me with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands still in his pockets. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached Yard, he squatted and took out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">both his hands. No gun was in either.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt the motionless flesh. The veil</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained over his eyes, but a corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth started to twitch as if fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a smile. "You got him good, sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart," he said and stood up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He listend to the street outside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house above us. The stillness</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained. ft was doubtful if any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body had been awakened by the shots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or hearing them had recognized them</seg><seg type="columnLine">as shots. The sound of a .22 revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no louder than a hand slapped sharp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly on a table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Walter strolled leisurely over to Ber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tha and reached for the gun.

Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft, slurred undertones did not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't care what he was saying. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was up to me, to think faster and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">accurately than ever before in my life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I couldn't. I was shaking hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. Physically I was all right; I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding together. But that might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a hopeless acknowledgement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">final defeat as I stood beside a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">body for the third time in two months.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three strikes and out. Bast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bertha and Walter were coming to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward me. His arm was intimately, pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessively, about her waist.

The pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture didn't quite fit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They skirted around the dead man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bertha's eyes were fixed straight ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that she wouldn't have to look at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">or at me. Walter stepped behind her</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SPIDER LILY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">161</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to give her room to get through the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked back at me. "Let's talk in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other room," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">J.TE WAS snapping the light on when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I entered. It was the dining room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bertha stood at the wall mirror pinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">up her hair. It had become somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">undone while she'd been sitting on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's the play, kid," Walter said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. "First the part that concerns</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and Bertha. We didn't come home</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the show with Don. We went</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere for drinks and maybe a</seg><seg type="columnLine">party. He told us he had a date with</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody here at twelve, though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't tell us who, and went right home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The idea is he wanted to be alone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whoever he was meeting. I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of pals around who'll alibi Ber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tha and me, guys who owe me favors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In an hour or so I'll get one of them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone the police on a dial phone that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was passing this house and heard shots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'll say he doesn't want to be bothered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with red tape, so he won't give his name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'll hang up and beat it. All right. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing is, when the call comes in, Bertha</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I will be where a hundred people</seg><seg type="columnLine">will see us. Some of them will say</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've been there since eleven-thirty."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm wanted for murder anyway, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">one more won't matter," I said grimly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I take the rap for Bertha. Is that it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, Berky," Bertha said, giving her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair a final pat. "We're all in this to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether and we'll get out together."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walter nodded. "That's it, kid. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">in together, like the three musketeers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the cops pick you ujffor this, you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">say Bertha did the shooting--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To save my life from Don. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">legitimate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe a jury will believe that's why</seg><seg type="columnLine">she shot him, maybe it won't. We don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to take the chance. If the cops</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick you up, you'll say it was Bertha</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and they'll break her into confessing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll do it; I know how those babies</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. So the idea is to make sure the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cops don't pick you up for this. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you won't go to them and squeal</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Bertha because you're wanted for</seg><seg type="columnLine">another killing. There's no chance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and Bertha doublecrossing each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where do you come in?" I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sent a thin smile to Bertha. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down at the floor, then sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one of the dining table chairs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">elaborately smoothed out the table-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloth. It cleared up then. She had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deal with him. He had always wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and now he could have her if he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">us both out of this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm doing it for Bertha," he told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that ghost smile pasted to his long</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. "Now start thinking, kid. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">many people know you were working</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Don?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nobody, unless Earl Locust was</seg><seg type="columnLine">told."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a chance.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped at his feet to look down at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the first time I saw the hole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of his head.

Only a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead slug from an almost toy-like .22 re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver.

Three corpses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">three different weapons, but only a rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented a serious problem after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">act.

It was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spicuously connected to the owner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar possession, a piece of furniture</seg><seg type="columnLine">decorating a wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aren't you through, Berky?"

I could have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">West Amber by this morning, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tried to time it to arrive under cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">of darkness. That hadn't quite worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. My last lift, a salesman bound for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cleveland, would have passed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">West Amber a couple of hours before</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight. I had dropped off three miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the town and had hidden in</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods until darkness permitted me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk unseen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lights of the house were bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hospitable and cozy. I hadn't had</seg><seg type="columnLine">real sleep in two nights, I was grimy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unshaven, I was still a fugitive--but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt more secure and rested and looser</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside than in months. In years. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was home. That first homecoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly two months ago had been a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuation of the horror, subdued usu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, sometimes bursting in your brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">like shrapnel, that was war and living</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time of war. This was home now</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all I wanted in it--a girl waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me on a porch step.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I cut across the lawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She saw me when I crossed the drive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way.

I couldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared more to her than a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">form without identity or distinguish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able shape, but suddenly she dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">her cigarette and raced down the steps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she was in my arms, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">kissing her as I had never kissed any</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman but Lily. Not even Lily, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a consuming yearning in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting of our mouths that was pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion and beyond passion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Darling, I knew you'd come back,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miriam said at last, the words rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her in a flow of emotion.

I could not give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chance to dispose of the one physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal link between himself and murder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he was turned to me, his face a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale blob, and his hands were pale too</seg><seg type="columnLine">in moonlight. The right hand was</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised, holding something long and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower half of it not as dull as the rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A carving knife, probably--bigger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealier than the steak knife he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven into Lily's heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must have seen me cutting across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lawn, and had gone outside to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">me enter this room or had listened at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and heard me enter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within the drawing of a breath he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut the distance between us in half. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a large room, and now we stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing each other across five feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SPIDER LILY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">171</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">space. Too late to flee now. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">get me between the shoulders as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled through the window. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bound to this room, to settle it</seg><seg type="columnLine">here within the next minute or two, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematics of our lives reduced to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowest common denominator. He or I.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He killed me or 1 killed him by turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him over to the police.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped. I jerked myself side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, away from the knife, and I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blade rip through jacket sleeve and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt sleeve. There was no pain, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream, compounded of fear and shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rage, tore from my throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fury of the knife-thrust had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken him past me. Momentarily I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him. I managed to get my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on his right arm, below the elbow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wheeled, pushing his shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">against me. My grip loosened, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">again at his wrist, and held on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next minute or hour or year lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail. Always his breath was harsh in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my face, groaning and swearing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing as he strove to free the knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My job was to wrench it from him or</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn it against his own body. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do neither.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were on the floor then, myself on</seg><seg type="columnLine">top clinging to his wrist, while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">clawed my mouth and nose and chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his free left hand. A chair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my legs. We must have knocked it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over when we had fallen, though I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't remember. Blood was in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. I dropped flat on him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed my face into his chest to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tect it. He pulled my hair, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear myself scream, and then I became</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of those other soiuids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rJ''HEY were on the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked door, impotently rattling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knob and pounding on the panel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were shouting too, begging him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the door, begging him to tell them</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was happening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly somebody was in the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us. "Cut it out, you guys!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. Like an adult breaking up a fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two kids. Oh, he was a comed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian all right. Cut it out, he said, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so we would stop and straggle up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our feet and each accuse the other of</seg><seg type="columnLine">having started it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Except that he couldn't stop unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my death. He made a final ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort, heaving up against me with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his strength, tearing at my hands on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wrist, trying to reverse the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife and drive it into my body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The knife!" I gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt hands move down my arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over my locked fingers and to that other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and the knife in it.

Not kill Lily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course. The motive, as I said, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak--at that time. But he went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lily and threatened her if she didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop trying to make Helen a tramp like</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself.

Women looked at his frigid mask of a face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and regarded it as handsome as that of a Greek</seg><seg type="columnLine">God; men idolized him as well. And there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many more who lived in utter terror of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This man was born in Arras, France, in 17S8,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the son of a local judge. In school he proved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a very thorough and ambitious student winning</seg><seg type="columnLine">a much-sought scholarship to a college in Paris</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he studied law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Robespierre was slow to make friends. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">awkward and provincial among the dandies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris. His persona] conduct always remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">above reproach. Day after day he rose early,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed with care, devoted himself to his studies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the evenings submerged himself in the writ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings of Rousseau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inwardly he was the most gentle of men. Ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed as criminal judge in the diocese of Arras</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 1782, he was unable to carry out his duties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In order to avoid pronouncing the sentence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, Robespierre resigned his post.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had Robespierre lived in other than revolution-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ary times, his imprint on history might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely different. But in those hectic turbulent</seg><seg type="columnLine">days he emerged a fanatic of the most dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort. To this day his actions and the reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompting them remain shrouded in mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Robespierre believed in the doctrines of Rous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seau on the rights of man. He was convinced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rousseau's doctrines would regenerate France.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was in Versailles in 1789, at the meeting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the States-General.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke frequently in the Constituent Assembly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was eventually recognized as a leader of a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of the extreme left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he instinctively felt he was making little</seg><seg type="columnLine">headway in the Assembly, he turned to the Jacob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ins, a group of extremists. Although he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor speaker and uncomely in appearance, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power of appealing to the instincts and emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the masses to stir them to hatred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon his voice was heard above all the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Revolution urging the inhabitants of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris slums to avenge themselves for centuries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">oppression and maltreatment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Robespierre stepped in after the Bourbon king</seg><seg type="columnLine">and queen were overthrown and became a mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the Commune of Paris.

But from behind the scenes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he helped spread that panic which swept over</seg><seg type="columnLine">France when the attempted flight of the Royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Family, the organization of an army of refugees</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Rhine region, ancf*rumors of fifth column</seg><seg type="columnLine">activities among the remaining nobles had begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make people expect to find a spy around every</seg><seg type="columnLine">comcr and a traitor in their neighbor's horrfe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton was intrusted with the duty of carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the program of wholesale murder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">execution, while the virtuous Robespierre kept his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands clean of the sordid business.

They hid the knives they hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">some day to stick into each other's back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Robespierre was chosen by the Convention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Committee of Public Safety and made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearers believe that the system of the Terror was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a necessary thing.
