In some places where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less unjustly consider that people are inferior to our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, loads are carried on the back or on the head. When this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is done, friction hardly comes into play at all and some very</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary examples of this carrying of loads are cited among</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians, especially in the southern part of this continent. In old</seg><seg type="columnLine">times we used to often see bricks carried up a ladder in a recep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacle called a "hod", which rested on the shoulder of the work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. This was a very fine example of almost frictionless opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. It is seldom seen now as mechanical elevators of one kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">or another, either steam or electric, do the work and friction</seg><seg type="columnLine">again appears upon the scene. If a heavy stone, too heavy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift, was to be moved in primitive times it would be pushed or</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled by hand along the ground and the greatest effort, relatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking, would be required to move it. The rough surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone scraping along the ground and perhaps digging into it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">generated any quantity of friction. An improvement on this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is still in use, is the so-called stoneboat. This is a fiat</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform of heavy plank with smooth steel straps or runners</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath it intended to take the weight and to slide along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground with greatly reduced friction. The stoneboat, which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only two or three inches thick, avoids the necessity of lifting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. It is really a form of sled, and sleds today play an</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely important part in transporting material in the Arctic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sub-Arctic regions, sliding along on snow and ice with</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly reduced friction. The skater represents a sled as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slides along first on one skate and then on the other, so we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">not gotten rid of plain sliding friction, but in the vast majority</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cases, use it only where there is very little friction to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced owing to the nature of the substances in contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other, generally steel and ice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The total amount of friction depends, of course, on the travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one surface on the other and to reduce this, man invented</seg><seg type="columnLine">an appliance which is one of the most amazing products of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingenuity and which plays an enormous part in the operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world. This appliance is the wheel. If the axle is two</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches in diameter and the wheel three feet, sliding friction, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we may call it, is one-eighteenth of what it would be if the axle</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid directly on the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So far we have spoken of sliding friction, but unfortunately</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is what is known as rolling friction and this is exerted</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the periphery of the wheel and the surface on which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">rests, its roadway. Lubricants, such as oil and grease, diminish</seg><seg type="columnLine">friction and are used as everybody knows in the bearings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery, in the hubs of wheels. The friction between this</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid and a liquid is extremely small and if it were practical to</seg><seg type="columnLine">inject a liquid under the bearing of a wheel or shaft so that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could rest upon a film of oil, if such were the lubricant, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">friction would be extremely small. Very serious attempts have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been made to apply this system and while it is not practical</seg><seg type="columnLine">except in special cases, it has been found that it reduced friction</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an extremely small amount. It has been exhibited in some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great expositions or World's Fairs and produced very strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing effects. It has even been suggested to use it as a lubricant</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a sled sliding in a grooved way, but, of course, it suggests</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inevitably produces a great waste of lubricant. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing surfaces would be drilled full of small holes through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the lubricant was to be forced, giving a layer of pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid instead of a bearing of babbit metal or brass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the early improvements in bicycles was ball-bearings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For heavy work roller bearings were used. The rollers or balls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">relatively small, fit quite closely between the axle and the joint.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything is very smooth, lubricant is added and the balls or</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders, as the case may be, substitute roller friction for fric-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of surface against surface. Recently the roller bearings have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been used very extensively for the bearings of wheels on rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road cars. The next thing should be rubber tires. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting features of ball-bearings is that the manufacture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel balls has developed enormously. It is hard to say what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel ball would have cost in old times, but now the cost of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">is absolutely trivial and the accuracy is extreme. In roller and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball bearings, the balls or rollers, as the case may be, are subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">to very slight flattening. This interferes considerably with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficiency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An interesting thing in friction is what is known as the angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of repose; this is the steepest angle at which any given granular</seg><seg type="columnLine">of material will lie. The sand at the seashore gives an excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">example. If we make a little heap of perfectly dry sand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then move the finger around its base as nearly in a circle as</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be, constantly approaching the center, we will presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a conical heap of sand and the angle which the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cone makes with the base gives you the angle of repose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This varies for different sands and is sometimes quite an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant element to be considered in an engineering project. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is dependent on friction between the grains of sand. If we follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the subject of friction to its fullest extent, we will get quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious and interesting results.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At once the fellow reached up and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my surprise and horror, jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his close-cropped hair in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass--a wig in fact. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">St</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ace</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-T^ocket</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> zjKurders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By Edmond Hamilton</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Author of "The Universe Wreckers/' "The Comet Doom/' etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T^UILDING a ship that 'will successfully travel across the void and safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">■U land on another body in our vast universe is not the only consideration that</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be given the problems of interplanetary travel--when this new dream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists is finally realized.

But I beg</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you at the start to cast aside that thought and to read</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously what I have to tell you. A little incoherence is</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps to be forgiven a man who writes under such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">menacing shadow of death as now hangs over me. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I can see you asking yourself in surprise, "Death from</seg><seg type="columnLine">what?" I wish I knew the answer to that question my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, but I do not. All I know is that across my path</seg><seg type="columnLine">has come a sinister force or forces which I fear may</seg><seg type="columnLine">even this very night bring about my--. . . but there, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will leave all this and tell you the facts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You will remember, no doubt, that in the last ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">months I have been engaged in all the time I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare from my routine work in the School's laboratories</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lecture-halls, in a private research of my own, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">study of rocket-fuels and a search for a fuel more effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient than any now available. As you know, I was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested in this field by Henri Mertaud, the late French</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket-experimenter, whom I met more than a year ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Paris, when attending the International Chemical Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> M. Mertaud was kind enough to show me and Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cyrus Hunger ford, through whom I met him, some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his model and larger experimental rockets. He rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised me by the completeness of his laboratory, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">included what he said was the best vacuum-tank for</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket-tests in the world. He gave me an interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of the work he had carried on in this field for</seg><seg type="columnLine">six years, first in collaboration with Dr. Richard Braun</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Berlin, and after Dr. Braun's death, alone. Mertaud</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dr. Braun, as you know, sent atmospheric rockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">much higher in the stratosphere than any had ever done</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, having greatly improved the designs of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">pioneers as van Hijnn and Morrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> M. Mertaud was convinced, he told me, that rockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his design or improvements of his design might with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently powerful fuel attain a high enough velocity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape entirely from the earth's attraction and travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">through space to the moon or even, at the right time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the planets of Mars or Venus. He even visualized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility of such rockets someday carrying human</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers and being capable of returning to earth. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">this development would logically follow, Mertaud be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved, upon the improvement of rocket-designs and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention of lighter and more powerful fuels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was so interested by M. Mertaud's statements that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told him I would not mind spending some time in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">study of rocket-fuels myself. Mertaud at once took up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suggestion, as he had understood from Dr. Hunger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford that I was a chemist of standing, and the next day</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent me a mass of literature on rocket-designs and fuels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the days that followed, I had several talks with him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">583</seg><seg type="columnLine">584</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the problem, and when I left France, I assured M.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mertaud that as soon as I finished some special work on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, I would devote myself to the rocket-fuel question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did so, a few months after my return, and eventu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally came to use most of my spare time on the problem. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon found that the crux of the matter was to combine</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a single fuel the necessary elements of lightness, power</seg><seg type="columnLine">and quickness of firing. I will not give you the details</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my work, but it is sufficient to say that I soon became</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced, as Mertaud and Braun had become, that pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders were an unsatisfactory form for rocket-fuels, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that liquefied gases offered a better approach than did</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary liquid fuels. I was experimenting with combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of liquid hydrogen with various other liquefied</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases, when the news of M. Mertaud's unfortunate death</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached me four months ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You may remember that Mertaud's laboratory burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and that his charred body was found in it, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">having been apparently trapped by the fire. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed that some of the super-inflammable fuels he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was testing in model rockets had taken fire, for it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalled that his former collaborator in rocket-experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, Dr. Richard Braun, had perished in a laboratory-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire of similar nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course I was shocked by Mertaud's death, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not make me think of giving up my researches, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had now become quite interested in the fuel problem.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no thought whatever that his death was anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the accident it appeared. But I will say at this point</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I am now quite certain that the deaths of Henri</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meraud and of Dr. Richard Braun were not accidental.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will understand shortly how I know this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the time, though/ my only reaction was a sincere</seg><seg type="columnLine">regret for M. Mertaud's unfortunate end, and I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily on with my rocket-fuel experiments. I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">give all the details of my work except to say that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I came to the conclusion that as a fuel-base, liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen had drawbacks that outweighed its advantages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I began to make tests of various combinations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid oxygen, alcohol and other substances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not long after this--about two months ago--I entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into some correspondence with an American physicist</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had taken up the problem of space-rocket design.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This scientist, a Dr. Harris Winn of Detroit Scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">College, was interested in the possibility of designing</seg><seg type="columnLine">small space-rockets capable of reaching the moon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote me asking about some features of Mertaud's work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I answered, mentioning my study of rocket-fuels, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we continued to exchange letters on the subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two weeks ago I published, in the May number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Journal of the Association for the Promotion of Sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, a short article summarizing the present status of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-rocket work, and mentioning, besides the earlier</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of Braun and Mertaud and others, my own work</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rocket-fuels and Dr. Winn's experiments. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first public announcement of my work, and you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon see what consequences it brought in its wake. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, indeed, that its final consequence may be my death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I am again, in my nervousness, outrunning my</seg><seg type="columnLine">story, and must put things in their proper order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tonight, at about ten o'clock, five hours ago from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time I write this, I had a caller. As you know, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">still live and have my private laboratory in the old Mel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford mansion and estate near the School, with only Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nett, my house-man, staying in the place here at night</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me. I was in my study when I heard the bell ring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a moment Barnett brought in to me a card bearing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the entirely unfamiliar name of "Mr. Peter Nebo."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told Barnett to show him in. Mr. Peter Nebo proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rather unusual-looking caller, a squat, stocky man</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in good-quality clothes that fitted him rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly. His black hair was close-cut and his face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were remarkably white and bloodless-looking, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the man were just out of long confinement. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had unprepossessing pale-green eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As this Peter Nebo entered the room, I rose to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. But Mannie, my little rat-terrier, who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsing by my desk, sprang up before me and ran at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my caller, barking furiously and showing his teeth in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminutive snarl. I had Barnett take out the little dog,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then showed Mr. Nebo a chair, and when he was seated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked what I could do for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His pale-green eyes looked at me for a moment with'</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar weighing expression before he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice was deep bass, unusually resonant, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in quite unaccented English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dr. Melford," he said, "I've come on rather a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">errand, which has to do with your article on space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket work published recently in the magazine of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asssociation for the Promotion of Science."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're not a reporter getting a story on the topic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you ?" I asked. Certainly he did not look like one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nebo shook his head. "No, but I and some associates</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mine are very much interested in that article. Espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially in the part of it where you stated that your work</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fuels might materially aid in the launching some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of space-rockets toward other planets. Was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">correct ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was, yes," I told him. "Of course, all this work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine is purely experimental, but, if more efficient fuels</seg><seg type="columnLine">were devised, they would certainly advance tremendously</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possibilities for successful space-rockets."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it is for fuels of such efficiency that you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching?" pressed Peter Nebo. "I mean, you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">working with the fuel-requirements of space-rockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly in mind ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am," I replied, "for such a fuel would have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly specialized. But just what is your interest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, Mr. Nebo? You say you are not a reporter?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You will understand my interest," Nebo answered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"when I tell you that instead of your Association for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Promotion of Science I represent a lesser-known organ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ization that might be called an Association for the Re-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">tardation of Science."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Association for the Retardation of Science?" I re-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated, puzzled. "Is this a joke or am I to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that____"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, let us say for the retardation of a certain field</seg><seg type="columnLine">of science," Peter Nebo amended. "That field, Dr. Mel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford, deals with the research of space-rocket improve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, which might someday lead to extra-terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel and journeys to other planets. Our Association</seg><seg type="columnLine">is unalterably opposed to such journeys ever being made</seg><seg type="columnLine">by men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why?" I asked. "Are your objections theo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not at liberty to state fully the reasons for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand," Nebo said smoothly. "But I will say that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are convinced that man will lose rather than gain by</seg><seg type="columnLine">making contacts with other worlds in space, if that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever possible. We are, in a word, earth-isolationists."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is certainly an unusual viewpoint," I said. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fail to see just what connection this has with my work."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The connection is apparent," said Peter Nebo. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">SPACE-ROCKET MURDERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">585</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">are, by your own admission, experimenting with fuels</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might advance space-rocket design and thus greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase the possibility of travel to other worlds. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">society is determined to forestall such travel from ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking place. We are, therefore, asking you to abandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">your researches in this direction and to destroy all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes and results your work has already yielded you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment I was too much astounded by the cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">effrontery of this request to make answer to it. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I rose to my feet, indignation possessing me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Really, sir, I wonder that you can make such a propo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition!" I said. "To ask a scientist to give up his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">searches because you have some vague objections to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You refuse to do so?" Nebo asked calmly. Somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">his calmness irritated me the more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course I refuse!" I exclaimed. "What made you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I would drop ten months' work at your request?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pale-green eyes of the man opposite me hardened</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he rose. "It is not exactly a request," he told me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is more in the nature of a demand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A demand?" I cried, and he nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and a demand you would do well to heed, Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Melford.

I exclaimed, and Peter Nebo</seg><seg type="columnLine">again calmly nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do. Unless you quit the rocket-fuel researches</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately of your own will, we will use force to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Will you agree to abandon this work?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Nebo," I said furiously, "I will give you one</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute to leave this house. If you do not, I will call</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police. I am only prevented from doing so now by</seg><seg type="columnLine">my conviction that you are mentally unbalanced."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter Nebo looked at me for a moment in silence. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am sorry that this is your answer, Dr. Melford," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and then walked out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was so angered for a few moments after he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, that I was still rather of a mind to summon officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to apprehend the man. But after I had thought it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few minutes it seemed to me so evident that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow was at least partly insane, that my anger faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">into irritation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WAS beginning work again on the notes that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged my attention before Nebo's interruption,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when from out my subconscious memory came a vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that startled me. It was a remembrance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">something Henri Mertaud had said in the last letter he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had written me before his death. As memory of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had written grew clearer in my mind, I rose to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, my thoughts utterly overturned. Then hastening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my file, I began a rapid search in it for Mertaud's</seg><seg type="columnLine">last letter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I found the letter, which Mertaud had written</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me the day before he perished in his laboratory fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ran quickly through it until I found the lines I wanted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I read them through and then, the hazy suspicions in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind now crystallizing swiftly into a dreadful certainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went back and read them again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This afternoon," Mertaud had written toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of his letter, "another crank called on me, one more</seg><seg type="columnLine">original than most of those who bother me.

Was it Nebo and his associates, then, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned and destroyed in Braun's case also? Then Ne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bo's tale of his organization determined to stop space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket research at all costs, was the truth, and no mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">figment of his mind!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed and still seems to me that any group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men must be partly mad who would let their convictions</seg><seg type="columnLine">on such an academic subject carry them to such lengths,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but whatever the truth as to that, it was indisputable that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these men were deliberately using murder when other</seg><seg type="columnLine">means failed to stop all scientific research that might lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">to interplanetary travel!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If this was so, I was in real and imminet danger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nebo and his associates had warned me and I had flout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed their warning.

I found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my mail when I arrived that morning at Manhattan</seg><seg type="columnLine">University for an early final-exam. I was giving. As let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters from uncle were rather infrequent, though our</seg><seg type="columnLine">relations were of the friendliest, I opened and read it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was astounded! My uncle's account of the threats</seg><seg type="columnLine">made against him by this Peter Nebo, whoever he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, and of the strange deaths of the other two space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket experimenters, Braun and Mertaud, was startling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not wonder that uncle feared a like fate at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of Nebo and his group, whatever their motives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when I showed the letter to my superior, Lloyd</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed with me that a real danger threatened Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Melford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was touched by my uncle's half-apologetic request</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I stay with him for a few days. Certainly no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a better right to make such a request, for Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferdinand had taken the place of my dead parents in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my boyhood and youth, had supervised my education</seg><seg type="columnLine">and guided my choice of a career. More a father than</seg><seg type="columnLine">an uncle, in my regard, I did not hesitate a moment in</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranging to have a substitute give my classes their ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aminations for the next few days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before I left the university that morning, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy came.

And Lloyd was</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My dominating emotion was keen grief for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle. I had never realized how much the kindly, elderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist meant to me until I received that telegram.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But before our train reached Philadelphia,' I had set</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside for the time my emotion, and was discussing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lloyd the most important fact--the certainty that Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Melford had been murdered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was clear enough, in view of his letter of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. Nebo and his associates had carried out their</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat and uncle and his laboratory had been destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as had Mertaud and Braun. It seemed incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">that men could live who would commit a string of mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders simply because of their objection to such an ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stract field of science as space-rocket research.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was indisputable that that had been the cause of</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncle's death, though. There remained the question</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to how he had met death while supposedly under</seg><seg type="columnLine">police protection. I meant to investigate that problem,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Lloyd and I debarked at the Broad Street Sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that afternoon, we took a taxi and drove south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward across the city to the suburb in which lies the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philadelphia School of Science. Not far from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">campus the cab turned into the extensive wooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds of the old Melford estate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grounds of the old place looked the same, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their big oaks and beeches and dense, rather unkempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrubbery, as when I had spent my boyhood there. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rambling old frame mansion that had been the home</seg><seg type="columnLine">of several generations of Melfords was reduced to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile of debris in which several policemen and plain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothesmen were searching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the latter came over to Lloyd and me as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">got out of our cab. He was a keen-faced man of mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle age, whose expression had now a certain tenseness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and haggardness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm Captain Crail," he told me. "You'll be young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Melford?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and this is Dr. Jackson," I said.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded. "Have you caught them yet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crail shook his head. "No, we haven't, though we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a net spread for Nebo over this whole end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand that you and four of your men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the place at the time this happened," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Crail nodded, his face unhappy. "We were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that's what makes me feel worst on the thing. Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us here to protect Dr. Melford--and he and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant killed in spite of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I'm not sure that five hundred men around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house would have saved your uncle.

I and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">four men were hiding in the shrubbery right around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house here, and no one could possibly have gotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">within fifty feet of the place without being seen by us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To tell the truth, I didn't really think there was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger threatening your uncle. From your uncle's ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count, I judged this Nebo as just another crank. Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">but cranks would want to stop scientists from monkey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with rockets ? But the thing was too serious to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances on, in view of what your uncle told us about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German and French scientists who had been killed, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were watching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd told Wilkes, one of my men, to go in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen minutes and make sure your uncle was all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not that I had any idea anybody could get through</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to the house, but I just didn't want to take any</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances. From where I was hidden, I could see Wilkes</seg><seg type="columnLine">go in each time, and about two o'clock I saw Barnett</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out and mail the letter your uncle had written to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ARNETT returned in a few minutes and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was quiet. At three o'clock Wilkes went in</seg><seg type="columnLine">as usual on the quarter-hour and he reports your uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was writing in his study, with his dog beside him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barnett was sitting in the hall. Two minutes after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilkes came out, it happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The house simply exploded into flame! I never saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything like it--one minute the house was a big darker</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk in the darkness, and the next it was a single sheet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flame roaring upward as though every particle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place had taken fire at the same instant!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We ran toward it but to enter that roaring furnace</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been suicide. Your uncle and the servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been dead immediately--we never even heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cry from them. We ran around the grounds looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for anyone who might have started it, but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one! Not even a car was in sight, though one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my men, Janney, says he did hear a whirring noise as</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a car speeding away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'The place was burned down to ashes quicker than</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything I ever saw before, even before the firemen got</seg><seg type="columnLine">here.

Well, van Hijnn</seg><seg type="columnLine">died eight years ago, as perhaps you remember.

I suspected nothing, any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than anyone else, until I came across a diary he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left in his bedroom at home. In it, two days be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he died, van Hijnn had recorded how a man named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wladolowski, a strange-looking man with unnaturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">white face and green eyes, had called on him and warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him he must stop his work with space-rockets. Nebo, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, under a different name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Naturally, van Hijnn had refused--and two days</seg><seg type="columnLine">later he was destroyed. That aroused'my suspicions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet try as I might, I could get no further trace of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">so-called Wladolowski. I forgot the occurrence until</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years later, when the Englishman, Fexil Morrow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perished. Morrow was a London author who had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and gone on with van Hijnn's space-rocket experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, because of his intense interest in the possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of traveling to the moon or to some planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Morrow had a Thames-side workshop with a trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">technical assistant and had made a hobby of his space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket models. His workshop, too, puffed into flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">one night--always at night, mark!--and he and his as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistant were burned to death. I read of that and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought nothing of it, had not the newspaper men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned the efforts of the London police to trace an odd-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking, green-eyed man who had had some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">altercation with Morrow the night before the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"At once I remembered the case of van Hijnn. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, then, the man who had had the argument with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morrow, the Wladolowski who had threatened van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hijnn? I went to London to investigate, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that this time the green-eyed man had given his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name as Smart. After leaving Morrow's place, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been seen to join three companions a little along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"This meant that'my Wladolowski or Smart was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">working alone but had associates. How many of them he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, or has, I cannot guess. By that time I was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that Morrow and his assistant were murdered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop them from continuing their space-rocket research,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as van Hijnn had been. This must mean a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of madmen was at large, so strongly infected with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the delusion that space-travel was unholy that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would kill to prevent it from ever being brought about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The next space-rocket experimenter to meet death</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Krasny of Buda-Pesth, eight months later. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a year afterward, two Japanese scientists who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced a scheme for -firing a projectile to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">world from a huge cannon sunk into the earth's crust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were slain in their Tokio laboratory. In both cases,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of Krasny and of Oyumi and Shota, a visit from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a caller easily identifiable as your Nebo or my Wladol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">owski had preceded their deaths, and in both cases the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimenters perished by fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"In the years since then, six more scientists were</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed. Dr. William Hayes, the Australian scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was at work on a new kind of successive-firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket, was next. As usual, his death was by fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though in his case I could not trace any call by Nebo</seg><seg type="columnLine">beforehand. I am sure that such a call took place, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, as these murderers seem punctilious in warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">their victims and giving them a chance to stop their</seg><seg type="columnLine">research.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"After Hayes, followed the death of Serge Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soff, of the Soviet's Moscow laboratories. Wilsoff</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been trying to devise rockets for passenger-traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">over oceans, and had turned to consideration of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">launching of one into space. Quickly came the warning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop such research. Then, when the warning was</seg><seg type="columnLine">disregarded, came death by fire. Very shortly after, L.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molokoff, who took up Wilsoff's work, met the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate. And in the last two years have followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar deaths of Dr. Braun, of Henri Mertaud and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dr. Melford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In each case," von Gersten's eyes were glittering as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he drove home his point--"in each case the murder was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done by firing the laboratory, workshop or home of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist in question. In my opinion that is done so</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man and his work would perish together. In no case</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the method of firing discoverable, but every time it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened during the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Also, in each case, the scientist was given a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop his work.

All of the eleven disre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded this warning, and all have died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I might have been able to save some of them by</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning them, but in no case have I had time. For in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every instance, the warning and the murder took place</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost directly after it had become publicly known that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scientist in question was engaged in space-rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">research. Evidently Nebo and his companions constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">scan scientific journals and newspapers and miss no</seg><seg type="columnLine">such news, and evidently they act at once on learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Von Gersten leaned back, spread his hands. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have the story," he said simply. "Eleven experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menters slain by this Nebo and his band--a remorseless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">relentless group who have determined apparently that</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-travel never shall take place.

"Many times I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have asked myself that question," he admitted. "Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times it seems to me that only the craziest of lunatics</seg><seg type="columnLine">would such murders commit.

"Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you any idea as to how that could be done ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Von Gersten's head bobbed. "I do have an idea, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that brought me to America," he said.

"Their leader, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">named himself Peter Nebo, warned Dr. Melford shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">before his murder to stop such research, and we believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nebo may give you a similar warning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I've already had a warning of that sort--this</seg><seg type="columnLine">very afternoon!" replied Dr. Winn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We jumped to our feet. "You have?" cried Crail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who gave it to you--what happened?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a man who called himself Walter Ennis," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied Dr. Winn, "a short, stocky person."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did he have an unusually pallid face and green eyes ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried Crail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, that describes him exactly.

"He is in most deadly danger!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get out of your laboratory, out of the building!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crail told the scientist on the other end of the wire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"At any moment Nebo's group may carry out their</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat and destroy you as they did Melford and the rest!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I don't understand . . we heard Dr. Winn start</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to say when he broke off suddenly. Then from the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiver in his voice came a high scream that mingled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loud roaring sound. "My God, it's . . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" yelled Crail into the transmitter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's happening?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The receiver was silent as the grave. Crail jabbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hook fiercely as von Gersten and Lloyd and I pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely to him. "Operator!" shouted Crail. "What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter with that line?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know; it just went dead," replied the Detroit</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator's voice. "Just a moment, please, and I'll find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out what's the matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a silence of utter suspense we four waited in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Philadelphia office, our minds all at the Detroit end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wire. It was not one moment but many before</seg><seg type="columnLine">we heard the Detroit operator's voice again, this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your line went dead in a fire!" she reported. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">building of Detroit Scientific College, in which your con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection was, is reported as having burst into flames and</seg><seg type="columnLine">is already half-destroyed, they say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about our party, what about Dr. Winn?" cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Crail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a report that there were only two men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building--a professor and a janitor--and that the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so sudden that neither escaped!" the operator</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered. "If you'll hold the line, I'll get the names for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you . . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Captain Crail set the telephone down on the desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly and turned to us.

But the others, young Melford and Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor von Gersten and Dr. Jackson, having insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was best fitted to do so, I am taking it on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There'll be no more literary polish in it, though, than in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any police report.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'll admit that I was rather knocked off my feet on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night of June 2nd when we four in my office heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the destruction of Dr. Winn and his laboratory in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Detroit College. It had never occurred to me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nebo and his pals might strike again so quickly after</seg><seg type="columnLine">their murder of Dr. Melford, and I felt a certain re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsibility for not having warned Dr. Winn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, I still felt responsible more or less for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder of Dr. Melford. Of course, as Arthur Mel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford had agreed, Nebo's band must have used some un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard-of way to fire Dr. Melford's house, and a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">policemen around it would apparently have done no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than we did, to prevent it. But just the same, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">policeman who is called on for protection, likes to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man he's protecting murdered under his nose, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's what had happened to Dr. Melford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It made me determined to get this lunatic Nebo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever nuts might be trailing with him, if it took!</seg><seg type="columnLine">SPACE-ROCKET MURDERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">591</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me ten years. That began to look like more of a job</seg><seg type="columnLine">when this von Gersten appeared and told us of the num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of space-rocket experimenters and scientists that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nebo's group had killed in the last eight years. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea of nabbing him through Dr. Winn brightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">things up for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The destruction of Dr. Winn, that took place literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">within our hearing, though he was in Detroit and we in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philadelphia, blasted our hopes in that direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The first news given us by the Detroit operator was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon supplemented by the Detroit police.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> According to them, the building at Detroit Scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">College, in which Dr. Winn was, had simply puffed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame from top to bottom. Winn and the other man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, the janitor, had no chance to escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">No cars had been seen leaving the place during or</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the fire, and no one had reported seeing a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the description of Peter Nebo. The Detroit police</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised to get a dragnet out for him at my request,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I had small hopes of their success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When I finished talking to them, I looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. Young Melford and Dr. Jackson were rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">white but Professor von Gersten seemed more keenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointed than shaken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Gone--the chance to catch that demon!" he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "Had Dr. Winn known sooner, he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had men there to seize Nebo when he visited him this</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There's no use going over what might have been," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him. "The thing to do is to get on the trail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nebo and the rest before they spring any more of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">murders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Von Gersten shook his head. "My friend, there will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no more murders in the immediate future," he as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured me. "For the simple reason that Melford and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winn were the only outstanding space-rocket experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menters, and that until new experimenters take up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problems of interplanetary travel and attract the atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of these madmen, they will have no cause to act.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But when we next hear of such scientists taking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-rocket research, we will not delay. We will sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">round them with men who can seize whichever of Nebo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">group appears to warn them. And once we have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, if only one, we can search out the others."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Then that's what you're going to do--wait until</seg><seg type="columnLine">other scientists take up space-rocket work and use</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to trap Nebo?" Arthur Melford asked. Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gersten nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">; "It is all that can be done. It may mean a long wait,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but sooner or later the chance will come, and then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will maybe end once and for all this organization of mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I stared at the three of them. "Say, you three may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be swell scientists, but I'll say you'd make poor cops!" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "To talk about waiting, maybe for years, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other scientists take up the rocket-research!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What else is there to do?" Arthur Melford asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Do?" I repeated. "Didn't you ever hear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle art of framing? Don't you suppose that Nebo</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his fellow-nuts can be framed as well as any gang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster or gunman?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Frame Nebo?" said Melford. His face lit up. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I see what you mean! You mean to get some</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist to give out that he is seriously engaged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-rocket experiments, and that that will . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Will come to the attention of Nebo and his asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciates and they'll think it's straight," I finished for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And when they call on the scientist in question to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">him their usual polite Warning about stopping his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periments, before bumping him off, they'll run into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch of hidden men they won't have a chance in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world to get away from!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is superb!" cried von Gersten. "Captain Crail, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">congratulate you--this will mean their capture!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, save the congratulations until we're in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear," I told him. "The first thing to do is to fix it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up for some scientist to publish a lot of stuff about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">important space-rocket experiments. It ought to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scientist of first-class standing, too, so that Nebo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gang won't suspect camouflage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll find it rather hard to get a scientist of stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to put out such a story," predicted Dr. Jackson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Scientists are so jealous of their scientific reputations</seg><seg type="columnLine">that most of them would refuse to take a chance of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pairing their standing by issuing untrue statements."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I grinned at him. "I know that, but I know one</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist of first-rate standing who'll do it, I think. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">name's Dr. Lloyd Jackson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I?" said Jackson startedly. "You want me to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounce I've been experimenting with space-rockets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I do," I said. "You've got enough scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">position to make Nebo'9 group believe your statements.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll cotoe to warn you before trying anything--they</seg><seg type="columnLine">always have--and as I said, we'll be ready night and day</seg><seg type="columnLine">to grab them when they come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Jackson reflected for a moment. "All right, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it," he answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks, Lloyd," said Arthur Melford gratefully. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be there to take any chances you have to take."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We all will," I agreed. "Now, what statements are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you going to issue ? They ought to be strong enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make Nebo and the rest sure to come, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you will permit a suggestion," said von Gersten</seg><seg type="columnLine">keenly, "why not say that you have developed a method</seg><seg type="columnLine">of producing atomic power, immense power from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled disintegration of atoms, and that you intend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">use it first in a space-rocket to reach the nearer planets ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ARTHUR MELFORD nodded quickly. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring Nebo and the rest, if anything would!</seg><seg type="columnLine">For that would mean, if it were true, an immense sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">entific step forward in the possibility of interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Jackson made a wry face. "It'll mean my scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific reputation going to shreds, too, when I announce</seg><seg type="columnLine">it," he said. "Atomic power! But I'm with you on it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good!" I said. "Now I suggest that you return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York immediately, Dr. Jackson, and about two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days from now make that announcement to the news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers. It ought to get publicity enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll be up there with you from the time you an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounce that, on. In the meantime, I'll arrange to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave here and to take a couple of my own men with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and Mr. Melford can carry out his uncle's funeral</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremonies, as I suppose he wants to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe all of us, including Professor von Gersten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be careful not to be seen with you after the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncements are made, lest Nebo and his pals become</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious. So we'll join you just before you give out</seg><seg type="columnLine">your statements and stay with you, hidden, until Nebo</seg><seg type="columnLine">shows up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have some sort of private laboratory at Man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hattan University, I suppose?"

"Yes, a fair-sized one on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top-floor of the Building of Physical Science."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you can, in your statements, let drop the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that your model space-rockets and atomic power formulae</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all that are in your private laboratory, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're working there night and day. In that way Nebo</seg><seg type="columnLine">will know where to find you. And the rest of us can lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden there and when he shows up we'll grab him, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have to kill him to do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These were the arrangements which, after a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more discussion, we adopted. Dr. Jackson returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Von Gersten and Arthur Melford remained in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philadelphia with me and on the next day, June 3rd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was held the funeral of the remains of Dr. Melford and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his servant. Both von Gersten and I attended with</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Melford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the morning of the 4th we three left for New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, with us being three of my men, Wilkes, Janney</seg><seg type="columnLine">and McCloskey. The chief had allowed them and me</seg><seg type="columnLine">indefinite leave for the time the case required. No doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the New York police would have cooperated to the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent of furnishing a couple of men, but to ask them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant giving out the whole story of what was still, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspapers, only a couple of accidental fires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We reached New York before noon and went straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to Manhattan University, on the northern heights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the island. The big place had rather a deserted look</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the regular school-year was ended and summer-school</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not yet begun.	^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Young Melford led us to the Building of Physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">Science, a big square gray-stone building at the campus'</seg><seg type="columnLine">western edge. We went in and up to the private labor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atory of Dr. Jackson, where he was awaiting us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a small office at one end of the laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was there that we meant to watch and wait, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifts, after the announcements were made, for the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of Nebo's group. Jackson had placed a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cots and some tinned foods in this office, as our</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait might extend for days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After I had pronounced it all satisfactory, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had settled down in the office, Dr. Jackson telephoned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four leading New York newspapers and said he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">some important news to give out. They appreciated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson's standing and promised to send out reporters</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once. In fact, four reporters and a photographer ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared in less than an hour. Dr. Jackson received them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the laboratory, but we had opened the office-door a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack and could see from our hiding-place in the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he gave out his statement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was afraid that Dr. Jackson's natural repugnance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to giving out untrue statements might make him play his</seg><seg type="columnLine">part badly but he rose to the occasion. In an impressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he told them that he had solved the secret of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing power from the disintegration of atoms, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he meant to use this atomic power in a new-design</seg><seg type="columnLine">of space-rocket that he was going to build.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reporters were much excited. "Could you give</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of demonstration, Dr. Jackson?" one pleaded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is going to create a great sensation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I fully intend to give a demonstration of my dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery," Jackson told them, "but to demonstrate this</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic power on other than a minute scale, I will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to arrange a field-laboratory in some less thickly-inhab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ited region than this. The forces released by this process</seg><seg type="columnLine">are too powerful to take chances with."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, doctor, why are you applying your discovery</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to the construction of space-rockets, instead of to more</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary purposes?" asked another. "Atomic power</seg><seg type="columnLine">will revolutionize the world if it is applied to industry."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know that," said Dr. Jackson seriously, "but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">consider the space-rocket question, the possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing about travel to other worlds, of the greatest im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance. I mean to use this atomic power I have de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped in this way first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were other questions from the reporters, shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Jackson so rapidly that he could hardly answer them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He promised a demonstration of the atomic power</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a few weeks--as soon as he had devised an easier-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cantrolled apparatus. He also told them that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">working every day and most of the night at the task of</seg><seg type="columnLine">designing an atomic-powered space-rocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They left, obviously anxious to return with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories, and Jackson came back to the office where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hidden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You heard that bunch of pseudo-science I handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them?" he said. "At least it ought to make a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper-story."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arthur Melford laughed. "It will, Lloyd. I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear now some of the comments your scientific con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">freres will be making when they read of your wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful discovery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I know about what they'll call me," said Jackson</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruefully. "But you think it'll bring Nebo?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It certainly should," declared von Gersten. "If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted down those other scientists simply because they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were experimenting with space-rockets, they will cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly come here when they hear you have discovered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of atomic power to use in such a rocket."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll come," I agreed, "and when they do come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've got to be ready.

When Nebo and his pals do show up, they won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE began then a strange wait. I decided that</seg><seg type="columnLine">four of us, in two shifts of two, were enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait in the office off the laboratory, and so I had two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men, Janney and McCloskey, post themselves at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front and rear entrances, respectively, of the building's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground floor. To the caretaker in charge of the unused</seg><seg type="columnLine">building, Jackson explained that these were men he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hired to protect him from curiosity-seekers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' The other four of us, von Gersten, Arthur Melford,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilkes and I, remained in the little office.

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">read the articles that night, Jackson having had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caretaker bring in copies of all the papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Jackson's statement, sensational enough by ltselfe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was made even more sensational by the newspapers'</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatment. They enlarged on what his discovery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic power would mean, if it proved to be all he stated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Electricity and steam a3 sources of power would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrapped, a handful of coal could run a steamship around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world, and the like. And even more wonderful, Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson meant to use atomic power first in launching a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket into space toward other worlds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The writers here drew highly imaginative pictures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson's atomic rocket touring the worlds of the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">SPACE-ROCKET MURDERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">593</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">system, of possible inhabitants on such planets as Mare</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Venus, of a future line of atomic rockets plying be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the various planets and earth, it being presumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that terrestrial colonies would soon be established on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets that proved habitable. All this would result from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Jackson's discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scientists, who had been asked for their com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, were of different opinions. Some said it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite possible that Dr. Jackson had devised a way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtaining atomic power but that the idea of making its</seg><seg type="columnLine">first use the actuating of a space-rocket was unsound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Others stated outright that they did not believe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alleged discovery. Most of those who were asked rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedged on the question. Generally, though, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an air of disbelief among the savants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the public, or at least a great portion of it, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to believe. For there began that very night an influx</seg><seg type="columnLine">of curiosity-seekers, cranks, reporters and inventors, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasted for the next four days. They streamed up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory to question and bother Dr. Jackson, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had perforce to let them all be admitted, since we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not tell when among them might come Nebo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his associates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In those four days we continued the most monot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onous of existences, two of us in the little office keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch on the laboratory and Jackson while the other two</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept It was not so monotonous for Jackson himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because, confined by our plot to the laboratory, he occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied himself in work of his own, that I suppose his</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors thought was part of the space-rocket and atomic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">power researches. In those four days he did not leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the fifth day, his stream of visitors had slackened</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good deal, for the first sensation caused by Jackson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">statements had by then faded out a little. We remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly on the watch. It was my belief that by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time Nebo's group would certainly have read of Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson's wide-heralded discovery and plans, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would not delay long in putting in an appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the evening of the fifth day, we ate together a</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat sketchy dinner, and then Dr. Jackson went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the laboratory to continue his work, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">von Gersten and I kept watch. It was Wilkes' and</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Mel ford's turn to sleep. Von Gersten and I sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">close together, near the crack of the just-opened door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">within full view of the brightly-lit laboratory, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson pottered with his flames and test-tubes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a little bit before midnight that there sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">a knock at the laboratory's outer door. Jackson went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to open it and I saw two men step quickly inside. Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately I sensed that these were not ordinary visitors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for they had not been announced by the caretaker in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge below. And as they stepped into the lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory's full illumination, I saw that the end of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait was at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The foremost of the two men was Peter Nebo! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed but one glance at his squat figure, dressed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-quality dark suit, his dose-cut black hair, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally dead-white face and hands and green eyes, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">identify him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And his companion might have been his twin brother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this other man also was stocky, dark-haired, white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced and green-eyed! I rose to my feet, eyeing Nebo</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely through the crack in the door, and with my gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in my hand. Von Gersten too had seen, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes gleaming behind his glasses had risen, gun in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw that Dr. Jackson also recognized his callers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but he betrayed no sign of any prior knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are Dr. Lloyd Jackson?" asked Peter Nebo</seg><seg type="columnLine">politely. "My name is Clark and I and my brother wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see Dr. Jackson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jackson nodded. "What is it you want, gentlemen?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked calmly. "I am Dr. Jackson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We wished to learn, Dr. Jackson," said Nebo, "if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is true as the newspapers stated, that you have dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered a method of producing practical atomic power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and intend to utilize it to propel a space-rocket?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, the newspaper accounts were substantially cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rect," Jackson told him. "I have been successful in</seg><seg type="columnLine">developing such power and mean to use it first in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the next moment, things happened with bewilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rapidity. I had been ready to burst out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory with von Gersten and confront and capture</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nebo and his companion. I had fully expected that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go on to warn Dr. Jackson that he must halt his</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-rocket research, as he had done in the other cases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead, Peter Nebo uttered a quick cry in some un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known tongue, and at the same moment he and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion grasped Dr. Jackson and hastened with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the laboratory door! They were abducting Jackson</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of warning him I</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly von Gersten and I burst out, and I shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly at Nebo's companion. He dropped with a gut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tural cry, but as he did so, a half-dozen squat, white-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">men rushed into the laboratory from the hall in answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Nebo's shout!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four of them grasped Jackson, and with Nebo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged him out of the laboratory, while the other two</seg><seg type="columnLine">delayed a moment to aim flat metal rods in their hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward us. From the rods sprang thin jets of clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid, and though these jets missed von Gersten and me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they struck against the laboratory's wall, the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst suddenly into flame!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the two ran out, von Gersten and I shot, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed them in the smoke and flame pouring from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory's wall. I heard the tread of running feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascending the hall stairs that led to the roof! Wilkes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Arthur Melford burst from the office, awakened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the uproar, pistols in their hands, and Janney and Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Closkey came running up from below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "McCloskey--Janney--get an extinguisher and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fire out before it spreads!" I yelled. "The rest come</seg><seg type="columnLine">on with me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IRAN into the hall and up the stairs, Melford and</seg><seg type="columnLine">von Gersten beside me and Wilkes following.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's happened?" young Melford was shouting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nebo and his gang--they took Jackson up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof!"	- -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we raced up the stairs, we heard a whirring sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly dying away above. We burst out on the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even in the darkness it took but an instant to see it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was empty 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arthur Melford yelled and pointed westward. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the glow of the lights along the Hudson, we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily a slim speeding shape of gleaming silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">that vanished even as we saw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They've got away with Lloyd!" Melford cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They had a plane on this roof and have escaped in it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A plane?" I exclaimed. "Then that's how they got</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the building, coming down from the roof! But how</seg><seg type="columnLine">did they ever land and take off a plane on this small</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">594</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God knows, but they did it somehow!" Melford said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McCloskey and Janney emerged on the roof, grimy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and panting. "We got the fire out," they reported.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did they get away with Dr. Jackson ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They did," I said. "But why did they carry Jackson</seg><seg type="columnLine">away instead of warning him to stop research, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did all the other scientists? Has Nebo taken him off to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill him ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I think not!" von Gersten interposed. "Tell me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you saw that companion of Nebo's you killed, and those</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-dozen others Nebo called to his aid? You saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they looked alike?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They all looked like Nebo himself, if that's what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean," I told him. "Squat, white-faced, green-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but what about it ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think it means much, that," von Gersten declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think it may explain all this mystery that for eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">years has puzzled me. Quick, we will go down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">examine that one you shot and whose body they left</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it dropped."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We went back to the laboratory, which was badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned but was no longer burning. The body of Nebo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion lay by the door where it had fallen and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">all knelt beside it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seen so closely, the man was very strange-looking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His green eyes stared up sightlessly at the ceiling, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">round hole above one eye showing where my bullet had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. His face and hands retained their unnatural dead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiteness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Von Gersten rummaged in the pockets of the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing. He drew out several objects we inspected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of them was a flat metal rod with a trigger-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch at one end, plainly one of the weapons that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased the jets of liquid, which had fired what matter they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had touched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another object we turned over and over was an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricate little cylindrical mechanism of wires and dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phragms none of us could fathom. The other thing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's pockets was an oblong silvery metal plate</seg><seg type="columnLine">several inches long, on whose surface was engraved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">black an accurate Mercator's projection of the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Superimposed on this map were a number of curving</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines that glowed with light as though marked by raditun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paint. These lines all radiated from a single point in</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern Labrador, to some ten or twelve points dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributed over the earth's surface. Along each line was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inscription in characters absolutely unfamiliar in ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance to all of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does this earth-map mean?" I asked. "Can</seg><seg type="columnLine">you make anything of it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can make something of it, yes," von Gersten said in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tone of repressed excitement. "But I make more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this man himself than of what he carried in his pockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">--see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We all gasped. Von Gersten had grasped the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's close-cut black hair and had suddenly pulled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole mass of it off! The black hair was a wig, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">removal disclosed a moist-looking green-skinned head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And this bulbous green head was soft, von Gersten's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing thumb sinking into it an inch!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our bewilderment and horror deepened when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German pulled off the dead man's clothing and we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all his body except his face and hands was covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with moist green skin also. Closer examination showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the whiteness of the face and hands was due to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat of white skin-paint having been applied to them, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">when a little of this was scraped away, the green skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed beneath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This green-skinned body was quite inhuman in gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral characteristics. There seemed no skeleton in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all, it having been supported instead by immensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick-grouped muscles. The legs and arms, in fact, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more nor less than great tentacles that tapered</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at their extremities to semi-human fingers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">toes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With hands that trembled a little, von Gersten pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that the ears were quite different in inner-structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">from anything human and that the teeth in the mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">were artificial ones, apparently inserted to allow the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">production of human speech-tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have no doubt," von Gersten said, "that dissection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this body will reveal that it is entirely boneless, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the circulatory, digestive and nervous systems</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be found radically different from the human."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood up, the metal world-map with its glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines in his hand. We rose unsteadily also. "But then</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is this--this thing?" I asked shakenly. "It's not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only like nothing human, it's like nothing ever known</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Earth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right there, Captain Crail," von Gersten</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, almost calmly. "Although it seems to have de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped a near-human form, the species to which this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing belongs, cannot have developed under terrestrial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean that this thing and the rest, that Nebo</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the others are . . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean that Nebo and his associates cannot be crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of Earth at all.

But I did know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was facing Peter Nebo and one of his associates.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The descriptions left no doubt--this squat man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">black hair, unnaturally white face and green eyes could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no other than the ring-leader of the group that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed a dozen space-rocket experimenters. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so much the same in appearance, that I accepted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nebo's ready explanation that it was his brother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I admitted, in answer to their first question,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had discovered a source of atomic power and</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to use it in a space-rocket, I fully expected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear Nebo warn me to stop such research, as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned Dr. Melford and all the others. I knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Crail and Professor von Gersten must be watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the office at the laboratory's end, and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nebo finished his warning, they and the others would</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst out and seize the two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But to my utter surprise, no sooner had I made that</seg><seg type="columnLine">SPACE-ROCKET MURDERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">595</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">admission, than Nebo and the other had grasped me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rushing with me toward the door. I heard a cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Captain Crail and a shot, and Nebo's companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosed me and sank to the floor. But Nebo continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold me with a strength that even then seemed to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">superhuman, and in answer to his shout, a half-dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures like him poured in from the hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four of these grasped me also and I was lifted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried out of the laboratory with a swiftness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength I could not resist. I heard cries from Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crail and von Gersten, and heard too the sudden crackle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flames as I was borne up the stairs toward the roof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With Nebo urging his followers to greater swiftness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep cries in an unknown language, we burst out onto</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the darkness, I was just able to see that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being borne toward a long, torpedo-like metal craft that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on the roof. I kicked and struggled, but was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a child in the hand of my captors. They hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to a round open door in the metal hull's side, leapt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with me, and then as the last two to reach the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang in, there was a whirring sound from the craft's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom and stern, and through a small window in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door I saw the roof dropping away, as we darted into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nebo uttered a brief command and those holding me</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly released me. I looked dazedly around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The interior of the craft was undivided, so that I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the center of a sort of hollow metal submarine forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet long.

With a creeping of the skin, I now</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that all of them were replicas of Nebo in</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance, green-eyed, white-skinned, black-haired and</seg><seg type="columnLine">squat-bodied. All were watching me incuriously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two other men, exactly like the rest, sat in the nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the craft at a control-board covered with rods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">small wheels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I became aware that Peter Nebo was speaking. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke briefly in an unknown language to the men about</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. At his orders all but two of them went to other</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of the craft; those two holding flat metal rods that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were obviously weapons of some nature, remaining to</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nebo then spoke to me in English. "Do not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmed, Dr. Jackson," he said to me calmly. "We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no intention whatever of harming you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why have you kidnaped me?" I asked, rather un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily. "Who are you--where are you taking me?'*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To answer those questions may take rather more time</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you think," he said. "I will content myself for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present by saying that we have seized you in this fashion</seg><seg type="columnLine">for weighty reasons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was beginning to recover a little from my dazedness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The same reasons that induced you to kill a dozen other</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists, I suppose?" I shot at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a little surprise in the green eyes. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that we killed them ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I know that you've murdered a dozen space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket experimenters from van Hijnn to Melford. Why</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have you killed all these experimenters so ruthlessly?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nebo considered me for a minute with an unfathom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able expression. "These things I will explain to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly, Dr. Jackson," he said. "In the meantime, be</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured that no harm will come to you from us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned from me and went to the nose of the craft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw him speak to the two men at the controls, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they shifted rods and turned wheels and I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the racing craft turn sharply in mid-air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I half-raised myself to look through the little window</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside me. Far, far below in the darkness, I made out</seg><seg type="columnLine">two little beds of lights that I knew must be cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They sped backward so quickly that I knew the craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">was traveling at incredible speed, though the only sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the ceaseless whirring of its operation and a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">whine of winds outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking upward at the stars, I soon discovered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were traveling almost due north. It was evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the craft had first flown westward and then, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">having left New York well behind, had now changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">course and headed north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I LOOKED about in an effort to discover the source</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this strange craft's power. Ranged along its walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were big cylindrical tanks, and from these, heavy tubing</seg><seg type="columnLine">or piping ran to the nose and stern of the craft and also</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its floor. From the tubes that ran to the stern and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor came the soft whirring. It was evidently these</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in some way were hurling the torpedo-like hull</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air. There were connections between all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tubes and the control-board in the nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I also made out some smaller square tanks connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to metal nozzles that were mounted just inside the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows like so many machine-guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nebo came back from the craft's nose and saw me</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring about. "You are wondering how this flier oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ates?" he asked. "Those cylindrical tanks hold certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive gases compressed thousands of times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These gases are released through those tubes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings outside the flier's hull, being fired at the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment they are released. Their firing-recoil is of tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous force, and the firing of the bottom or floor-tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">raises and suspends the flier in air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Firing of the stern-tubes propels us forward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">similarly the nose-tubes can be used for braking pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded. It was in my mind to learn from Nebo</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as possible concerning this whole business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about those other tanks and nozzles ?" I asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing to the square tanks with their gun-mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">nozzles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those," Nebo explained, "are tanks of liquid so</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemically compounded that almost any kind of non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic matter it touches bursts into flame. We use it</seg><seg type="columnLine">by projecting it from those nozzles, and also have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small hand-rod containers of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Light broke in upon me with his words. "Then that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">how you fired the laboratory-building of Dr. Winn, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Melford's house and all the rest!" I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, we simply brought the flier, on a dark night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the building we wanted to destroy. Hovering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little above it in the darkness, we had only to turn a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few streams of the firing-liquid down on the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">below and instantly it went up in flames."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that's how you did it!" I repeated. "I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an airplane, but an airplane couldn't have hovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">596</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and would have been heard, so . . . ." Here I broke off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I continued. "But why did you do it?" I demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why kill those dozen scientists and why carry me</seg><seg type="columnLine">away ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dr. Jackson, every one of those scientists we de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed was working on experiments that might help to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring about interplanetary travel," said Peter Nebo</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We destroyed them, after they refused to stop their</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, because we are utterly opposed to such travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking place. We will never, while we can prevent it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit the development of space-rockets or anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">else that will allow men to journey to other planets."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But what's your reason for being so dead set against</seg><seg type="columnLine">men reaching other planets?" I exclaimed. "We thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were madmen, with a delusion on the subject, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">madmen couldn't have designed this flier and these other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. You must have some reason."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have a reason, Dr. Jackson," answered Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nebo gravely. "And that reason is that we ourselves are</seg><seg type="columnLine">from another planet and that our race is determined that</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of Earth shall never invade our world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stared at him. For a moment, my first reaction to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his astounding statement was that after all these men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all mad. But the very craft in which I was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled smoothly through the upper night, the very un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiarity of all the things about me, beat down this</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea and supported, incredible as it was, Nebo's assertion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know that it will be hard for you to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and believe," Nebo was going on, "but it is quite true.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I and all my companions are natives of the planet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you call Venus."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean to tell me, then, that you came to earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Venus?" I said hoarsely. "In this flier?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not in this flier," Peter Nebo corrected. "This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">but one of the craft we use on Venus and which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought, with several others, for use here on earth."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The ship that brought us here from our world is</seg><seg type="columnLine">many times the size of this one and quite different,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it operates on the same principle of gas-firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">recoil as this little flier."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's unbelievable!" I said unsteadily. "You can't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">from another world--you, men like myself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are not men like yourself, Dr. Jackson," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nebo quietly. "We are not men at all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, and be assured for yourself," he added, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning, gave a brief command to one of the men guard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At once the fellow reached up and to my surprise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror jerked off his close black hair in one mass, a wig</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact, and disclosed a green-skinned soft head like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of a seal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He quickly then doffed his clothing. I cannot express</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horror that was mine, when I saw that his body also</seg><seg type="columnLine">was green-skinned and seal-like, a soft boneless trunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which branched arms and legs that were in effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge feelers or tentacles like those of an octopus, instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ordinary human limbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw then that the face and hands were white-painted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accounting for their unchanging dead-whiteness. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">also that the only parts of this grotesque and unhuman</seg><seg type="columnLine">body that looked human at all were the hands and fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face with its nose and mouth and ears, and the eyes--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parts of the body covered by ordinary clothing being</seg><seg type="columnLine">totally different from the human.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The thing reassumed its clothing at Nebo's order.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaken, sick, I stared at Nebo himself. "Then all of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you are like--like that--" I struggled with the words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I am the same and so are all these others," Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nebo answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God, creatures wholly inhuman!" I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But creatures which, I think you will have to admit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal and surpass you humans in intelligence," Nebo</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me calmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you passed as humans--you talk our lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guages--" I said, unable still to understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We did, because it was necessary to fulfill our work</seg><seg type="columnLine">here on your world," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what is your work? The killing of scientist's</seg><seg type="columnLine">here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our work," Peter Nebo said gravely, "is the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention of any scientific research on the part of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans which might lead to your attaining power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit our world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is why we have killed the space-rocket inventors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other experimenters and that is why we have carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">you off like this, Dr. Jackson. To understand fully our</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive, you must understand something of our history."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice was very serious and thoughtful, and as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale geen eyes looked calmly into mine and his deep voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked, I could not realize that this was a non-human</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature of another world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS he spoke, I sat half-crouching on the floor, listen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with a terrible tenseness. The whirring of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing tubes never stopped as the flier drove unceasingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward through the upper night. Except for Nebo</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my two guards, the others in the craft were on watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">at either the controls or mechanisms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our world, the world that you have named Venus,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Peter Nebo (I could still think of him only by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human name), "is a world very much unlike yours in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some respects. It is of much the same size as your</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth and like it, has a day of about twenty-four earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Also, like Earth, Venus has an atmosphere with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vital substances of carbon dioxide and oxygen present</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it, though in somewhat different proportions. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of our world differs very much from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of this one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Venus has no moon. At first that fact may not seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">important to you, but it has made a great difference be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the two worlds. When earth was semi-molten, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung off a great mass of its matter that became its moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That caused irregularities of height in the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, so that when its seas formed, they ran into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper basins and formed oceans, while the higher areas</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed continents of dry land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On Venus, on the contrary, no moon having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung forth, there have never been such irregularities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">level. For that reason, when our seas condensed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the primeval hydrosphere of our planet, they covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost the whole planet, a few small islands alone re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining uncovered. Thus, our world is predominantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a watery world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because of that, evolution on Venus has followed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat different course than on Earth. Here life</seg><seg type="columnLine">originated in the seas and there developed its first crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms. But very soon in its history, life moved to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, where it began the development of a multiplicity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of land-forms. After ages of such land-development,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one class of the vertebrates, the mammals, proved most</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful, and after still more ages of variation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">selection, one species of those mammals, man, developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">SPACE-ROCKET MURDERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">597</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the real intelligence, which has made wonderful progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But on Venus, the story of evolution was entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">different. There the great part of the history of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">was enacted in the waters and only comparatively late</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its history was the land invaded by any life. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">there the land-masses were small and unpromising, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seas were endless and bountiful. In our world, life</seg><seg type="columnLine">had developed to a comparatively high level and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced a species of creatures of some intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">before any living thing ventured on the land. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">species of which I speak was ancestral to my own species.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back in those times of our earliest development in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venerian seas, there was little vertebrate development,</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions being different than those of your terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas. The chief development in so far as intelligence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity were concerned was among a class of creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">akin to the cephalopods, the octopods and squid of Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These creatures were four-armed, capable of quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion through the waters and had considerable enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise and strength. They advanced rapidly in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things until they dominated the seas and outmastered all</seg><seg type="columnLine">competing creatures. Their instincts widened into con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness and intelligence, dim at first but slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They were water-breathing creatures, special organs</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their bodies extracting the dissolved air from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters, but they were able also to live for some time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air and to breathe air. Their ability to breathe air</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon enabled them to spend all their time on the land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They consciously desired to invade the land and gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did. It was a deliberate conquest of land much dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent from the instinctive invasion of land made long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago by your ancestral forms of life on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Once on land, the capabilities of these creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly expanded. They learned to walk on two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tentacle-limbs and to use the other two as arms for</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulation purposes, carrying their heads or brain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases erect above their bodies. They quickly learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of tools and built structures, dwellings--a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gress that would have been impossible had they remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Soon their numbers crowded the islands that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only land of Venus, and their structures had so in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased as to form cities. They had designed vehicles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mechanisms by then, and weapons, and their scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific knowledge grew continually as the scientific spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">took hold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two thousand years ago, while humans were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly barbaric and knew nothing of science, our race</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached a fairly civilized state. We were slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming conscious of the real scheme of the universe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the admirability of truth. We were, and have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever since, just a little ahead of you in scientific progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our speculations as to what lay outside the unchang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cloud-screen that is our planet's sky, were unending.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last, eight hundred years ago, we developed an astron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">omical science which made it possible for us to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the cloud-screen by using telescopic and photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphic instruments sensitive to infra-red rays that can</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass through the clouds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is how we came to see the sun and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds of the solar system and the stars. Gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">there arose a desire among us to visit the nearer of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other worlds. The planet nearer the sun than us, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you call Mercury, was plainly uninhabitable. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next one, Earth, looked habitable to us and much we</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired to visit it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So began experiments in space travel that continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long time. Innumerable projectiles and rockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">were designed and launched, but none were successful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last, two hundred years ago, a ship, designed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket-recoil principle, proved workable. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus and Earth were in inferior conjunction, that ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">made its first successful trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That first Venerian ship reached earth in what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would call the first part of the eighteenth century.

For they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that Earth held a race of intelligence and knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of science almost as great as the Venerians', and a race</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose millions far outnumbered ours. They saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this race of man had devised the most destructive wea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pons of which their science was capable and that with</seg><seg type="columnLine">these weapons they fought unceasingly among them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, striving to subdue each other and slaying each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other in hosts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This was enough to give the Venerian explorers</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause.

The events that had snatched me</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my New York laboratory and presently would</seg><seg type="columnLine">transport me across a great gulf of space to another world</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed incredible, impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking now and again from the window, I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">only darkness beneath, and from this absence of lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">I judged that the flier was already hurtling over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparsely-inhabited wastes of northern Quebec toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eastern Labrador. Also, the stars were paling eastward</seg><seg type="columnLine">to announce the imminence of dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the sickly gray light of day began to appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the east, it dimly disclosed a barren, treeless, gray plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">far below. Over these steppes that were wholly without</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of human beings, the flier was moving at dizzying</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even as the day grew, the flier was beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slacken speed and to decrease its altitude.

As the flier rushed on and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down toward it, I saw that it was a circular embankment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of earth, perhaps fifty feet high and a thousand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside it, was a row of neat metal buildings of no</seg><seg type="columnLine">great size, except for three or four that looked like store-</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This row of buildings was at one side of the circle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the other was a huge and curious structure. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a metal framework built up from massive girders, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like an amphitheatre or hollow hemisphere in shape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though made to receive a huge ball. It was at least two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet across.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flier headed down toward the row of buildings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw two other fliers resting on the ground beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses, and a number of figures running out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings as we descended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our craft slanted down, hovered motionless a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards over the ground whirring softly, then sank ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically until it rested on the earth. At once one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venerians threw open the door, and a wave of cooler</seg><seg type="columnLine">air poured in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nebo spoke to my two Venerian guards and then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. "Please go with us without making trouble, Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson. It will be better for you if you do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HERE are you going to take me?" I asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just to one of the buildings where we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">confine you until the relief-ship comes," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, then," I answered, after a moment's hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stepped out of the flier to the ground. Around me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides Nebo and my two guards, crowded a score or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of figures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were Venerians like those I had already seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disguised like Nebo and the others by human-clothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitened hands and faces and the black wigs.

"We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no food such as you humans consume, but I think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can shift with ours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When, exactly, do you expect your ship from Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come ?" I asked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It should be here day after tomorrow if. all has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">well with it," he said. "You will know as soon as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrives, for always it stays just long enough to disembark</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venerians it brings and take on those returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Venus.

"Not to another world, when I've told you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I have no process of producing the atomic power ?'*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Venerian's strange face was expressionless. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no choice in the matter," he said. "I have my duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my race and my world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that, he left me. I inspected the interior of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison for some time in the hope that there might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">some method of escape from it, but soon found there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was none.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within a half-hour the door opened and I was handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shallow metal platter of dark red mushy substance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a metal bottle or flask of liquid, which proved to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure water. I ate a little of the mushy Venerian food</seg><seg type="columnLine">but found a certain repellent fishy quality in its taste and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave it up. Certainly, I told myself, if that were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">my food in the future, I would be poorly off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the food was handed in, I saw two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venerians standing guard at the door with the fire-fluid</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods.

I asked myself. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">voyage in it as a prisoner to another world, a captivity</seg><seg type="columnLine">without hope of release in the island-cities of the watery</seg><seg type="columnLine">world of Venus?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captivity--and maybe torture or death! For it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident that Nebo and the other Venerians fully believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my published statements and were convinced that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">In my possession the knowledge of a method to produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">limitless atomic power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once on Venus, their scientists would certainly en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavor by all means to wring that supposed secret from</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. The murders of space-rocket experimenters, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had systematically committed on earth to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans attaining interplanetary travel, proved that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not balk at extreme measures to make me tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the secret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had no secret to tell them, but they would never be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve that. They might use the most refined scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortures to make me talk. I cursed the inspiration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Crail that was responsible for my issuing those</seg><seg type="columnLine">statements. Crail and von Gersten and Artie Melford,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would they or anyone ever know what had happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually I became aware that I was very tired, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching out on the floor of my prison, I slept. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I awoke it was with a sensation of cold, and through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door-cracks I now saw that it was night outside. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had slept through twenty-four hours or more in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">weariness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next hours passed without incident. I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brought more of the food in the morning, and this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ate more, for I was extremely hungry. I looked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nebo to appear again but he did not. With the food</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time, though, was brought a sleeping-rug.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard Venerians pass outside now and then and once</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whirr of a flier that went and returned in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. I slept fitfully, my dreams dominated by my</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge that the next twenty-four hours were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">my last on earth if the relief-ship came as expected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I woke again and my food was brought, Nebo</seg><seg type="columnLine">came too, eyeing me thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, we have seen no sign yet of the ship," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">in answer to my first question. "But it should be here</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometime soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When it does come, and we take you to put you</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard it with us, I warn you not to make any struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">or effort to escape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had been my resolve to make a last-minute attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break free, but I did not say so. "Why not?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because in that case we will have to use force,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nebo answered. "We will take no chance of killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, of course, but rather than let you delay us, we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">stun you. You will avoid this unpleasant experience by</seg><seg type="columnLine">being reasonable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said nothing and he went out. I heard him speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Venerians guarding my door as he closed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In indescribable tenseness I sat waiting for the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitable moment. Hour after hour passed, morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave way to noon, and noon to afternoon. By sunset</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to wonder if the ship would come at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost as I wondered I heard a throaty cry from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Venerians outside, repeated instantly by a score</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. I sprang to my feet, trembling. I seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear a faint sound like distant, steady throbbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could hear the Venerians running about outside my</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison. Suddenly the door was flung open and Nebo</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, four armed Venerians with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The ship is arriving!" he told me hastily. "Remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">my warning, Dr. Jackson. Come with us quietly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stepped out with them into the sunlight, trembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite myself. The sunset westward threw brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">light over the enclosure, and the Venerians were running</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the great metal framework at its other side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nebo pointed obliquely upward. There, high in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-streaming heavens, hung a little ball of light drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping rapidly on a steep slant toward the enclosure. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I saw it, I became aware of a faint, throbbing sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was rapidly growing louder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick!" cried Nebo. "We must be at the framework</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it lands!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With him and the Venerian guards close about me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other Venerians running nearby, I was hustled</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the enclosure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking up, as I stumbled on with my captors, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the little light-ball was a metal sphere, a huge globu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar craft, gleaming in the sunset's light, as it sank with</seg><seg type="columnLine">slackening speed toward the framework. The throbbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it was now a loud and continuous thunder in our ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT CAME lower, more and more slowly, a colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-hundred foot metal ball sinking toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">framework built to receive It. I was half-way across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure now with Nebo and the other Venerians. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a new sound smote my ears over the thunder of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">descending Venerian ship, I looked up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I yelled, and from Nebo and the Venerians came cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of amazement and alarm. The new sound I had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">SPACE-ROCKET MURDERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">601</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was a staccato roar and as it came to a crescendo, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">an airplane speeding over the enclosure from the east!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind it were three more and behind those a half-dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, roaring at top speed toward the Venerian ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even now was settling into the framework!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The planes dived and from them came the rattle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their guns speaking over their motors' roar, pouring a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaden hail down on the framework and ship in it! I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venerians by the framework fall, saw a door in the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">globular ship's curving side swing open and Venerians</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerge, pointing up at the planes and shouting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nebo forgot me for the moment, cried orders rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Venerians at the buildings. They ran to the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpedo-like fliers, and in a moment these soared up</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the planes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Venerians holding me sought again to drag me to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the framework and ship, but now I was struggling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting with fists and feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as I fought, I saw the airplanes and the Venerian</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers above engaging in a wild dog-fight. Two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fliers crashed at the same moment against a plane and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all three fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From the remaining two fliers sprang jets of clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid and in quick succession two planes burst into</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames and spun downward. But there followed one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fliers and then the other as remaining planes poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">a storm of lead upon them and through their windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was a chorus of yells from the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure and on its eastern and southern embankments</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared troops of men, brown-uniformed soldiers with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles, running down into the enclosure and firing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venerians and the framework holding the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this, the Venerians left in the enclosure ran toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the framework. I saw them swarming up a metal stair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way toward the open door of the huge ship. Nebo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my guards were dragging me despite my struggles toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mighty framework.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Abruptly three of my guards dropped around me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same moment I felt something like a hot iron sear</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulder. I wrenched free from Nebo and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard and stumbled away from them, as more rifle-bullets</seg><seg type="columnLine">hummed past us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Nebo and the Venerian ran after me and then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly they too collapsed and lay still. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venerian left living in the enclosure save those clamber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the great ship. And as I dropped to my knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw the last of them hasten into it, saw the great door</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponderously close, and then with a sudden terrific, throb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing thunder, whose detonations almost split the ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge ball rose into the air from the framework.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, majestically, at first, but faster and faster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mighty sphere rose into the 9unset, unheedful of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively tiny airplanes that dashed and stung about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--rose until it was far overhead, a dwindling light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Soldiers dashed past me toward the framework and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then arms caught and pulled me to my feet. Men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilian clothes were about me, all crying out together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Lloyd!" shouted one of them, and I came out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my daze to recognize Arthur Melford's excited face, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then beside him was Captain Crail, his features taut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and von Gersten with blue eyes flaming with excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Lloyd, we got here in time!" Arthur was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeping. "By heaven, they were taking you to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"To Venus, yes," I said. "But how did you know that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you should come here? How did you learn where their</seg><seg type="columnLine">base was?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The one I shot!" Crail cried. "We found a metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">world-map in his pocket with lines drawn on it all radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ating from one point in Eastern Labrador. And von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gersten . .. ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Von Gersten," the German finished for him, "sees</seg><seg type="columnLine">that that point in Eastern Laborador can be but their</seg><seg type="columnLine">base, where they come forth from on their trips over</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. We get the soldiers and the planes and hurry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this point, in time to save you, though their ship gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, it seems. And you say, to Venus!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Venus!" I exclaimed. "Look, can you see it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up there--can you see it yet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> High in the brilliant western sky the globular ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now but a little ball of light, diminishing steadily as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose on a steep slant. Up and up it went, smaller and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller it became in appearance. And below it we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see another speck of light, but one that was sinking after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun, the planet Venus dropping from our sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then as we stared in awe, von Gersten and Crail and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arthur and I close together, we saw the receding light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball become a mere pinhead of luminescence, a tiny shin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing point. It seemed to waver for a moment in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision, to hesitate. Then it was gone and we stood staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">after it into the empty sunset sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Note by Professor Herman von Gersten</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE is nothing which I, von Gersten, can add</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the known facts of that most astounding series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of killings, which has come to be called "the space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket murders" and its even more astounding sequel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and explanation.

He was an instructor</seg><seg type="columnLine">in biology, one of the youngest of the staff. He was my</seg><seg type="columnLine">senior by only a few years and we struck up a fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship. We worked together quite frequently. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">specialty was cellular research. I was interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">bacteriology. Our branches of work were closely enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">related for us to be of assistance to each other. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">graduated and went to Glasgow to complete my studies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon my return to America, I set up a research lab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oratory in New York. Here again my work brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">me into contact with Doctor Carter. During the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">five years our friendship was renewed. We collaborated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in several volumes upon cellular research. Then I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived an offer as a government bacteriologist, which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted. My work took me to Washington and kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">me there for seven years. It was at the beginning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my seventh winter there that the two events occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">that changed the entire course of my life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was appointed head of the government bacteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ological staff, and I received the following telegram from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Carter.

It certainly served to stifle my elation at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news of my appointment. The message itself was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike Doctor Carter as anything conceivable.

He was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to magnify a trouble. If he said the matter was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of national importance, I could rest assured that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. Only one course lay open to me.

Frank, you will never know what I have gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">through these past three weeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But you must be starved. Come, we'll sup in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof garden. Later you can have my story."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A thousand and a half feet above New York, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass-topped conservatory, we had our dinner. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">city sprawled at our feet. North, south, east, west--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">!far as eye could reach lay that pattern of blocks, relieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there by slim fingers of stone, glass, and metal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York! New York the living, the pregnant, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperishable! Never could I look at it without having</seg><seg type="columnLine">that same thrill of achievement, of pride in all man has</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished. And now it seemed more alive than ever;</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to whisper to me and give me a message I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not translate. I turned to Carter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was leaning forward, regarding the city with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange fascination of one who looks at tragedy, grim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stark tragedy. Then he shook himself and looked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, as if he were coming out of a stupor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Frank, look at it." His voice was low; it was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voice of a man who speaks of death. "In a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks it will be gone, all gone, crushed, destroyed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which I have created. For God's sake, Frank, help</seg><seg type="columnLine">me; I need it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was convinced, somehow, that he spoke the truth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pressed him for an explanation, but it was not until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were in his car, driving toward his home, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave me the story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You know, no doubt," he began, "why I changed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">residence from New York to a mountainside in Ulster</seg><seg type="columnLine">County. My work involved certain dissection and vivi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">section; it was work which I could not perform in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded community. Thus, I established my laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">'in one of the few remaining isolated sections within</seg><seg type="columnLine">convenient driving distance of New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There, for the past three years, I have been engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon cellular research in a seemingly futile quest for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret of life. My ultimate object has been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">restoration of organs of the human body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In the beginning, I confined myself to the grafting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of limbs upon animals. Then a new thought occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. I would search for the secret of life itself, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover the basic organization of protoplasm. Once the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">idea had taken hold, it became an obsession with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Life, I reasoned, had been originally created, either by</seg><seg type="columnLine">accident or by design. What had been done once, might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have heard of the theory of spontaneous</seg><seg type="columnLine">generation ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I replied. "A theory long discarded."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True. It has been discarded, but it has never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely disproved."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But surely," I said, "you do not, in this age of exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">science, accept spontaneous generation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not? That in all probability was the manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which life came into being. And how do you account</seg><seg type="columnLine">for new diseases, new bacteria, new protozoa? No!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not only do I believe in spontaneous generation, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen it occur."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have seen it occur?" His awful earnestness</seg><seg type="columnLine">held me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. I have seen certain elements combined in cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rect quantities under given conditions assume that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we speak of as life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My senses whirled. "You have overworked, old man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You need a rest." But I believed him in spite of my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. I tried to tell myself that he was mad, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew him to be sane, mercilessly sane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said. "Would to God that I were mad, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am not, unless you mean the madness of fear, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you have done what man has dreamed of doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the ages--you have created life?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Either life or something that resembles life more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than anything man has heretofore produced."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why man," I cried, "do you realize what this will</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean to humanity?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt; "Yes," he said slowly, "it will mean death, ruin, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction, and ultimate doom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke no more, but gave his attention to the road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowing Doctor Carter, I did not press him for further</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation, but turned over, in my mind, what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just told me. Undoubtedly, he was preparing me for</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were well out of New York now, and swirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the new West Shore speed highway. A slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall of snow had covered the ground, and the road, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright white ribbon in the moonlight, stretched away</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was almost midnight when he put his car up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last stretch of road, a rough lumber track which wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">its way up a seemingly impassable mountainside. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterly cold, and the snow upon the road made the go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing doubly difficult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sigh of relief I sank into a commodious chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stretched my feet toward the Doctor's blazing fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After steaming tea had further fortified us against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterness of the night, we took our pipes to the library</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Doctor continued his story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frank," he said, looking at me through the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke that curled about his face and hair, "did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever realize how greatly our imaginations are limited</seg><seg type="columnLine">by what we know or have seen. What has man ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">done that is truly creative? What has he ever con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived that is not a repetition of that which has existed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. True, he has introduced variety, but is he ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pable of imagining that which is a true departure from</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything heretofore known? I do not think so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We know only one form of life, that which has the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell as a basis. Knowing only that form, we can con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">WRATH OF THE PURPLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">605</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive of no other. Frank, can you picture life with no</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellular structure; life that has no form; life that is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">protoplasm; life that is life in name only? Can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture elements, energized so that they can absorb</seg><seg type="columnLine">nourishment from the earth or the air, and yet having</seg><seg type="columnLine">no discernible means of doing so? Can you picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a thing doubling its size every three or four days</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disintegrating all organic matter which it comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">into contact with? Can you picture that thing, let loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a peaceful countryside, increasing its bulk at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unthought of rate, destroying, like some grim reaper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all in its path? Calculate its rate of increase and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will know what I know, that if that thing is not de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed within thirty days, not only America, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire world is doomed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS was too much for a finite mind to quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp. Either the man was mad--but no, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave no lie to his sanity. He spoke the truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But come," I said, "take the funereal expression off</seg><seg type="columnLine">your face. If such a thing exists, it is not invulnerable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We must act quickly and destroy it while it is yet small</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to control."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Small enough to control!" He shook his head wear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily. Slowly he got to his feet and passed a worn hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his brow. Motioning for me to follow, he led ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way through the house to one of the rear rooms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here he threw open a window, unlocked the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutters, and pointed up the hillside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There," he said, "does that look small enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">control?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I drew back in surprise. From a point about two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards above us to another point three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards further up, the mountain side was dull purple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The silver rays of the full moon lit its surface with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unearthly radiance. Almost it seemed alive, like some</seg><seg type="columnLine">great omnipotent monster lying in wait for its prey. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape it was roughly circular, its height, as nearly as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could judge, was over thirty feet. Its strangest feature</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the illusion of transparency it gave an observer. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined that I could see into it, deep into its violet core,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and discern dull purple fires. I did not need the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Doctor Carter to assure me that it was alive, potent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carter pointed to the center of the purple mass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That was my laboratory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silently, we returned to the library. I had a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctance to speak, to discuss that thing upon the hill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. A feeling of lethargy, of futility had overtaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Wearily, I sank into a chair. The Doctor stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the hearth, his drawn features outlined in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson glow of the flames.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have three days here--in this house. Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be gone." His voice was tired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said nothing. I was thinking, or rather trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">force my harassed brain to function. Now, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, I wonder that I did not suggest some plan of</seg><seg type="columnLine">action, some method of attack. Perhaps it was due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feeling of helplessness, of despair which the Purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">exerts upon all who see it for the first time, or perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was because I suddenly realized the vast responsibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would rest upon me, as head of the government</seg><seg type="columnLine">bacteriological staff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor was speaking again. "My assistant slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the laboratory. I left him there--with the Purple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the morning he was dead--in the Purple. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">body-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face was working, straining as he lived over that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fatal morning, when we saw the first of its victims.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since then, I have attempted to destroy it. I tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything--gas, heat, bacteria, dynamite, acid--all to</seg><seg type="columnLine">no avail. Once, intense heat might have killed it. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is too late. It thrives upon cold. Acid makes almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">no impression upon it. You could explode a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons of dynamite in it and every minute fragment would</seg><seg type="columnLine">live and grow. I have injected it with bacteria, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every obtainable species, yet they have less effect than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would have upon the earth itself. I have attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to grow molds and fungus upon it. All was futile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It destroys all that is organic, acts as a powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">corrosive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He held out his hands. The fingers were covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the scars of recently healed sores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This," he said, "is the result of a first contact." Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood at the hearth, silently, while I gazed moodily</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the fire. When he spoke again, it was not to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">but to the swirling flames. "You will have to inform</seg><seg type="columnLine">the authorities?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I answered. "That will be my duty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sighed, and his bowed shoulders slumped just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit more. "I put it off as long as I could. I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to know first, to see for yourself. And then, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtful as to how the populace will react."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can reassure yourself upon that score," I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It will be kept from the public as long as possible."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And how long do you think that will be, once it</seg><seg type="columnLine">begins to cover farms and cities?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will not be for some time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doctor Carter shook his head. "You do not realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed with which that thing increases itself. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days it will cover this house. A week or two more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the entire valley will be inundated. In another</seg><seg type="columnLine">month, New York; then the North Atlantic seaboard;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then count the days, before North America becomes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrifice to this thing I have created."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now, away from the brooding significance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Purple, I was recovering my assurance. I cleared my</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat and spoke more buoyantly than I had since I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived Doctor Carter's telegram. "Something there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will stop it; something that will destroy it, as re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morselessly as it destroys all in its path. Tomorrow, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will leave for Washington. The entire resources of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">government will be placed at your disposal. My staff</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be constantly at your command. Surely, before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">week is up, you will have discovered something, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing with which to fight and destroy this menace."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next morning I had my first intimate view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Purple. It had increased appreciably since last night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now, as I stood before it, I could feel it swell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow. Its smooth gelatinous surface suggested, iron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ically enough, grape jelly. I had an insane desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste some of it, to plunge my hand into it and press it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doctor Carter turned to me, a curious smile upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. He had changed visibly since the night, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown off the mantle of gloom which hung about him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now he seemed a different man. He was as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who has been given a challenge and braces himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks pretty harmless, doesn't it ?" He held a walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stick in his hand and now he plunged it into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jelly-like mass. For a moment, nothing happened, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wood seemed to wilt and crumble away. Only then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I saw that polished hardwood melt like butter, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">I realize what we were facing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">606</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OCTOR CARTER salvaged the remains of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick and cast it away. "That is what happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Johnson's body; that is what became of my labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory; and that will be its effect upon every organic</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstacle that bars its path. You see, then, that we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing ultimate destruction."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had phoned for the county sheriff and when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to the house, he was waiting for us. I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained to him the situation and the developments we</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected. From his attitude, I could see that he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were either mad or the engineers of a huge hoax.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was only after I had shown him my credentials and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given him a first hand exhibition of the action of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Purple, that the twin lights of fear and belief ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I explained explicitly the developments that were ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected in the three days I would be gone, and how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was to communicate with the state police and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the district within a radius of two miles put under</seg><seg type="columnLine">martial law. He was to order complete evacuation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the district and under no circumstance was he to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">any information to the public or the press. I assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that I would return in three days or less, and that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until then, no measures, other than those I had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, were to be taken against the Purple. And lastly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I warned him against the deadliness of the menace. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke was quicker and more decisive than the sting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a rattler. It killed with more certainty than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadliest infernal machine. And the death it dealt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">crueler than any man had known. No living thing must</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch its deadly surface. The growing fear in his little</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes assured me that the precautions would be well</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was high noon when Doctor Carter and I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the plane at Washington. We went first to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">offices of the Secretary of the Interior and laid the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire story before him. Only after several hours' discus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion did we convince him of its truthfulness. The sam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ples of the Purple, which we had brought from New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, were the final factor in obtaining his belief. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was won over and asked us to present any plans which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had for the solution of the problem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the strange features of those first few days</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that no one of us connected with the battle against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Purple, excepting perhaps, Doctor Carter, realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full imminence of this new menace. It was signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cant that the Secretary did not, at that time, reproach</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Carter. "We must," he said, "make great sac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifices in the name of science." And he was one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who later suggested hanging Doctor Carter as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpetrator of one of the most terrible and destructive</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimes against humanity. This, to show what panic will</seg><seg type="columnLine">do to the most staid of mankind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Firstly, I asked that all chemical and biological re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sources of the country be placed at the disposal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Carter, and secondly, that, temporarily at least,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should be placed in charge of all measures taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the Purple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Secretary assured me that this could be done, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least for the time, and then asked what steps I pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to take.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I desire," I told him, "to test the effects of gas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">electricity, and rays upon the Purple. Failing in that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will attempt wholesale destruction by chemical flames.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I also want you to use your influence to have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">army and the navy placed at my disposal, and to grant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me absolute authority within the area defined by a radius</seg><seg type="columnLine">of five hundred miles from Ulster county."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Secretary and Doctor Carter gasped in astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. What I was asking for was virtual dictatorship</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the center of the country's industrial and commer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial section.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Secretary shook his head. "I am afraid," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "that what you ask cannot be granted. Nor does</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation seem to warrant such drastic action. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be more customary, in such a predicament as this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to place the authority in the hands of the army or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">local authorities."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inwardly, I cursed his narrow-mindedness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't you see," cried Doctor Carter, "that this is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ordinary occasion; that this is an emergency unlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything heretofore encountered by man. We must</seg><seg type="columnLine">work quickly. In speed lies our only salvation, our only</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope. We cannot wait for the official machinery to</seg><seg type="columnLine">function. Both the army and the local authorities will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be slow, entangled in the conventional red tape, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are. If unchecked, even for weeks, the destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought by this thing will make the Great War harmless</seg><seg type="columnLine">by comparison. The fate of our nation, the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States of America, hangs in the balance. This is not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of politics, of territory, of state or city rights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is a crisis in the existence of humanity itself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what," asked the Secretary, "makes you believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that your colleague is the man for the dictatorship?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Carter leaned forward. "Sir," he said with</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim earnestness, "forget, for once, about your army,</seg><seg type="columnLine">your navy, your police, about all means of force. Science</seg><seg type="columnLine">has created this thing and only science can destroy it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pointed to me. "He is a man of science." The calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">assurance of his words seemed to quell the Secretary's</seg><seg type="columnLine">last doubts. He was won over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Secretary was to return to New York with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Carter remained at my Washington laboratories.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was convinced that all my efforts would be futile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before I left he had a few words with me, alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frank," he said, "once I thought I created life; now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know differently. We call it life because we can con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive no other name for it. But it is not life. Nor is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifeless. Perhaps there has been a certain change within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very atoms themselves. Perhaps we have chanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon something so different that we cannot venture a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought as to its identity. The human mind is ve/y</seg><seg type="columnLine">finite. This thing is too big for me. It leaves me be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered and terrified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Frank, I have the formula and I have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">method. What I once did, I can do again. There must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a reagent which will destroy this thing. From a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange world I drew the Purple and from the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">world I will draw its doom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I clutched at his arm. "For God's sake, Doctor, leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">that formula alone. Burn it, destroy it, but don't chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting loose another menace such as this upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frank," he retorted, "unless the Purple is destroyed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there will be no world of man to let loose another</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace upon. No Frank, we must fight this thing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a weapon yet unknown to man. It is our only hope...."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next afternoon the Secretary and I left for</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. His special plane touched the waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Upper Bay in less than an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately after landing, we directed our steps to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the City Hall, and were closeted for several hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">WRATH OF THE PURPLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">607</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Mayor. He was already cognizant of the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, having received daily reports from the up-state</seg><seg type="columnLine">officials. It seemed that the thing had increased at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbelievable rate, far beyond anything which the Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">or I had expected. We explained to the Mayor what</seg><seg type="columnLine">developments might be expected, and asked him to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared to take measures to evacuate the city. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Secretary then asked that all resources of the City be</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed at my disposal. At a time like this State and</seg><seg type="columnLine">City rights must be submerged to a common good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We were leaving the City Hall, when the first blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">feH. The voice of a news boy was bawling through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. "Wuxtry! Read all about the Purple Menace 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wuxtry!" I bought a copy and stared in bewilderment</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the heavy black type.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Country Doomed By Purple Menace!" it read. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath that, sprawled over the face of the page, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire story of the Purple Life. And the papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spared no efforts to make it sensational. Maps, cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with circles to show the advance of the Purple;</seg><seg type="columnLine">first hand pictures of the Purple itself; pictures of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land before and after the Purple had wrought its wrath;</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes, those papers certainly saw their point and played</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it. Forty days existence were given to the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Secretary tore the paper from my hands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned blue as he read it. "Someone will pay for this,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he roared. "I'll break their damned sheet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I shrugged my shoulders. After all, this was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected. According to the papers, the thing was over</seg><seg type="columnLine">two miles in diameter. Nothing of that size could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept from the public. And perhaps it was best that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">populace should be warned when the thing was yet com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratively small; it might avoid later panics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We planned our campaign. The Secretary would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to Washington. He would have to confer with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">President as to the mobilization of the nation's forces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He left me with full authority to undertake those mea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sures which I had suggested, and even went to the trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">of chartering a plane for my own use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Blase New York took the matter calmly. People dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussed it at their dinner tables, and it became a subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">for intellectual controversy, but they held little doubt as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ability of the authorities to control it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I made provision for the transportation of the chem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icals and the gas, and then took a taxi to Curtis Field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There, I obtained the planes needed in the work and</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided for the establishment of a base in the vicinity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Purple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I flew to the scene of action. The fact that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place was under martial law did not serve to dispel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds of the curious. One of the small country towns</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already been partly buried by the gelatinous mass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The State Police were attempting to clear the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the houses of angry citizens. One old lady pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested that she had lived in that village for sixty years</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was not prepared to move before a pile of grape</seg><seg type="columnLine">jelly. That little incident cast a shadow of coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubles. Would millions of people part with their most</seg><seg type="columnLine">cherished possessions willingly? Would they be pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive, or would we witness mob revolt unprecedented in</seg><seg type="columnLine">history? I wondered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One glance at that quivering violet pile convinced me</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the futility of my efforts. A solid wall of purple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a hundred feet in height, stretched away upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side. Its movement was clearly perceptible now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and like some grim monster, it came on, destroying all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">before it. I thought of that glacier, which was some day</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cover the earth with a blanket of unending ice. Rue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, I reflected that the story was not far from consum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation, only this time it was not ice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TROOPS were arriving in a steady stream, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the low hum of planes. Several loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">detonations came from the Purple and making out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">squadron of bombers, I remembered Doctor Carter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. "You could explode a thousand pounds of dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mite in it and every minute fragment would live and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Futile, I thought, all is futile. No efforts of man can</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy that bulk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the chemicals and gas came, I proceeded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my experiments. The pitiful insignificance of my ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terials chilled my heart. It was all so useless, so terribly</seg><seg type="columnLine">futile. As I expected, the Purple remained unaffected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tear gas, mustard gas, chlorine, hydrogen, helium--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tried and all failed. On the morrow I would pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceed with my plan of chemical combustion. The Secre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary had pulled the wires well. Thousands of tons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">combustibles were arriving hourly. But no hope rose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my breast. The Purple was too great, too powerful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The chill about my heart increased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before dark I took an observation flight over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Purple. One speaks easily of three or four miles, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not until I had seen the Purple from above, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen that livid blot upon the peaceful landscape, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized how very much land could be included in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle of that diameter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the dark of the night I was awakened by a trooper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Purple had increased at a rate beyond that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had expected. It was at our very bedsides. I slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the gray of the dawn we commenced operations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plane after plane circled above the Purple and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually a living stream of fire. Soon the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Purple had become a leaping mass of flames. For two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours operations continued and then the supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemicals was exhausted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a last crushing blow to look upon that unruffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple surface. If the flames had done any harm, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too insignificant to be noticed. Life, then, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">very, very hopeless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next days were reminiscent of the retreat of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">defeated army. Step by step we gave ground to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Purple. To what purpose the government massed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">troops about the Purple, I do not know. It is strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in times of stress man's first thoughts are of force.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the troops only sat by their guns, although now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again they moved in orderly retreat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Water was a last futile hope. Would- the advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple tide cross the Hudson River? Anxiously we</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited and then we saw--saw our last hope dashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces. The Purple overtook the stream, and, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster animal rolling its bulk in some tiny water hole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispersed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the Nation awoke to the crisis. Not yet with</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic, but with the grim seriousness of a country going</seg><seg type="columnLine">into war. And like a nation going into war, they mob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilized their forces of relief and oppoation. Then, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud of my country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I need not weary you with a detailed account of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which you know so well; the advance of the Purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">through New York State. Sufficient to say that I aged</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lifetime in the next week. In my dreams I live over</seg><seg type="columnLine">608</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">those days, and often I wake, cold and wet, to see again</seg><seg type="columnLine">those proud cities smothered beneath the mass of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Purple. Arrogant in its omnipotent wrath, it crept down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hudson River, overwhelming and destroying, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one, the cities that had arisen upon her banks. Pough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keepsie, Newburgh, Tarrytown, Irvington, Yonkers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each in turn surrendered to the unhalting mass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was in New York when the great exodus began.</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York was being abandoned. New York the great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">file jewel of America, the most magnificent metropolis</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a world, was spread upon the altar, a sacrifice to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Purple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the tower of the old Empire State Building we</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the advance of the Purple. It seemed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">notwithstanding the efforts of the police to clear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, the greater part of the populace had delayed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure until the last moment. Now, like crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams of ants, the cars and people poured over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridges that were the outlets of Manhattan. Now one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lines threw itself into a tangle. Woman screamed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistles shrilled, automobile horns sounded, and the cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and people piled up in an ever increasing mass. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets were black with people for blocks around, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shrieking, groaning, fear-ridden mob. Later, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that almost a thousand lives had been snuffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in that mad scramble to leave the doomed city. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridges and streets were still choked with frightened hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manity, when the first of the Purple came into sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, majestically, like some deliberate stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, the Purple poured over the city. Reluctantly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though loath to part with what had so long been its</seg><seg type="columnLine">heritage, the city gave over its countless dwellings to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">irresistible tide. First to yield was the residential sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of Bronx and Manhattan. Easily, the Purple made</seg><seg type="columnLine">its conquest there. More stubborn were the skyscrapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of midtown. Even after the Purple had passed them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they held themselves aloft, cried that they would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow, that they were New York the eternal. Silently we</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched it until the Purple was beneath our very feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The city was dead now, cleared of all humanity, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few observers who retreated before the Purple. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the last to leave that silent place. Step by step we</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave ground to that rolling tide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hours later my plane circled over New York. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vast tombstone, a city that was dead. Where streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and houses had been, where traffic had roared and mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions of people slept, only the purple tide eddied. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then a faint crash would mark the yielding of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other proud skyscraper to the weight of the Purple. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">noble city had died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All America unselfishly joined in the relief work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Millions were homeless. The task of feeding and hous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them was one to stagger the stoutest of nations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, added to those were the millions daily made home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less by the advance of the Purple. Connecticut, Rhode</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jersey, Pennsylvania, one and all they felt the relent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less grip of the Purple Life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE world was first awakening to the imminence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new menace, and it was with the wild fearful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the cornered hart, who sees the hunters approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but is kept at bay by the dogs. A wave of panic</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept the world. There was talk of an exodus to Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Venus in the new rocket ships. Others suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">digging vast caverns into which the people would retreat</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the Purple had conquered the world. Fanatical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">preachers screamed of the Judgment Day, while gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired scientists shook their heads in despair. A world-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide panic, which dwarfed into insignificance the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of ninety thirty-two, gripped the financial world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then began the great American emigration. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought superseded all others: that America was doomed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thousands fled to Europe, until the European nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw up immigration barriers and forbade further</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge upon their shores. Then they turned to Canada.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first refuge was not denied; then when the Cana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dians saw the Purple approach their border, they forbade</seg><seg type="columnLine">immigration. Troops were thrown along the border and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in places pitched battles were fought. 'There would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been war then, were not war so futile in the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that greater menace, the Purple. In Mexico the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was different. At first, Mexican troops were thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the border. Then the Southwesterners grew des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate. They stormed the border and in parts broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, although those that did, were wiped out as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as they were in Mexico proper. The world from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an orderly group of nations, became an uncalculating</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob. Rioting grew in all countries. Two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of civilization were forgotten. Pandemonium</seg><seg type="columnLine">reigned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then a voice above the others cried out against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the perpetrator of this crime. And the cry was taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">up by the masses until the name of Doctor Carter was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed in every country upon the face of the earth. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">second Judas, they called him--a man who had not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">betrayed his master but humanity itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then I received a message from Doctor Carter--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first since we parted at Washington. "Am on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">track," it read. "Come quickly if possible." I left at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. Anything was better than to watch the Purple in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its remorseless advance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Washington fell beneath the Purple, the Gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment moved to Columbus, Ohio. There, in the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that had been set aside for our use, I met Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter. He had changed, changed in more ways than</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. His hair was white and his face was thin to ema-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciation. But the difference lay in his eyes. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, shining, as are the eyes of a man who has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched from the jaws of death. And in them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope, such as I had not seen in the eyes of any man</seg><seg type="columnLine">for days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frank," he said, "these past days have gone badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you. You have worked hard, too hard." It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">typical of Doctor Carter that at a time when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared to disclose a secret that gave life to man, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should inquire as to my health. He was ever thus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking little of himself and much of others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There will be no rest," I answered gloomily, "until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Purple is gone or the earth becomes a place of dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doctor Carter was smiling now, the first smile I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen for many long days. "And it will be gone, Frank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as we can manufacture enough rays to</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ray, rays?" I shook my head. "Destroy it?" Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shook my head. Something in the scheme of things</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wrong, radically wrong. I should not be here, lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tening to wild speculation; I should not be gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope; I should be back there, back with the Purple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting it, building futile barriers, lighting pitiful fires,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting, always fighting. I should not be here. I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hope. There was no hope, no hope, only the Purple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Purple. Suddenly the room flashed with a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">WRATH OF THE PURPLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">609</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sand fires. Purple flames darted about and above me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All was Purple I Purple everywhere! Then the Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bending above me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Half laughing, half crying, he led me into his study.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gave me a drink and it served to bring me to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses. Things began to right themselves and the Purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames died away. He shook hiB head reassuringly. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a simple reaction, he said; the news was too much and</seg><seg type="columnLine">too good, after the terrific mental tension. I sighed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped back in the chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, suddenly, I sat up and looked at him. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't fooling me, you weren't jesting! Tell me you</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't jesting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He shook his head. "I was not," he said slowly. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked to the center of the room and laid his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a small replica of one of those great power-lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">they use on landing fields. "This,", he said, "is our</seg><seg type="columnLine">salvation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But what-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Again he shook his head. "I cannot explain. I hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand it myself. You remember that it wa3 with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ray that I brought about the change in matter that</seg><seg type="columnLine">created the Purple. That ray did something to the atoms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed some part of their inner structures. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been experimenting with that same ray, attempting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">create life again, attempting to find something that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy the Purple. Then I thought of varying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave length of the ray and chanced upon this." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the thing in the center of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But what is it?" I exclaimed, "what use is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He made no answer, but turned to a large cabinet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He swung open the door, and I started back in surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was the Purple, throbbing and glowing in all its</seg><seg type="columnLine">malignancy. He swung the ray projector about until</seg><seg type="columnLine">its lens faced the cabinet. Then he touched a button</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon its surface. There was a blue flash, a rush of air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and where the Purple was, showed only the metal sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cabinet. Holes gaped from its rear panel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall behind it was similarly scarred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Doctor turned to me and smiled, for I was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing at the spot where the Purple had been. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">very dangerous," he said. "Had I left it on for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, the house would be down upon our heads."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WAS speechless. I could only gasp, "What is it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Doctor turned to the projector. "A practical</seg><seg type="columnLine">disintegration ray. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It is said that we are possessed of a certain sixth</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense, an intuition. Perhaps it was this that made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor so carefully instruct me in the manufacture and</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of the ray. He warned me not to delay, but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike at once. Time was precious. Each hour, thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of people were being made homeless. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">country must turn to the manufacture of the ray pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectors. "Hurry," he urged me, "time is precious."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And then from without there came a murmur; like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rising power of the surf, it rose and swelled. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattle of stones sounded against the broad windows. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor and I stepped towards them. A huge mob of</seg><seg type="columnLine">homeless men and women had gathered in the court,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now they surged back and forth, calling out Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter's name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Doctor turned to me, a strange smile upon his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">face. "I will tell them," he cried, "we are sure of suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess ; let them be happy too." And before I could move</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop him, he stepped out upon the tiny stone balcony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raised his arms for silence. There was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamic in his presence, something which quieted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob, as oil quiets troubled waters. Then he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice was powerful, musical with suppressed glad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. Slowly he spoke, begging them to forgive him, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgive him for what he had done and now had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power to undo. Then, from somewhere in the mob,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a shot. Doctor Carter crumpled back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room, hands clenched at his breast. The mob, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sudden fear, melted away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knelt beside him and lifted his head. He murmured</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few words about the ray projector, and died. I knelt</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, warm tears rolling down my cheeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day the nation, from depths of despair, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted to heights of wildest exultation. They had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">martyr and they had a cure. Life again was good. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could think only of my friend, lying before that win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow, dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What need to tell more? What need to tell of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">next days, days through which I moved as does one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in the grip of a nightmare, and always with the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that white-haired scientist before me. But they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of this chronicle, and happy days they were; hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piness that, to me, was mixed with grief, grief over him</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was my friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As an individual, the nation turned to the manufac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of the ray projectors. Every available factory ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">day and night. The projectors poured forth in an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ending stream. Day and night the blue flames crackled;</seg><seg type="columnLine">day and night men fought the Purple. Foot by foot it</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave ground. More projectors came forth, more blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames darted against the Purple, and more ground came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from beneath its grasp. It was a hard fight, but not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing one. Each new bit of ground that emerged gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fighters further hope. Then, twenty-one days after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day on which I first saw the Purple, the last of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread menace disappeared into nothingness. The world</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a deep breath and sighed. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are those who say that good came of the Purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">Life.

Even when the sun was not shining it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant room. Only the low tables with their clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass receptacles of every size and shape, the chest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelves along the back wall, with its rows of bottles</seg><seg type="columnLine">tagged with strange scientific names and an occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange pungent odor told one that this was a room</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted to science.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the duty of Mike Turey to keep his laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">neat and clean.

Then care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully he watered the potted plants, brought in cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers from the garden to set in the many vases and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowls about, weeded and trimmed the flower boxes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike was also the some-time assistant to the professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">helping the scientist when a second hand was needed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">some delicate task.

Now he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumping into the laboratory weighted down with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">watering cans, his limp just barely noticeable. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a darkish, cloudy day in April, and on such days his</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg ached a bit more than usual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mary!" A crash, the gurgling splash of water on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiles as the watering cans dropped from nerveless</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and Mike, the efficient, stood rooted to the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">just within the French window of the laboratory, star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing agape at his wife settled in one of his master's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chintz-covered chairs, hands folded in her lap, her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and body bathed in the golden glow of a light from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp over her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That the lamp was not an ordinary one was evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first glance.

Mike's second cry was a shriek, for it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not given every man to see his plump wife shrinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a child again, which was exactly what was happen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. From a big-bosomed, comfortable sort of a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">of five feet four inches tall, she had already shrunk to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">610</seg><seg type="columnLine">= y - •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">611</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The beast watched him closely.

But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp-cord was his undoing. It caught his bad foot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent him crashing forward, the momentum of his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">overturning his wife's chair and the lamp in one blow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracking his head upon the tile floor with such force</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he lost consciousness for several minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cataclysm that had carried the lamp and chair to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor with Mike, had acted as a catapult upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's diminishing form, flinging her across the near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est flower box. And there she hung, her head upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box's edge, her feet dropping over the side, only, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she continued to shrink in size, it could be seen that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box would soon be large enough to contain all of her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the spreading fan of the golden ray from the lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">still shone upon her, as it now shone upon the prone</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of her husband huddled close to the flower box!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOME minutes later, Mike raised his aching head, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was not the only part of him that ached; every</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone, every muscle ached as if he had indulged in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">new sort of bodily exercise that brought every muscle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his body into play, more than he knew he possessed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A groan pushed its way up his throat, then another; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found he enjoyed groaning. For several minutes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">practiced this until he found the groans cost him un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary effort and he desisted. Instead, he tried sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and was surprised to find he could do it. But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange place was this?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All around him, for what seemed miles, was a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain, a deep red, a plain that might have been called</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat, though of exceeding roughness. He could not call</seg><seg type="columnLine">them hills; they were more like rough pits, crater pits</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as he had known in the war, only his mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too stunned now to associate such ideas. He could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of his immediate present, and try to place it in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory. The plain seemed to have a glossy finish at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one time, but now it was dulled, roughened, only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high points of the craters retained a reminiscent polish</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the past. A sort of diffused gray light hung over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and by placing a hand above his eyes and squinting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could see strange, undefinable shapes in the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">distances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what was this? Out of the heavens was falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange rain. He called it rain for want of a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, but he could not remember such a rain as this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for from all sides was a continuous falling of strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">particles, boulders of every size and shape from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of a baseball to several times the size of his head--</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticks, long and short, of every color, every hue drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping around him on all sides, obscuring the landscape</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly, making it necessary to dodge their blows. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear them falling to the ground, click, crash, boom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One hit his shoulder, another fell across his extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">kgs. Luckily they were not heavy and did not hurt him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he knew the large boulder coming down through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air toward him would hurt unless he dodged it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tolled to one side under it and got to his feet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass plopped into the spot where he had been sitting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly, as if gravity did not matter much here. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at it carefully. It was cube-shaped and had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of iron. It was smooth to his touch and cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air cleared a moment of the falling debris and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed around him. Far to his right was the dark line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a crevice in the plain, grayish in color, a ravine of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallow depth. On its opposite side lay a second plain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue in color, a dull grayish blue. Looking to the left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could discern a second ravine more distant than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one on his right, and beyond it lay a second plain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue. Before him the red plain was wide and he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">just make out the crack that enclosed it. But turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his heel, he saw that less than forty yards from</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he stood was a fourth crevice and a fourth blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain. It seemed the most natural thing in the world to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that he should be standing on a red plain cut by</seg><seg type="columnLine">four straight dikes with blue plains on their other sides.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tried to recall where he had seen that pattern before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but so strange seemed his awakening, he could not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">recall the past beyond the point of his awakening here</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the red plain. It was an effort to try to think. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could feel a bump on the side of his head and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">attributed his loss of memory to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the idea of orientating himself still further, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied the landscape beyond the four coulees. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue plains seemed identical, as far as he could see, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the fourth, where he discerned in the middle distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great thick column sloping upward from the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">at about a thirty degree angle, rising so high into the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was unable to see its end; it seemed to go right</seg><seg type="columnLine">up into the indistinguishable blue of the heavens them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. And beyond that he could just make out, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hazy distance, what was apparently a high wall, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that did not interest him yet. It was the column set</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in all the vastness of this great pattern that at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted him; it was his whole future for the present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amid the falling things from the air he started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick his way toward the column, half-consciously dodg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the debris that piled itself up on the ground in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotch-potch, varying the natural color of the red plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their own shades. They seemed for the most part</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments of animal, vegetable and mineral matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They blocked his path making it necessary to circle them</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it was impossible to climb over them. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unstable, rolling under his feet, and what with jumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the way of those still falling, it was enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive a man out of his senses, but Mike was unusually</seg><seg type="columnLine">phlegmatic, able to take everything as a matter of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time realizing how unnatural this new place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ground under foot did not seem like a soil, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitrified substance from which the original life had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">decarbonized. Perhaps that accounted for the remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gloss that clung to the pitted surfaces. But at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was able to leave the red plain behind, as he stood on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of his first canyon, the dividing line between</seg><seg type="columnLine">red and blue plain. Carefully he made his way down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of the ravine which seemed sanded, altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from the surface of the plain he had just left</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, and it was different in color. In the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the depression, he saw half a dozen odd structures, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great round globe many times his own size. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed balls of some transparent matter, held in a state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of balance; bright things in which light seemed at play,</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing into all the colors of the rainbow as he stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them. He dared reach out to touch the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest sphere. It was elastic; it dented at his touch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pushed hard upon it with the full force of his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO FOUGHT A FLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">613</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and to his horror the sphere bulged outward and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a round sticky mouth that sucked him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere's surface. In the next instant he found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged over the surface, spun around in a miniature</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirlpool! One foot and hand remained free of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff, but for the rest of him he was caught like a fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a sticky paper, unable to move, unable to grasp any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing by which to pull himself free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After his first fright was over, he ceased struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough to consider what this strange ball might be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He noticed that whereas the stuff was sticky, elastic, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seem to wet him at all; there appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of skin over the surface of the globe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">held its contents together, protected it against contact</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, while it held him prisoner. Minutes, hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to pass, and then he noticed how cold he was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the sphere that was cold; however, it seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing some of its original size. At the same time, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was animated with a strange interior force that lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stretched it with terrific power. Then the man felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself falling. There was a violent shock, as if an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion had taken place quite near him and he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself on the ground. The ball had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a minute's pause Mike picked himself up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran wildly up the slope of the gulch to the blue plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">regardless of the bruises he had sustained from his fall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stopped, breathless, on its edge to look backward at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the transparent spheres below. Not one was left. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone, exploded!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The surface of the blue plain hardly differed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the red plain. It also looked as if it were ossified,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were the irregular piles of debris fallen from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky, mounting as more came down. His crippled leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to pain him as he pushed on and on toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange tilted pillar set over in one corner of the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain, and after what had seemed an indeterminable</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of time he reached it. He was tired, weary and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry, but there was nothing edible to be found here-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abouts, nothing in this wild dreary land, nothing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets of his blue working jeans. He stood gazing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the column for a while, trying to peer upward to its end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was several times his own girth, its surface of no</seg><seg type="columnLine">material he could place. It seemed fibrous, filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of little cracks, rough, pitted. He decided the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillar must be very ancient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was, however, he concluded, hardly worth the bother</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coming to see. He turned his back upon it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed off in the distance to the high precipice etched</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the far sky. It seemed a great unbroken wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mighty mountain range, rising several thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air, stretching further than eye could see in both</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions. Mountains suggested trees, verdure, water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">food perhaps. It suggested something else beside. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his trek across the plains a single word had seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to crop persistently into his mind. "Mary, Mary," his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sluggish brain had repeated. Now something was sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesting that Mary was to be found on the mountain top,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though for the life of him he could not tell where that</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd thought came from, and exactly who Mary was!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He decided to start off immediately, but then he rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lized how tired and worn out he was. First he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, must rest his weary bones, his crippled leg. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed suddenly that the rain of particles from the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">was less heavy on the opposite side of the leaning pillar</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that which he had come. At its foot, practically no</seg><seg type="columnLine">debris fell at all. He would lie there, huddled against</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the pillar's foot and sleep awhile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mike never knew exactly what had awakened him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly he was wide awake and frightened. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes upon him; the hair on the nape of his neck was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising. He gasped when he saw the thing facing him, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great black creature with six hairy legs and two eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were divided and sub-divided into a thousand dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent parts, each part carrying a reflection of himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And never had he seen an uglier or more gruesome face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Between the eyes the face was flat but below them it</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulged out into a most fearsome mouth with heavy jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed more like tusks. In size it was as big as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant, while on its back was a pair of gorgeous, trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent wings, half-open now as if the thing was pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared for flight at a moment's notice. It exuded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong penetrating odor that reminded Mike of decay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flesh, putrefaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long the creature had been surveying him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know. A scream rose to his throat as it took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a step toward him. A step backward brought Mike's</seg><seg type="columnLine">back against the great leaning column. Its solidity felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">good there behind him. It was safety of a sort, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took another step backward, pressed against the pillar</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the creature. The beast, in consequence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a step toward him, trying to outstare him with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">many eyes while two long horns that Mike had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed before waved in front of its face. His own eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted this way and that in search of a weapon of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort, and he saw a long rough stick that could serve him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a club lying close by. It meant, however, taking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">step toward the elephantine animal, and in his extremity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike even dared this. He was surprised to see the beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a step backward as he moved forward. Ah, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was cowardly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The club was heavy, almost too heavy for Mike, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">by grasping it with two hands he succeeded in lifting it</seg><seg type="columnLine">above his head. The beast watched him dumbly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike took the offensive. With all his might he brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stick downward in a great circle toward the beast's</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening eyes, but when the stick landed, the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't there. He heard the hum of its wings as it took</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the air, then around him grew the sound of a roar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deep booming noise like thunder coming from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorax. He wheeled about to see the creature dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground on the other side of him, and again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck out with his club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time the club caught one of the creature's wings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tearing it across so it could never use it again. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">started back from him, but changing its mind, charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the man. Again Mike raised his heavy club, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring it down on the beast's clumsy head. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving horn's was broken, and the jagged head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick cut a furrow through the left eye of the beast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-blinding it. The roar of the beast grew louder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again it charged and again Mike struck out with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">club. A hairy claw racked his back, but it did not touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skin, merely tearing the cloth of his jeans off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. He lost count of its charges as he placed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy blows with precision, and each blow counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the beast. One eye was entirely gone, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only half its sight, two legs were crippled, the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond wing was frayed. It seemed to have lost all sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of direction when another blow tore the other horn</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the top of the beast's head. Now it no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared, and suddenly gave up the battle, crawling hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the enraged man. But Mike, with the lust</seg><seg type="columnLine">614</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of battle in his veins, was not through yet. Bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the club high above his head and as far back as his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go, he gave a mighty heave that sent it after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreating creature. The point entered the hard black</seg><seg type="columnLine">body just between the sagging wings, carrying it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. It lay where it fell, legs twitching, a low mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mur issuing from its body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a gruesome sight with red sticky blood oozing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its many wounds, but Mike did not have it in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart to pity it. He stood off to survey it, wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it was, what was so familiar about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why! It's a fly," he said at last, and after he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken the words, he wondered at them. A fly? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fly? Why, What? Why should he recognize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creature? Why was he here? What was he doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this oddly familiar land that after all was unfamiliar?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One after another the man put these questions to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, but he was at a loss to answer them. His mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a queerly muddled state. Faint, dim memories came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him; he was always on the verge of understanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, yet on the other hand, his mind refused him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answers, was unable to collect them properly and cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logue them for himself. He was aware of the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">something untoward had happened to him, that this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not his natural world, that nothing around him was</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural. He remembered falling asleep here on this blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain beside the leaning column; he remembered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine he had left behind, but he could not remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">what lay there before his awakening on the red plain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And here was this fly incident. He seemed to recall</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in the past he had killed other flies, many flies, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was his business to kill flies. He could turn his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it and leave it to kick away the rest of its life with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out compunction, but that did not explain what a fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, why he knew it for what it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shrugging his shoulders, he turned his back on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillar, his eyes toward the mountain range dimly visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the distance. The queer rain from the skies was less</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, and rarely a boulder came within touching distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him and he could see it falling toward him long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">it reached the point where he had been. A second coulee</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened to him and across it lay a second red plain like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first he had left behind. In his mind he called the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plains, squares, but like the fly incident, he could not find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the source of his knowledge. He was suddenly thirsty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that desire transcended every other thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing on the edge of the ravine, a shout welled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips, for in the bottom of the crevice was a shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. Water! He fairly ran down the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine, but at the water's edge he came to an abrupt halt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Certainly he had never seen an odder stream of water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had no movement, it did not appear to flow, yet it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't stagnant; it was clear. It just lay there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow, inert, and wherever it touched the shore, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges curled up, hollowed out rather, and it became con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave. A large boulder lay in the stream a half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet from where Mike stood, and the water also seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to repel it; it was, in fact, indented all around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder, forming a hollow depression around it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strange, strange world!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Puzzled, Mike bent down toward the water, deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to taste it, to learn if it were truly water. But no</seg><seg type="columnLine">--as he bent toward it, it moved, came forward to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">him! He drew back, frightened and suddenly remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered the antics of the sphere in the bottom of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon. In his mind he was able to associate the two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he could not explain them. A sigh escaped him. Was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there no succor for him in this hard land where all</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural laws seemed topsy-turvy? Just how long wa3</seg><seg type="columnLine">he going to be able to exist without drink or food ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And how was he to bridge this unique river? Could</seg><seg type="columnLine">he throw enough debris to form a bridge to cross on?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stopping, he picked up a small boulder close at hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The river received it without a splash, but the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not sink immediately. It was a slow process before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water-stuff sucked it below the surface. He shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head wearily, realizing it would take hours to fill in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a causeway at that rate. Instead, he decided to walk on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and discover if he could-not find a bridge already pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes of walking brought him to a place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river came to an end. Although the canyon floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no higher, the river simply ended abruptly. He con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded it was a lake instead of a river. The climb up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side of the ravine was difficult, for here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavy mass of sky-debris that impeded his progress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at last he climbed to the surface of the second red</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain. He lost all count of time as he headed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain range. His body appeared to be a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of individuals all crying for attention. There was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirst, together with hunger and the lame leg all clamour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for service. He stumbled on and on until the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain suddenly came to an end. He was ready to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and lie down to die, but on lifting his head his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurred eyes showed him that this was the last ravine</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he should reach the foot of the mountains. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he could descry something green a few hundred •</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above him, on the side of the mountain. In that bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green, he saw promise of food and maybe of drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only, God! What was this thing hurrying down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine toward him! So might a dinosaur have appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive man. He saw a long yellowish green serpen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tine body, several times his own length, topped by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">massive, hideously ugly head, while set along the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the body were small upright bunches of bristles at</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals. Although the beast walked the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coulee, the bristles showed above the edge of the gulch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mike started back, frightened almost out of his wits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Thing suddenly turned toward his side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine and started up the side! Its head was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level with his own, before he could control his shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees, but before he could take a step backward, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast switched from his path and passed the frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">man without a second glance his way. Mike smelt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy, earthly odor the beast exuded as it passed him by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord! It's a caterpillar!" he found himself ejacu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating and he was recalling that caterpillars after.all</seg><seg type="columnLine">were harmless creatures, herbivorous. He scurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the bank of the depression and up the other side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On, on he trudged over the rough terrain of the plain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head sunk between sagging shoulders, only occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionally lifting his head to see how much of the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the mountain he had covered. He glanced back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">only once, but found he could no longer see the leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillar that had been his first goal. Distances were</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely deceptive in this weird land, possibly due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quality of the light, but he was beyond questioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything. He could only think of that patch of green,</seg><seg type="columnLine">far up on the mountain side, which he could make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">more plainly now, but he eyed the mountain itself in fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed a great perpendicular cliff, rising straight up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the heavens, impossible for a man to climb. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain appeared to end abruptly at the cliff's foot, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain was not part and parcel of the land, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOUGHT A FLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">615</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had been placed there at some later period than placing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plains, but as he drew nearer and stood at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain foot, he realized it was not as unscalable as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared at first. The surface was fibrous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitted with irregularities, where boulders and soil had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken footing, and he could make out a number of long</seg><seg type="columnLine">crevices mounting upward. There were innumerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and foot holds in which he could find easy pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chase. He wondered at the queer structure of the cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself. It was certainly different from any mountain he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever known; at places it was soft to the touch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving under hand or foot, breaking under him some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times and sending flakes of tissue falling behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thirst and hunger were forgotten as he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make his way upward, but every few feet he had to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to rest. Then, after an indeterminable passage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, he reached the green verdure that had beckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him from afar. It was a small plot of moss and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lichen clinging to the mountain wall. A small, green</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush, covered with red and yellow berries, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken root in the moss. Food!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew it was food, for here were two bright green</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures hardly four feet in length, ugly, but harmless</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they proved, feeding on the berries. They scurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">away at his approach and immediately he appropriated</seg><seg type="columnLine">their dinner. The-berries were sweet, juicy and filling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Practically all the berries were gone before he filled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach. They gave him new life, they quenched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirst. Almost regretfully he deserted them, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain was calling him upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was more than three-quarters of the way up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain, when he glanced backward. Now he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the regular pattern of the red and blue plains he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left behind with their geometrically straight crevices,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing and recrossing as far as eye could see. Dimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could discern great shapes in the greater distances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was at a loss to name them; yet, again he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">their familiarity, felt that he had known them in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">past. He felt a yearning to be back in the life he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not recall, a yearning for his own kind, for life as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once known it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now he was tired, weary, too weary to go on. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed sleep more than he needed anything else. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about seeking a safe spot where he might stow</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, while renewing his life's forces. A shelf a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet or so above his head jutted a few feet over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff's edge. It offered haven. Hand over hand he pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself toward it head down as he picked out safe holds</seg><seg type="columnLine">for hands and feet. Thus he was unaware of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature emerging from a cave that opened upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge he sought. The creature, however, saw him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And what a creature. More than six feet high it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, reddish brown in color, with an abnormally long</seg><seg type="columnLine">body separated into three segments--head, thorax and</seg><seg type="columnLine">abdomen, the thorax and abdomen being separated by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredibly narrow waist. It was six-legged and it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pair of multi-faceted eyes that had the power of seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in practically every direction, but it depended more</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the finer selectivity of the pair of antennas sticking</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from the head just over the eyes that waved con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly in the air. Its mouth was a most savage one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">great heavy mandibles that looked as if they might bite</seg><seg type="columnLine">the climbing man in two at one stroke. It stood per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly still in the cave mouth, eyeing the unwarned</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing man. And although not a sound issued from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its throat, it was suddenly joined by a fellow creature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who came likewise from the cave and now stood beside</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the first peering over its shoulder at the on-coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey.	. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poor Mike! It was an unfair fight from the first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tired and weary, he did not raise his eyes until he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed over the abutment. Then it was too late and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he gave a good account of himself, the pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants had the advantage as they rushed from two sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once. The first ant lost one of its antenna horns in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the struggle, the second lost one of its middle legs. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike felt the first ant plunge its mandibles into his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and as soon as the sting bit into his flesh, all fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">departed. He was a prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although the first of the two red ants was larger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">its fellow, it was the second creature who picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike's suddenly limp form and tossed him over its</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. Mike knew nothing of the journey through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark tunnels of the Hill. It was the bump that</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred when his captor dropped him on a hard packed</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, that shook him back into consciousness. But con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness did not bring movement in its train and Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">found his body numb, paralyzed from the bite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect that left only his mind awake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while he could make out indefinite shapes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness around him and realized that he lay on</seg><seg type="columnLine">some soft decaying stuff that hurt his nostrils with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetid odors. He felt rather than saw the comings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">goings of his captors through the chamber in which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay. Something dropped across the small of his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay there heavily, adding its heavy smell to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others that nauseated him. Lying there, he tried to piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">together the events that had brought him here, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison the beasts had injected into his blood seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull the edge of his brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was unaware of the fact that now he was "cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">storage" in the warehouse of the red ants--"preserved"</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the time when he should become "provisions" in '</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ant vernacular (if they had such a thing). Nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">has a number of tricks up her sleeve, and, lacking proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">refrigerant methods as devised by Man, she neverthe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less has provided her pets, the ants, with a means of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own to preserve food against the time when it is needed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is a mild poison injected into the body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims, which paralyzes the nerve centers so that where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they are still alive, they are incapable of crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">away again, and must simply await the hour of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The paralysis of his nerves had caused Mike to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sense of time, and he did not know how long he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lain in his quiescent state. He slept intermittently, awak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing every now and then to the ugly odor of the nest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and decaying life around him, but at last he believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could feel a loosening up of his muscles. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">move a finger, then a hand, then his head. Possibly, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that he came of a more highly developed genus</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the ordinary victim of the ants was the reason why</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paralysis was deserting him. He flexed the muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one arm, then of the other and tried to sit up, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weight lying across his hips held him down. It took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of squirms to release him, but at last he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stretching his body, he took several deep breaths, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be nauseated anew by the thick odors surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He wondered heavily how he was to get out of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">noxious place. Something told him he must be away</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the next returning forage came with its burden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dimly he made out the faintly illuminated circle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the doorway from this chamber. Cautiously he</seg><seg type="columnLine">616</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled toward it, hoping to escape from his prison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There seemed to be some sort of faint light filtering</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the tunnel that opened to him, so he could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage walls losing themselves somewhere ahead. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">only he had a weapon of some sort, he thought; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unarmed. Moving forward about a hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tunnel, he heard a noise coming his way. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a dry scratching, as of feet upon the hard packed</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, and of something being dragged along. A new</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor came to his nostrils. It was an ant bringing part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a butterfly wing. Mike backed up slowly away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approaching sound and so he stumbled and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily. Something hard lay under him, and he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it with his hands. It was a fragment -of rock that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had tripped over. He wrapped his fingers around it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hefted it and felt better because of it. A darker blot</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the darkness of the tunnel told him the on-coming ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost abreast of where he crouched against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing stopped. There was an almost illusionary</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of light where its eyes were, and he heard a slith-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering sound as the ant dropped its burden. Mike heaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rock where the eye had been. He heard its scrunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">against something brittle, then panic seized him. It gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentum to his feet carrying him swiftly up the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction from which the ant had came. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the midst of a half a dozen beasts before he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Two tunnels crossed each other at this juncture, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party was herding a number of aphides (ant-cows) back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their stables, but when the creatures found a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">being in their midst, the combined thought was to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture him. This time Mike used hands and feet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">full advantage. A hairy leg snapped under one hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it in turn became a bludgeon against his enemies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For several moments he crouched under the abdomen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ant, and here it proved difficult for the others to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, until the ant itself managed to twist its body about</seg><seg type="columnLine">so as to make his strategy of no avail. Fighting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaying arms and feet he managed to reach the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. The tunnel seemed to overflow with ants, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">■herd of cows increased the melee, so that the beasts be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came so jammed they found it impossible to move one</seg><seg type="columnLine">way or the other as more and more came piling in from</seg><seg type="columnLine">all directions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was almost a noiseless battle with only the scraping</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grating of dry feet on the soil or of chiton-covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies rubbing against each other, and the deep, panting</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath of the man fighting for life and freedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mike's greatest care was to keep the mandibles of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts from any part of his body, to prevent a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">injection of the formic acid into his system, but though</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandibles snapped around him, they were poorly aimed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so closely packed were their wielders. Only those ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the edge of the pack against the wall of the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">could reach the man who was creeping as close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor as the forest of legs would permit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he battled, he crept forward, an inch at a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving a trail of broken legs, twisted antenna and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maimed bodies behind him. His clothing hung to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in tatters, his face and hands were scratched and torn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood flowed from a wound on one temple, getting into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, and there were several long scratches on back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chest. His breath wheezed as it came through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched teeth, blood trickled from one distended nos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tril, and his blows were growing weaker. It was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a question of minutes now before the very weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers would pull him down. He hardly knew what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">happened when the wall crumbled behind him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell headlong into the narrow opening thus revealed. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of mandibles snapped harmlessly over his head as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, and there was a scraping of rough feet as the beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to widen the mouth of the hole into which Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly aware of what had saved him so providential-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, the man sought to rise only to bang his head sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the low ceiling of the chamber in which he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, bringing kindly oblivion. He awakened to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new sense of motion to find he was being dragged along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the low tunnel into which the crumbling wall had</seg><seg type="columnLine">catapulted him, for his cave turned out to be a tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">running at right angles to the one in which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought. Even now the ants were trying with feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandibles to widen the tunnel mouth for their bulky</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies, but the passage proved too low and narrow for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The ant, who had been behind Mike when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, even now lay crushed by the numbers in the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing behind it, and the others were trying to remove it</seg><seg type="columnLine">piecemeal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment the darkness here seemed blacker than</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tunnel he had just left behind, but after a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments of concentration, Mike managed to make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shapes of the creatures dragging him. They seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smaller edition of the ants he had left behind. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">had him by the hair, the other had caught its mandibles</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shoulder strap of his overalls. The pain of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged by the hair had restored him to consciousness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a mighty effort he managed to twist his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">around so that he could put his hands upon the floor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel even though the movement caused him fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful pain, and he was ready to do battle again. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was saved that. The first ant dropped its hold upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair at his first upheaval, and the other little fellow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantically trying to tear its mandibles from the shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">strap. It succeeded just as Mike gained his hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, and he could hear the pair running hurriedly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his proximity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carefully Mike felt the tunnel walls about him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that nowhere was the diameter of the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than two feet. It meant he would have to crawl on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and feet its entire length, but considering the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clination of the floor, he gathered that the passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually rose to the surface. He guessed that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe from his erstwhile six-foot enemies, but it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">back-breaking task to crawl along for what seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours on hands and knees. Twice he came to cross-tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neels, and he grew aware of small creatures scurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from his lumbering approach. Only their ant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like appearance gave him clue to what his rescuers were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he knew too little of ant-life to guess at how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny robber-ant constructs its nest to dovetail with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the large red ant. Like the mice preying on a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">household, these tiny foragers made their excursions into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storerooms and granaries of their unwilling hosts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleeing to their narrow tunnels where the larger ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not follow when their thieving proclivities were</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he continued upward, Mike noticed the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing brighter as light filtered in from some source</seg><seg type="columnLine">far ahead. Then he thought he descried a pin-point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray light, and it gave him new life. The pin-point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light grew steadily larger and at last he reached an open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. A guardsman ant stood in the entrance, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurried away at his approach, and he was free to step</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the green world of the mountain top. The robber</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOUGHT A FLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">617</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel had led him directly up to the plateau of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain-range!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before him lay a wide land beyond which he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see a mighty forest of every sort of tree and plant im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aginable bedecked with flowers and swept by sweet fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean breezes. Paradise after Hell!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cautiously he crawled forth, peering on every side</seg><seg type="columnLine">for lurking enemies. His first thought was a weapon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A round dry stick lay close to the tunnel opening and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this he quickly appropriated. A small, round stone that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted to his hand tempted him next, and he dropped it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his pocket for safe-keeping. He saw that here</seg><seg type="columnLine">again the air was filled with falling rocks, fibrous woody</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticks of debris, blocks of solid metal. The forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered protection from the attack from the skies, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a long way off. Still there was no reason to linger</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, and he feared that the nest of the red ants might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have their exit somewhere near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The way across the barren-lands, as he named the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space lying between him and the forest, was exceedingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult. The ground was spongy under foot, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landscape almost mountainous. He had to pick his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully, usually following an arroyo that seemed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains of a dry water-course, using every out-jutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">promontory as a protection from the raining skies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was hungry, thirsty and weak from his past experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ences and loss of blood. At times, everything went black</seg><seg type="columnLine">before his eyes, he grew dizzy and went reeling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbling along, not caring what should happen. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he thought he could not take another step, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tongue felt like flannel-cloth in his mouth, he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a bed of moss in which grew a bush covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">red and yellow berries like those he had found on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain side. Again he feasted ravenously and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of lying down for some sleep, but twice when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sought rest he had been attacked by the horrible beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this terrible world, and besides there was no cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the skies, and he had to go on, on to the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Climbing to the top of a tor, or small hill that stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher than the surrounding country to take his bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, he was suddenly elated by the sight of a monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">statue set alone in all this wilderness. It reminded him</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the leaning pillar that had interested him back on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plains. There was no path leading to it, but he felt that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he could reach it, many things would be explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The statue represented an ugly, foreign, yellow face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with squinty almond-shaped eyes. Its garments were</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, foreign looking, and there was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar about it. He tried to remember where he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen a like statue. A vague glimmering of the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">assaulted his brain, but again he was unable to trace out</seg><seg type="columnLine">its meaning; his mind seemed to refuse to function past</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain point. The statue, however, was a sign, a sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there must be creatures somewhere around who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">built *it. He climbed to the pedestal and gazed in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions, and thu3 he caught a gleam of water in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance, and a great high bridge crossing it! Now far</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the water, lay the outpost of the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started to run toward the lake, but his muscles re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">belled, so he was forced to take it at a walk that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly more than a crawl, as he was creeping painfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the obstructions that filled his path, sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing his direction, continually dodging the debris from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skies. Then he came to the lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chagrined, he stared with popping eyes. It wasn't a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake after all, but a hard clear surface that reflected his</seg><seg type="columnLine">image. He gazed at himself in disappointment. Whajt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a sight he was. An inch long stubble covered his face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hair was a sweaty mass caked with dried blood, dirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaked his face and hands where they were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratched and bruised, his jeans were in tatters, hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him by threads. His face was thin, haggard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Getting to his feet, he stared at the bridge crossing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror lake. He sneered. What sort of people were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they who built a bridge over a surface of such a type.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He disdained to use the bridge and stepped upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">imitation lake instead. It was not so smooth as it ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared at first glance; it was bumpy with irregularities</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its surface, bubbles showed just under the skin, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was difficult to walk upon, like ice. But anything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than the surrounding country, and he wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the trees. Sky debris fell upon the mirror as on</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything else, adding to his difficulties; pebbles rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his feet as he walked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mirror-lake did not reach to the edge of the woods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carefully he began picking his way anew over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough, uneven ground. There it was he heard the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help, Help. For God's sake, someone, save me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike! Mike!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A voice, a living voice! And wonders and wonders he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the voice. It was calling him. "Mike, Mike, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mary, I'm coming, I'm coming!" He was surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear his own voice answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came from the middle of the trees ahead. Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed hint. He did not stop to question who Mary was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew. Mary was part of him; Mary was his, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she needed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was running now between hillocks, unconsciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodging the falling fragments from the sky. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was forgotten. His weariness was of the past; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot his lame foot. He reached the trees, great, thick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalked trees many times his own girth, that had queer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight branches out of which grew giant leaves many</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards across. Then there were strange blade-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths rising straight from the ground to unguessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">heights. Gargantuan flowers topped the strange trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and filled him again with a sense of his own puniness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this was not the time to consider such things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "MIKE, Oh Mike, will you never come ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm coming, I'M COMING!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here the trees were at well spaced intervals, but as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried on toward the voice, he found .himself plunging</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a wild tangle of rank undergrowth--the like of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had never seen. Saw-toothed grasses, taller</seg><seg type="columnLine">than his own head, brambles, spine-cover.ed vines tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him, held him back, and every step he took was a fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">in itself. He had only made a few feet of progress to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the moaning voice, when a great shadow swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him and the air was filled with a roaring thunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ducked to the left without looking, into a thicket</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brambles that cut him cruelly, but the brambles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than the death swooping upon him in the shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a long, snake-shaped body upheld by twin pairs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide transparent wings, iridescent wings, each yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">across. He cowered among the thick, fleshy leaves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bramble-bush, realizing he was safe from the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strous flying thing. It seemed ages before the dragon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly gave up hope of an easy meal and departed with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear-crushing whoosh of its lovely wings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mike did not climb from the brambles for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes after the fly was gone, then he painfully ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">618</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted himself from the thorns, leaving a good part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what remained of his clothing adhering to the vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">spikes. Again he heard the beckoning, terrified voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling. And he renewed his efforts to push through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he saw her. She was almost in his path, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first glance he thought she was merely standing there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at him, but the second glance showed her a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner, a strange, shapeless bundle, hanging in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocoon within a foot or so of the ground, wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">around with thick heavy cords, as thick as his thumb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were other ropes, dirty white ropes caught to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves and branches of two great trees, and he traced</seg><seg type="columnLine">them upward to a spot high above him, where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed joined in a hub with innumerable other ropes</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming from all directions. On one of the ropes, high</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the hub, was the round, black, eight-legged figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the owner of the web. He knew it for a spider im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately and realized that Mary was the spider's</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She saw him as soon as he saw her, and tears sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her eyes. "Mike, where have you been? Come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">get me out of here before that devil from hell comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way. I . . . I . .' ." she began to sob pitifully, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">controllably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's heart was full at the sight of her. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to take her in his arms, to soothe her fears, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">first she must be freed. He came to her side and grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the ropes to try its strength, only to find it horribly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticky so his hand adhered to it. It took real effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull the hand away. If only he had a knife! But in</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieu of that, he looked for a sharpened stick. The ropes</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found were quite elastic, their real strength lying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sticky covering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's coming, he's coming. Quick, Mike, he will stab</seg><seg type="columnLine">me again !"*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked up to see the spider hurrying down a rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards them. It had felt the shaking of the rope and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming to investigate. Mike remembered the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his pocket and let it fly at the oncoming arachnid. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">missile seemed to stun the creature for a moment, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">again it came on. Mike espied a long pole lying in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle of brambles. He could use it as a spear to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spider away from Mary at least. Mary was moan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, then suddenly she was filling the air with one pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed shriek after another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PROFESSOR DUNCAN TRENT ushered his emi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent friend and guest, Dr. Yowell Morely, entomolo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gist, into his pleasant laboratory after the long drive from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the station. Dr. Morely had hurried from New York to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see his friend on receiving a note, requesting his presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in regard to a new ray Trent had just discovered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They came into the bright room laughing and talking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly unprepared for the sight to meet their eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My T-Ray Lamp!" It was Trent who cried out</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he pointed a shaking finger at the spot where his latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention lay on the floor beside a fallen chair. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend was forgotten as he rushed to pick up the lamp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">examining it to see if it were damaged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Someone's been using it," he ejaculated; "the bulb</seg><seg type="columnLine">is still warm, though it has burnt out.

Oh, the vandals, the . . . oh Mike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike/ MIKE!" And calling the name of his man-of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">all-work, the professor ran out of the laboratory. Morely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  'Spiders like the ants anaesthetize their victims against the time when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they need them for food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear his voice resound throughout the house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then it came from the garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor left to his own devices, shrugged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, smiling a little to himself. He bent over a»d</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the fallen chair that lay against one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window flower-boxes. He dropped into the chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat there, his eyes ranging over the flower-boxes so</seg><seg type="columnLine">artfully arranged. Pains had been taken to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box appear like a Japanese garden with little men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, pretty bridges and what not set about among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plants. With the aid of a small mirror a lake had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been formed. A dragon fly hovered over some blossoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was the open door of an ant-hill to be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">templated by the entomologist. An ugly little weed</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his eye, and reaching down, he removed it. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something else that drew his wandering atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw a tiny, newly constructed spider's web stretch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing across two small ferns, amid a tangle of some more</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeds that had been neglected. He could make out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agitation of the web's tiny gwner, and, because his voca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was also his hobby, he drew out his magnifying glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see what troubled the tiny home-maker. He brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it close to the scene, taking place there among the weeds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a whistling exclamation escaped his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment Professor Trent reentered the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-talking to himself. "Can't find that confounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow anywhere, or his wife either. Well, of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankety-blank . . ." Coming in through the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">window he had not noticed where he was going and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air was suddenly blue, as the man of science shook water</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his shoes. He had stepped on the edge of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fallen water cans, tipping the remaining water over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dune, old man, come here.

He saw an incredibly tiny man</seg><seg type="columnLine">battling what to him must have seemed a monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider, while in a cocoon in the spider's web hung an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysterical woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Good Lord!

But whatever possessed Mike to . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morely interrupted as he drew forth a pair of pincers</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an inner pocket. "No matter why they're there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've got to rescue them. He'd never kill that spider with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that straw!" As he spoke, he picked the spider from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nest with his pincers and crushed it. "A piece of paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">please," he added to Trent as carefully now he drew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threads of the spider silk away from around the woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few moments later, he was placing the frightened, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most microscopic woman on the broad expanse of white</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper Trent had brought. The man was placed beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman and under the magnifying glass, the two saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny man take the woman's fainting form into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carefully transferring the paper to a table-top nearby,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor looked at Trent with twinkling eyes. "In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dubitably, my friend, your new rays are a success, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you the means of returning these unusual speci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mens of homo sapiens to their original size?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will be simple. You see, I perfected the s-ray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or enlarging ray, before I ever thought about this reduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ray at all. In fact, the t-ray is simply a by-product</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the s-ray I have already mentioned to you. But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO FOUGHT A FLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">619</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't understand, is what led Mike to do such a thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's a steady sort of a fellow. Never did a prank like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this before in his life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morely inclined his head toward the spilled watering</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans. "I'd hardly attribute this 'prank', as you call it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man. According to the position of the ray-lamp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chair and that can over there, I should suppose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was in the act of rescuing his wife when he fell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying everything to the floor with him. You see . . ."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"By George, you're right. But Mary is supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">never to come in here. She has none of the intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence of Mike, and I don't like her fussing around in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my laboratory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Has she a touch of rheumatism or something of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, perhaps. I've never inquired," said Trent</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffly, not seeing where this questioning was leading to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But haven't you noticed, my friend, that you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted the t-ray apparatus in a lamp shade similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those sold on the market for dispensing the beneficial</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-violet ray? If I'm not mistaken, there's its mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the comer!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By George, that is a sun-ray lamp over there.

I see it 4lll now. Here, help me rig</seg><seg type="columnLine">up this s-ray paraphernalia. Better put them on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, hadn't we?" As the pair discoursed, Trent had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been putting together an odd-looking machine with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he intended to "bring back" Mary and Mike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was a matter of minutes before the now uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious man and woman were almost back to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">original size- Morely watched them grow with a scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific eye, exclaiming at their rapid return to normalcy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticing that as they grew larger their bodily growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to slow down correspondingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There," exclaimed Trent, "that seems to be about</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. I think that is Mike's normal size. Don't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a giant of him," and he turned off the red ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the apparatus from the pair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morely sucked in his breath. "Your man looks like</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much of a tramp, Dune. I think he might shave</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally. And what a slattern his wife is." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair still under the coma induced by the ray, could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear his biting slander.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that ? Why, they are a sight, aren't they ? But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike was clean-shaven this morning, and I've never</seg><seg type="columnLine">before seen Mary with a hair out of place, let alone a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soiled apron. By George, of course. Let me see. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember I said the bulb of the t-ray was still warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I picked it up. That means that they were under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the influence of the ray not ten minutes before we ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared on the scene, but think of it, Yo, those two had</seg><seg type="columnLine">endured all sorts of hardships in that few minutes. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems minutes to us must have been days, if not weeks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them in their reduced state, for naturally with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduction of size, came the speeding up of heart-beats</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of bodily actions. That accounts for Mike's un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaven appearance. And look, how tired and haggard</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looks. I bet he's lost some weight, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Quiet, Mike's coming out of it." That was Morely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A deep groan came from the man on the floor. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">winked his eyes against the light, closing them quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">again as if it made him dizzy. But he opened them</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly, and tried to sit up. Trent said not a word as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted the man to get his bearings. Now the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was moaning, making mumbling sounds under her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morely helped Mike to sit up, feeling his pulse as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so. The man became aware of those administering</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, tried to get to his feet. "Take your time, Mike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's all right," put in Trent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was some time before the pair were fully cognizant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their surroundings, however. Trent and Morely had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten Mary to a couch against a far wall, and left her</seg><seg type="columnLine">there to recover by herself; then they were helping Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">to orientate himself once more. But gradually it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming back to him. He wanted to speak, and, after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had insisted upon him seating himself in the chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morely had quitted earlier, he began to talk, first in dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jointed sentences, then more rationally, and they heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">his story as he relived his experiences of the past ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes or so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the middle of the telling he suddenly drew in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath sharply. "The spider--you saved Mary and me</seg><seg type="columnLine">from, sir?" That part seemed vague to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll tell you about that later," observed Trent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell us all you remember from the beginning while</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's still alive in your mind. Do you recall everything?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything, sir. It's all clear now.

She's had a touch of neuritis, though I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her she wasn't to use your sun-ray light for it. Well,:</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was late in watering the flowers, and I came in to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sitting under your new-ray lamp, shrinking . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, what did you do when you saw her under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew immediately that she had switched lamps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir. I dropped my cans and made a dash for her, only I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have tripped and the next thing I knew I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting in the middle of a red plain . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A red plain ?" The professor stared at the floor, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face bright. "You mean one of those tiles there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir, I was in the middle of one of those red tiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it looked like a vast plain, all rough and hilly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I stood up, a could see the blue plains beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracks. Then I saw a great leaning pillar, Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heavens, sir, that must have been a leg of this very chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which I'm sitting," and he went on to describe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of the "pillar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From this point Mike told the whole story, his dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery of the transparent spheres in the first coulee, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight with the fly, the strange stream of water, the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of the caterpillar, et cetera. The others heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">him through to the end, and now Mike insisted on rising,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and placing the chair as it was when Morely found it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They located the exact spot where the chair leg had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, when the body of the dead fly was found unmo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lested where it had fallen, and there was still a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickle of water in the "canyon" where he had found his</seg><seg type="columnLine">"lake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's one of the things I could not understand, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the queer action of the water. I seemed to know it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, and yet it acted so strangely . . ." and he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained about the surface skin of the sphere and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"river."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Trent explained to him the law of capillary attraction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">together with the law of expansive forces. The body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, which Mike discovered in the cement between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">620</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tiles, lay on an absorbent substance, therefore, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges had appeared conclave, although had it been an</seg><seg type="columnLine">non-absorbent substance, it would have appeared just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite. The surface tension of the "skin" was due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the molecular forces in liquids, that tend to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">about cohesion of all parts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And those spheres that grabbed me up and then ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Water droplets, nothing less. You'd just finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">mopping the floor, you know, and those droplets had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet evaporated. When they did evaporate into vapor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expansion force produced your 'terrific explosion.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, there were those falling particles in the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first they were troublesome, but beyond the chair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg, the fall was lessened, until I reached the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mount--er flower-box."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They were dust-motes, Mike.

Under the microscope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these dust motes appear to consist of organic, mineral</seg><seg type="columnLine">and metallic particles.

Morely plucked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny plant and put it away carefully for later analyses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Next, they found Mike's ledge and the ant-hill entrance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They even saw an ant on duty at the entrance. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">man spoke when Mike put out his finger and squashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little beast. It was revenge!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed when he saw the wilderness through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had wandered. The statue was one of the Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">statesmen he himself had put in place. And the mirror</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused him to chuckle. How it had fooled him! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what idiots he had thought the giants were, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed a bridge over the imitation lake! And his trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the small plants he had set out. Had he but cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">away those tiny weeds yesterday, he would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had such a struggle through the morass to get to Mary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shreds of the spider web were found scarcely two inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Mirror Lake.

He told Mike what the tiny creatures were to whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he owed his life. It was Trent, however, who brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a point in Mike's story that seemed most puzzling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It seems strange, Mike," he observed, "that you ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to have no cognizance of the fact that you had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so reduced in size. You speak of your adventures</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if you imagined you had been transplanted to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange land with only the hazard, unreal remembrances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your true life. Surely that crack on your head wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait, Dune, I think I could explain that better," put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Morely. "It's this way. 'By rather elaborate alge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">braic calculations, Cuvier and Eugene Dubois, the learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">physiologist, celebrated for discovering the Pithecan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thropus of Java, when he was in the Colonial service</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, afterwards Professor in the University of Am-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sterdam, have established the fact that the specific brain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of a species of animal cannot fall below a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportion in relation to the weight of the body, if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal intelligence of the species is to be maintained!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Among the monkeys, which are the most intelligent group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anthropoid mammals, the individual cannot be smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">than an ouistit, which has a brain one twenty-iourth the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of his total body-weight of ten and one-half</seg><seg type="columnLine">ounces. Imagine this monkey one-third the size and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">find that he will need a brain one-sixteenth of his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enjoy the same degree of intelligence. On the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, less intelligent animals, like certain insectivora,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a weight of barely one-tenth of an ounce and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain one-fortieth their weight, which is sufficient for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their slight mental activity. By the same calculation, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is shown that a man to possess average intelligence, can</seg><seg type="columnLine">not weigh less than thirty-three and a half pounds.' "*</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now in Mike's case, his reduction in size meant a</seg><seg type="columnLine">relative loss of brain-activity, thereby giving him just</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough intelligence to safeguard him in the new world</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found himself in, and of consequence memory and</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructive, rational thinking were practically beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinj^ He could name things he saw, because they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so thoroughly impressed upon his brain, but when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to use his thinking processes, they simply rebelled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was more animal than man, unable to hold to abstract</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought-process long enough to comprehend things</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly.

He was, however, enough man to hold to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his original purpose once it developed in his dulled brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was also the sub-conscious desire for his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind; as he has already told you, this thought reoccurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">at intervals. That was the reason he could not visualize</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary or remember her clearly until he actually came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical contact with her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ah, but Mary remembered Mike.

His cuts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bruises needed immediate attention.

BAMONT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KEMPTON had just witnessed the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most spectacular fire of its history.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some twenty years ago, the Keystone Mill</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the largest planing-mill and wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">working establishment in the Susquehanna</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley. Now the red demon of destruction had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">along and, in a few hours, had reduced it, from a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-story frame building covering a whole city block,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a vacant square, littered with charcoal, brick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other debris. For the last six years it had been aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doned and all its machinery and equipment had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed. The land that it occupied was of low realty</seg><seg type="columnLine">value, and this, along with its huge size and dilapidated</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition, made it a white elephant in the hands of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">late owner, Colonel Jackson. When the Colonel died</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years ago, he left this property, along with another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller, abandoned factory, to his son, Horace Jackson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jr. After his father's death, young Jackson made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of unsuccessful attempts to sell these properties,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then had left town, and nobody had heard anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him since.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, one night, the Keystone Mill had burned in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most spectacular way. A patrolman, going his rounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had discovered a small blaze down in one corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first floor. By the time he had rushed around the corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an alarm box and back again, the whole first floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one side was burning in a number of places. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later, when the apparatus arrived, almost half</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building was in flames. With such a start, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no chance of saving the place, and most of the efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Fire Department were directed towards soaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearby houses to protect them from flying sparks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brands. Of course, in such a weather-beaten and dilap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idated structure, a fire would spread only too quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in this case it spread so fast that it seemed to fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump along! As patrolman McGuirk later remarked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief: "Why, you'd see part of the old place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there wasn't any fire or sparks at all, mebbe forty or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty feet from the nearest place that was blazin' . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">look back there a few seconds later and you'd see enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames to swear there had been fire there for five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly before the ruins were cold, an investigation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in progress. Chief Anderson of the Fire Depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and Elliot, Captain of Detectives, had secured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">services of two deputies from the State Fire Marshal's</seg><seg type="columnLine">office at Harrisburg. The two insurance companies also</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent a number of investigators to learn as much as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could about the whole business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They took up the problem from all sides, and carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the investigation as far as they could, but no tangible</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence as to the cause of the fire, was forthcoming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About all they had succeeded in doing was to convince</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves that it was a case of arson. But, as to how</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was done, they had not the faintest idea.	•</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suspicion, of course, pointed at once to Young Jack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. But practically nothing was known about him or</seg><seg type="columnLine">his whereabouts. Rumor had it that he was engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some post-graduate work in a western university at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time of his father's death. Somehow, the family</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune had diminished and when the Colonel's will was</seg><seg type="columnLine">read, it was found that little remained besides the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keystone Mill and a smaller abandoned factory up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyoming Street. Young Jackson, a tall, lanky and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean shaven individual, had immediately sold the family</seg><seg type="columnLine">mansion and then tried to dispose of the two factory</seg><seg type="columnLine">properties. In this he was unsuccessful and a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time later he left town. Where his income came from,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he did or where he was, nobody knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ruins of the mill had been thoroughly and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peatedly searched for any clews or evidence, but noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of a peculiar or suspicious nature was found, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of what appeared to be small glass marbles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a grayish-blue color. These seemed harmless enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">and surely didn't look like the parts of any "infernal</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine." But the fact of their being found in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, at such a time, gave rise to some conjecture among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the investigators. Finally, out of curiosity, more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything else, a few of these were sent to Harrisburg</seg><seg type="columnLine">for analysis. They were found to be composed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystalline quartz, with a slight percentage of carbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">impurities, to have a very high melting point and, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, they were incapable of any incendiary purposes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time the investigation had reached an impasse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The men from the insurance companies gave up the hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of getting any evidence and left town to locate young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson, who, from what information was available,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be traveling somewhere in the south. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two deputies from Harrisburg also gave up the case for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time being, and left for parts unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW, one Saturday morning, about three weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the fire, Captain Anderson and Chief Elliot</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the Captain's office, going over the case again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Chief," said Captain Anderson, thoughtfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">chewing an unlighted cigar, "the insurance was all in</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Jackson's name, so he's the only one to gain by</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. He's supposed to be out of town, but what's to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from sneakin' back here and firin' the place? Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when everything's quieted down, he'll come back to col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lect his money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mebbe so," grunted Chief Elliot, "but how you gonna</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove it? Nobody saw him around . . . even the insur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance people haven't found him yet, and, you can bet</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, if he did do it, he'll have a mighty good story</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooked up by the time they find him. What's more;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">623</seg><seg type="columnLine">624</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">what evidence have you ? So far, you have nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicions!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, ... we still have those funny little blue mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles, or whatever they are," mused the Captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bunk! Why it's ridiculous to think that those quartz</seg><seg type="columnLine">balls could burn down a building! Even if they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">have something to do with it, how're you gonna prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">that young Jackson, or anyone else, for that matter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the . . . ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah, I know," interrupted the Captain, "but just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same, I'd like to know more about those little blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">pills. ... By the way, remember Professor Clark . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">physics teacher up at the High School ? I've mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to you before. He's the fellow who helped me out</seg><seg type="columnLine">oji that dope case last year. Just a young fellow, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe me, that fellow sure knows his science. Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's no dub at practical, commonsense reasoning. Seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get a huge kick out of playing the amateur detective</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then. Anyhow, I thought I'd see if he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">help us out, so I gave him a ring and told him to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">around here this morning as I had another little prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem for him to exercise his cranium on. . . . He ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be here any minute now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Humph!" grunted Chief Elliot, "lotta good that'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. But I suppose we can let him have a few of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">little balls to play with . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come in!" barked the Captain as a knock sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the door. ".'Morning Clark!" he addressed the so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phisticated-looking young man who had just entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office. The captain introduced Chief Elliot to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor, sat down, and then began:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Professor, you've probably read the accounts</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the local papers about the fire at the Keystone Mill</seg><seg type="columnLine">a month or so ago?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah," drawled Professor Clark. "Saw the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from beginning to end. I happened to be in the neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">borhood when the alarm struck, so I dashed over. Acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty funny, didn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's just it," replied the Captain. "Now to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long story short, we're almost sure it was a case of</seg><seg type="columnLine">arson, but we have no clue or evidence as to how it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done . . . except, maybe these:" he said, as he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the desk and handed the professor a cigar box full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the small quartz spheres. We sent some of these to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harrisburg for analysis and they were found to be com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed of crystalline quartz with a trace of carbon im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">purities. Of course, we don't know that they had any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to do with the fire. All we got is the suspicion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that naturally arises from finding such things in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. What we want you to do, is to take these things</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with you and find out if there is any possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">way in which they could be used for incendiary pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses ; and if so, how."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rather a stiff order, eh?" mused Professor Clark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he closed the cigar box. "By the way, young Horace</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson owned the place, didn't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh-huh," replied the Captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hasn't been in town lately, has he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not to our knowledge. Insurance people haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">even found him yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So-o-o!" drawled the Professor. "You know, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be a bit surprised if these little spheres should</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn out to be the clue you're looking for, Captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I quite realize that you want concrete facts. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great gulf fixed between ye humble clue and the evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence that convinceth the jury," he grinned. "Anyhow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll let you know as soon as I get any results," he said as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he took up his hat and his box of marbles, and departed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the next few days Captain Anderson often</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if there really was anything in the fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastic idea that those little spheres could have had any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to do with the fire at the Keystone Mill. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen or heard nothing of the Professor. Of course, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite evident that the solution of this mystery would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take time, so. . . . Well, the Professor had assured him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that as soon as he got some concrete evidence, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him know. But as the days went by and still noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was heard from the Professor, the matter slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his mind in the daily and nightly business of man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ipulating the long arm of the law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But one morning, on his way to the office, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">and talked to Chief Elliot of the Fire Department for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. The Chief was all steamed up about an acci-,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that had happened the day before. It seemed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of his pumpers had side-swiped each other up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norcross Street and 6th Avenue while answering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">false alarm. They were dented up rather well and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be out of service for two or three days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the captain sat down at his desk and reached for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bunch of reports, someone opened the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good morning, Captain!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So it's you, Professor," said Captain Elliot as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to greet the intruder. "Thought it was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my men who got here too early I Sit down and let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear about it. I suppose you came about our little mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery of the quartz balls?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," replied the Professor nonchalantly helping</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to one of the Captain's cigars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you learn anything from them, Prof?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you," asked the Professor, disregarding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief's question, "know that Horace Jackson owns any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more property here in town?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, yes," replied the Captain in a puzzled tone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He owns a small factory up on Wyoming Street next</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the P. R. R. freight yards. They used to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">novelty leather goods there. But it's been shut down</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the Colonel's death . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I know," interrupted the Professor, "but, is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">insured, and if so, how heavily?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh?" demanded the Captain. For a moment he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at the Professor, who was placidly smoking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar and gazing at the ceiling. Then he got up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his swivel chair and started towards a huge metal filing</seg><seg type="columnLine">case on the other side of the room. In a moment he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was back at his desk again with a bunch of papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are two fire insurance policies on the place,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remarked, glancing over one of the pages. "Both are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in five figures."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For a moment, the Professor continued to smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gaze at the ceiling. Presently he asked in a desul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory tone, "By the way, Captain, did you hear about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accident up at Norcross Street and 6th Avenue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yesterday ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh-huh," grunted the Captain, "but let's stick to . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Say! whatin'ell you drivin' at?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, use your imagination," replied Professor Clark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now suddenly alert and business like, as he rapidly con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued : "Now, I'll lay a wager, that if there's any more</seg><seg type="columnLine">arson around here soon, it's going to be tonight or</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow night. Believe me, the person who engineered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that job at the Keystone Mill is clever--damnably</seg><seg type="columnLine">clever! It was arson, aTi right, as you suspected. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">INFRA-CALORESCENCE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">625</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">know that now and can prove how it was done before</seg><seg type="columnLine">any court. Also, I'm morally certain who did it, but if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can catch this person red-handed, so to speak, it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">save a lot of time and miles of legal red tape. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">person made a mighty smooth job of it the last time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knows it. It worked so well that he'll probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">try it again, if he gets a good chance. And now, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those two pieces of fire apparatus out of commission</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another forty-eight hours or so, it would seem that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate is playing right into his hands. If he is the clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">plotter I think he is, he won't pass up this opportunity!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then the idea is to keep some of my men in, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the place up on Wyoming Street for the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days ?" asked the Captain as Professor Clark paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to relight his cigar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! They wouldn't find a thing or see a soul. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only good they'd do would be to turn in the alarm, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire did start," replied Clark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how is . . . ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What I want you to do," interrupted the Professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"is to get me an ordinary closed delivery truck.

"The person who</seg><seg type="columnLine">started the fire in the Keystone Mill wasn't in the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">or around it when he did it.

I think I know where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can get a truck," said the Captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a second, Captain. You'd better give the Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ring and have him expect a call to that place tonight</seg><seg type="columnLine">or tomorrow night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right! I didn't think of that," replied the Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he returned to the phone on his desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE leather goods mill was a three-story frame</seg><seg type="columnLine">building, some two hundred feet long and half as</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide. It was in the middle of the block between 9th</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 10th Avenues, while on the other two sides of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the Pennsylvania freight yards and Wyoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street. Across from it on Wyoming Street were small</seg><seg type="columnLine">shacks and frame buildings of the poorer class and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">about half-way down the block was a small twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four-hour-a-day "greasy spoon" restaurant that catered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the men from the freight yards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On both sides of the truck, in weather-beaten letters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was painted: Smythe and Son, Licensed Plumbers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The driver, in a dirty pair of overalls and a battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat, was busily engaged in puffing on a corncob pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and piloting the truck. Beside him, apparently half</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep, was another, just as seedy looking individual, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavy sweater and greasy cap. To any person who</seg><seg type="columnLine">might take the trouble to notice, the outfit presented all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appearance of Smythe and Son, licensed plumbers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning from a late, emergency job. But, inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck, instead of pipe, tools and such implements of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumbing fraternity, there were three men. In the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, hunched against the doors, were Captain Anderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one of his men. In the front part, directly behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the driver, sat Professor Clark who had on a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear-phones and was busily engaged in slowly turning two</seg><seg type="columnLine">dials on what appeared to be a small portable radio set</seg><seg type="columnLine">and direction finder. But instead of the usual loop</seg><seg type="columnLine">aerial, there was a very fine mesh wire screen, built in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the form of a parabolic reflector. Inside the reflector</seg><seg type="columnLine">were two stiff copper wires, each one about half an inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, mounted end to end and separated by a small glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulator. This arrangement was mounted much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the regular loop aerial and could be pointed in any hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zontal or vertical direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some time this strange outfit drove up and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wyoming Street and the intersecting avenues, never go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing more than a few blocks from the leather goods mill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Except a few men from the railroad yards, entering or</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the "greasy spoon" on Wyoming Street, nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks like your suspicions ain't so hot, Professor,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">drily grunted the Captain, scrooching around and trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find a more comfortable position in his cramped</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mebbe so," replied the Professor as he glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his watch. "Give 'em time. It's only a little after one</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . there's hours yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh!" snorted the Captain. "About another hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this and I'll be a cripple for life 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they were coming up 9th Avenue towards Wyo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming Street, a large moving van rumbled past them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned up Wyoming Street and ground to a stop in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the restaurant. As "Smythe and Son" passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, two tough looking characters emerged from its cab</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leisurely made their way into the "greasy spoon."</seg><seg type="columnLine">After the delivery truck passed it, the driver turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and gave the Professor an inquiring look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on a block or so, then turn around," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later they were again nearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">restaurant. Just after they had slowly passed the parked</seg><seg type="columnLine">van, a faint whistle came from the Professor's headset</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then just as suddenly it ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go down to the end of the block, then come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and park in front of that van!" quickly whispered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor to the driver. Then to the Captain: "They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it now! . . . Must be using a directed beam, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only get it for the space of ten feet or so!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time they were down near the end of the mill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and once more that peculiar whistle came out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor's headset.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seems to be turned on this end of the place now,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked the Professor. "It either comes from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">626</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">place where the restaurant is, or else from that big van</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They turned around and once more started up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. When they passed the lower end of the mill, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound was again heard, and as they neared the van,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it again suddenly stopped. As they passed the van and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled into the curb in front of it, the Professor removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his earphones and turned to the Captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's go! We'll see what's in that van first. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's nobody there, it's into the restaurant for us!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly the five men got out of the small delivery</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck and started towards the van. Inside the restau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rant, the two men who had left the van a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, could be seen at the bar, busily engaged in eating.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The waiter was at the far end of the room and had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back turned to the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the Professor and the four detectives neared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">van, a faint humming sound could be heard above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idling throb of the motor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's in the van!" whispered the Professor. "Sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a motor-generator outfit!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Captain directed one of his men to go into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">restaurant to keep an eye on the two drivers of the van</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to arrest them as soon as they started to leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Then the others silently and quickly went around</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the back of the van. The entire back end was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">up of a large double door and fastened by a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring latch with loops for a padlock, but fortunately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no such padlock was in place. Reaching up, the Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed the latch, gave it a tug and quickly threw back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two halves of the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just inside the door, on one side of the van, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark skinned and heavily bearded person, in the act of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising from a small folding chair. In front of him, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side, was what appeared to be a compact but</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceedingly powerful short-wave transmitter. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front part of the van was a large motor-generator set</seg><seg type="columnLine">busily humming away. The whole interior was brightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">illuminated by a small globe in the ceiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up with 'em and get tha'ell out'a there quick!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapped out the Captain. The tall, haughty looking indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual so addressed, stared for a second at the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">business-like automatics pointed at various parts of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">anatomy and then reluctantly started to get out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">van.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put the bracelets on him quick!" cried the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he jumped into the van and reached for a large knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch above the motor-generator set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's this little melodrama all about?" indignantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded the prisoner. "Can't a scientist carry out</seg><seg type="columnLine">some experiments with a portable radio set without.. . ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Save that for the Judge!" snapped the Captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I demand an explanation of this outrage! You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffer for this blundering," snarled the prisoner as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">handcuffs were deftly snapped on his wrists. "Just what</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you expect to charge me with ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That!" said the Professor, who had emerged from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the van and was now pointing towards the far corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mill. There, behind the first floor windows, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flickering rosy glow and already whisps of smoke were</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeping out around the windows and from between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boards of the frame walls! Just then, around the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the van, muttering and cursing, came the two previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupants of the restaurant with their hands above their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads. Directly behind them was the other officer with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an automatic in each hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick, Professor!" called the Captain, "into that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">restaurant and send in an alarm while we put these</seg><seg type="columnLine">babies in the van!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later, as the Professor dashed out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">restaurant, the big van was already slowly starting off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He made a wild dash for it and leaped into the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat beside the officer who was driving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everybody back there?" he puffed, jerking his thumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah!" grunted the officer. "Captain's probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">givin' 'em the third degree already But we gotta get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of this neighborhood fast! . . . I know the way some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those guys on the fire department drive, and with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">old barn, I wouldn't care to pass any of 'em!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning, the Professor went down to Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Anderson's office in the City Hall. When he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, the Captain and the Chief were engaged in deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Captain, did you learn anything from your</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners of last night?" said Professor Clark after he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had carefully selected one of the Captain's cigars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a thing!" replied the Captain "But first, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had better hear what the Chief has to say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just this, Professor," immediately began Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elliot: "Thanks to the tip you and the Captain gave us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we got to last night's fire before it had too much of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">start and got it under control and stopped it. After any</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, one of my men and myself always make a round</seg><seg type="columnLine">of inspection through the property. Of course, in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, I kept a sharp lookout for any of those little blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres. Well, we found some . . . and in the most sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificant places! For instance, we found a handful in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pile of old packing cases; some more in a scrap heap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper and rags . . . and so on. After the part that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had burned cooled off enough, we picked around among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the charcoal and what-not and were lucky enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a dozen or so more." The Chief paused as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached in his pocket and drew out a handful of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar little quartz spheres. "I've got a big box full</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at my office," he added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew they'd be found there," said the Professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but I'd like to know what your prisoners had to say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," growled the Captain, "the two drivers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">van said they didn't know a thing about it. They owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the van and did trucking and moving jobs. Late Thurs-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day afternoon, a stranger came into their office and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chartered their van for last night, gave them their</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions and paid them well. He said he was a scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist and that he wanted to carry on some experiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a portable radio. The pay was good and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't stop to ask questions about other people's business.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then when we got that far with our examination they</seg><seg type="columnLine">both started to holler for a lawyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The operator of the radio, or whatever it was, said</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name was Schuman and that he was a scientist ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perimenting with short-wave portable radios, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't know a thing about the fire until you pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out to him. Then he also started to bellow for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All our bluff and third degree stuff didn't phase any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the three a bit and they wouldn't say another thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An hour or so ago I had the Radio Engineer from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">local "half-pint" broadcasting station over here to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look at the apparatus in the van and to tell us what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought it was. He said he'd take an oath that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only a short-wave radio transmitter of exceptionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">high power and that its radiations were no more capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">INFRA-CALORESCENCE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">627</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of starting a fire than are the radiations of any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcasting station. So there you are . . . !''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh I I wonder what correspondence school that</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Radio Engineer' authority of your's graduated from,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">snorted Professor Clark. "Why, anyone who is ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quainted with radio transmitters, could see at a glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that that oufit was far from an ordinary short-wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitter! Anyhow, that's beside the point at pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent. I wonder, Captain, if you would let me have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little private chat with the operator of this 'ordinary'</seg><seg type="columnLine">short-wave transmitter? I think I can inject a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">verbal stimulant that will greatly increase the vocal</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowess of your bearded law-breaker," grinned Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor Clark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Captain thoughtfully frowned for a moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then arose. "All right, then, come on!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly the three men made their way to the elevator</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thence to the basement, where there was a cell block</seg><seg type="columnLine">for prisoners awaiting hearings. A moment later the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain unlocked the door of the cell in which the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erator of the strange radio set was temporarily board-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Professor Clark nonchalantly strolled in, left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door ajar and sat down on the three-legged stool. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain and Chief Elliot took their stand farther down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corridor where they could keep a sharp lookout,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they were not quite near enough to hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered conversation within the cell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For half an hour the Professor remained in the cell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Chief and Captain Anderson impatiently shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one foot to the other and watched the prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke Professor Clark's cigarettes as he talked. Finally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Clark slowly rose and started for the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as he was out in the corridor, the Captain re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked the door and enquiringly turned to the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get anything out of him?" he asked as they went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the corridor to the elevator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's willing enough to talk now, and tell you what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want to know," replied the Professor. "But, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">can wait. But if you two gentlemen have an hour or</seg><seg type="columnLine">so to spare, I wish you'd come up to the High" School</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me. Nobody's around Saturday mornings, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll have the place to ourselves. There I will give you</seg><seg type="columnLine">the explanation to this little mystery of yours . . . and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a practical demonstration."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOME fifteen minutes later, the three men were as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled in the physics laboratory of the Senior High</seg><seg type="columnLine">School. Chief Elliot and the Captain, each perched on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those high back-breaking laboratory stools, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectantly watching the Professor as he fumbled among</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bunch of papers in a desk drawer. Presently he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he wanted and tossed a sheaf of papers upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaning back in his chair, he announced, "There's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete written report of my findings in this case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, by the way, were confirmed in every detail some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen minutes ago, by your prisoner, who is none other</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Horace Jackson, Jr. 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh?" exploded the Captain, "Is that young Jack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son I got back there in the jug?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None other! The dark skin and the brush works were</seg><seg type="columnLine">temporarily assumed to fool anyone who might recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nize him and to befool any wary minions of the law</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he might accidentaly stumble across," grinned Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Clark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Prof, how did you find that out ... ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't I tell you that I got him to confess?" inter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rupted the Professor calmly as he lighted a cigarette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah, but what's ... ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now just wait a second and I'll start from the begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning," said the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was probably just a lucky guess, or maybe, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those intuitive 'hunches' you hear about, that gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the key to this mystery. When you gave me those</seg><seg type="columnLine">little spheres, I noticed at once that they were of a blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">color. Crystalline quartz is white, or rather, colorless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like glass. Undoubtedly the blue color was due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carbon impurities. Was the quartz fused by the heat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire so as to mix with the carbon from charcoal?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardly! No such.fire could be hot enough to melt quartz.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What's more, this was in a crystalline form and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused. Besides, crystals don't grow in spherical forms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hence they must have been mechanically ground to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, I was taking for granted, for the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">being, that these spheres did have something to do with,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or were the cause of, the fire. These thoughts flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through my mind in the few seconds I was looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them. Then I suddenly remembered that any body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when cold, absorbs the same waves that it will emit</seg><seg type="columnLine">when heated. The spheres were blue, therefore they</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed the shorter waves. That was the idea that put</seg><seg type="columnLine">me on the right track. It didn't explain the fire by any</seg><seg type="columnLine">means, but it pointed out a line of investigation and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment to follow. Then, in a hazy way, I saw how it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might work out. After a lot of experimenting, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that my idea was right." The Professor paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, tossed his cigarette into a nearby sink and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then went on:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The thing as a whole is simple enough, but the actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracing out of the process, step by step, each grounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon facts and proof that would hold before a court of</seg><seg type="columnLine">law, was another matter entirely. I'll try to explain it</seg><seg type="columnLine">as briefly as I can, but in order to show you how it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, I'll have to digress into the realms of physics</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a bit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To begin with, we know that electric waves, heat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">light and so on, are only waves or vibrations in the ether,,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and differing from each other only in wave-lengths or</seg><seg type="columnLine">size, and in frequency or rate of vibration. As the wave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">length is shortened, the frequency becomes higher, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vice versa, according to the simple formula:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                 300,000,000</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wave-length in meters =-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                Frequency in seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the use of this formula, we can arrange a long table</seg><seg type="columnLine">of etheric vibrations, which you can think of as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">music for the keyboard on some huge piano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Way down at the bass end of the scale are those</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge electro-magnetic waves used for trans-oceanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">wireless communication. These are anywhere from</seg><seg type="columnLine">about 25,000 to 5,000 meters long. By the way, a meter</seg><seg type="columnLine">equals aproximately 39.37 inches. As we go up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">keyboard a little, we come to those familiar waves used</seg><seg type="columnLine">in radio broadcasting, and going down to about forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">meters in length. Next come those very short radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves that are being experimented with so much at</seg><seg type="columnLine">present. These short radio, or Hertzian waves, go from</seg><seg type="columnLine">about forty meters down to about one meter and less.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Continuing on up our keyboard, we find shorter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter Hertzian waves. The very shortest of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a length of about one-tenth of a millimeter. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">go just a few 'notes' higher until we come to waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">about .067 millimeters long. Here, instead of 'radio'</seg><seg type="columnLine">628</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">waves, we have waves that we can perceive with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses. In short, heat waves. These take up quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">space on our keyboard and go from about .067 milli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meters in length down to about .0008. Going just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little higher up the scale, we come to waves about .00068</seg><seg type="columnLine">millimeters long. Here another remarkable change takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. The waves become visible to us as red light! As</seg><seg type="columnLine">these get shorter, we go through all the colors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectrum until we reach the extreme of visibility in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet waves about .00043 millimeters in length. Beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, the ultra-violet is next, and so on. You can readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">see by our formula that the frequencies of heat and light</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves are really tremendous. So it will be easier to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak of them in terms of wave-length rather than in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequencies, although it may make my explanation a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">more involved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now I must add a few words on the general struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of .matter and its reaction to these etheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves. Take, for instance, a solid body. It is made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an almost countless number of minute bodies called</seg><seg type="columnLine">molecules. These molecules do not touch each other, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">are held together at varying distances by the forces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">attraction and repulsion and hence, are capable of vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. In crystalline substances they are arranged in cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain definite geometrical patterns. How rigidly these</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces hold them together depends, in a very general way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the properties of the body and the condition it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">under, such as heat or electrical influences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These molecules, in turn, are built up of a relatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">small number of still smaller things called atoms. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms in each particular kind of molecule are arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in definite patterns, somewhat analogous to the arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of molecules in crystals. They can also vibrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the molecule, even as the molecule vibrates as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole within the solid. Now even the atoms are made</seg><seg type="columnLine">up of still smaller divisions. Some of these, called elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trons, and protons (which are positive electrons) are also</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of vibration within the atom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is evident that the vibration of each molecule will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be slower and hence have a longer wave length than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the atoms within the molecules. Also, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration of the electrons in the atom will be more rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that of the atom as a whole. In a very general way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a substance is exposed to heat waves, the molecules</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrate integrally. When still shorter heat waves are</seg><seg type="columnLine">applied the atoms vibrate within the molecules while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">molecules themselves are in vibration, and as still shorter</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves, such as light, are applied, the electrons vibrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the atoms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any body capable of vibration has a fixed rate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequency. What this frequency is, depends upon a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of factors which I don't have to mention here. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed rate or frequency is called the fundamental. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">a body is vibrating at its fundamental, it is vibrating as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole. Now, under certain conditions, it may be vibrat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at its fundamental and yet be divided into aliquot</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts, which in turn, are vibrating within the body. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member how the atoms vibrate within the molecule, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the molecule itself is vibrating? Secondary vibrations</seg><seg type="columnLine">are called overtones or harmonics and their frequencies</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear a simple numerical relation to the frequency of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fundamental. For instance, call the fundamental fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quency two. The second harmonic (the first, really) of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, would have a frequency of four; the third, eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so on. These overtones also produce many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequencies amongst themselves, due to interference and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beats. Also, under certain conditions, a very strong</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">harmonic may become the fundamental for still higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmonics. In a general way, the number of overtones</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced, largely depends upon the strength or energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fundamental.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now let's apply this to the structure of matter in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid body. Suppose a very strong, and rather long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat wave strikes this body that has the right properties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What happens ? . . . The molecules will vibrate integrally</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the fundamental frequency of the heat wave, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms within the molecules will vibrate at harmonic fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quencies to this and will produce more heat waves, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a higher frequency. If the fundamental is strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, the electrons within the atoms will vibrate at</seg><seg type="columnLine">still higher overtones and produce light! This action</seg><seg type="columnLine">of changing heat waves into the shorter waves of visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">light is called calorescence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now if you remember, I said before that in crystals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the molecules are grouped into geometrical patterns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much like atoms are arranged to form molecules.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is quite obvious that even a small crystal is far too</seg><seg type="columnLine">large to vibrate as a whole to any heat wave. But, here's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange thing about it; some crystals, if carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground to the correct size, will vibrate when subjected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to radio waves! This is a well-known fact and is being</seg><seg type="columnLine">made use of in the broadcasting stations. The crystals</seg><seg type="columnLine">are used as frequency regulators to produce a steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwavering frequency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose we have a crystal of this kind and cut it</seg><seg type="columnLine">down until its fundamental corresponds to a very short</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave length. Then expose this crystal to a very strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiation of the same frequency. The crystal will then</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrate as a whole to this frequency, while the molecules</seg><seg type="columnLine">and atoms will vibrate to the higher overtones of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fundamental. The crystal will now be radiating heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves of many different frequencies. In short, we put</seg><seg type="columnLine">a radio wave into the crystal and got a whole flock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat waves out of it! If the energy put into the crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">is sufficient and the molecular and atomic structure is of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right type, the crystal will also emit light waves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we have an incandescent body, whose light and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat is produced wholly by our radio wave!" The Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor paused for a moment, to light another cigarette</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then went on:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quartz is one of those crystals I have just been talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about. Now, here is where the real cleverness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these crimes comes in. Ordinary quartz crystals would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never produce heat waves, let alone incandescence, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted upon by even an extremely powerful transmitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">at such distances as a few hundred feet. The loss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy would be entirely too great for one thing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystal would only vibrate at its fundamental along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first few harmonics, which would only give more</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio waves of a shorter length. All the received energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be frittered away in these low harmonics and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be none left to activate the very high ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would produce the heat and incandescence. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">simplest theoretical way to overcome this difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be to cut out the low and useless harmonics, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing only the real high ones which are needed. You can</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily see that, in practice, this would be an almost im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible undertaking. But, this is exactly what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">genius who committed your crimes did!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I carefully analyzed some of those little spheres and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as your report said, found them to-be composed of quartz</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a slight percentage of carbon. But, a real careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">analysis proved that the carbon used was an isotopic</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, hitherto unknown. This isotope had an atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">INFRA-CALORESCENCE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">629</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of exactly eleven, while the regular carbon atom</seg><seg type="columnLine">has an atomic weight of 12.005. By adding a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">percentage of this peculiar kind of carbon to the quartz</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some unknown way, a crystal was produced, that when</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground down to the right size, would give a few very</seg><seg type="columnLine">high harmonics of great strength. These, in turn, also</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted as the fundamentals for another group of over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones necessary to produce the incandescence. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of a very powerful transmitter with a narrow highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">directional beam, enough energy was received by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystals, within the buildings, to produce the calculated</seg><seg type="columnLine">results. . . . So, there you are. The rest is rather self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanatory now, isn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chief Elliot and the Captain, incredulous amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">written all over their faces, sat there staring at the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure listens all right, Prof. . . . but I'd . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like to see a demonstration?" interrupted the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor.

A loud humming sound became</seg><seg type="columnLine">audible and two large vacuum tubes began to glow. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a better look at what might happen, the Captain got</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from his stool and leaned over the table, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the Professor and his apparatus.

The one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left of the doorway was asleep. His negligence had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been observed by the girl several nights previously. Fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen paces to the right of the cell door was another, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant warrior standing motionless and alert. So much</seg><seg type="columnLine">could the girl see from behind the barred door of the cell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She grasped one of the steel bars in her slender hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced herself, and pulled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the earth-identity Laura Ives had been trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to the Venerian body of Izanne, she had gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">supernormal strength, as had the Venus-girl who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken her body on earth and had slain her brother. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy steel bar bent as she strained at it. Three minutes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of effort--effort that drenched her with sweat, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had torn the bar out of its steel sockets. The noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened the nearer guide, but before he could gather</seg><seg type="columnLine">his senses, the girl had swung the heavy bar on his skull</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stepped out through the gap. -The warrior to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right of the doorway ran up in a second, followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">those beyond him in the corridor.

It struck across his ankles, breaking them both.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went down and the one nearest behind him fell over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body. As she ran, a strange exultation seized her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving wings to her feet and redoubling her already su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhuman strength. In two seconds she saw her way</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocked by another guard, lifting his sword to throw. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had carefully planned her escape, and in the fraction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a split second she acted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She leaped completely over the astonished guard, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick of mind and muscle, the warrior turned in an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant and hurled a gleaming weapon after the fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Izanne. It all but missed her, yet cut a sharp, clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound in her shoulder as it hurtled by. Painful, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not serious; and it left a trail of blood drops behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before any of the outwitted guards could follow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laura Ives had reached a junction of two corridors, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into a transverse passage. In five minutes she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had outwitted and outrun the warriors, and had gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the traffic corridors. Here, feeling herself momentarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe, she had paused to gain breath, and she first noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wound. Few Corians were abroad at this hour, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally a citizen passed without giving her more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a casual glance. Conscious now of the throbbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain, she made her way toward the upper levels, walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboriously up the long ramps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After half an hour of fruitless search, the guards had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the blood trail. An alarm was broadcast to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cor. Slowly the guards followed the trail of blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drops, but they were few and far between. By dawn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire city was on the watch, and the trail had been fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed all the way to the topmost level. Here the search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers lost the trail. It was suggested that the girl might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have managed to elude the guards and steal a plane. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">every sky boat was in its place, and the guards of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper level denied the possibility of anyone eluding them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reaching a plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She could not have left Cor, therefore she was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the city, said the officials, but, unfortunately, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not find her.

When I photomapped Venus a few years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago with the hypertelescope, I located two immense cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters of activity--cities, we may as well call them, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">each is enormously larger than any terrestrial city--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. During the limited time, I was able to ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve them before the temporarily removed cloud-blanket</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet returned to stay, I saw and photographed</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplanes moving from one to the other. Each one is</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroqnded by jungle, they are some two hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so apart, and there is an enormous mountain barrier</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them, with a plateau, that, as far as I can tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the photographs, would be an ideal landing place</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rocket. It could not land in the thick jungles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I don't think it advisable to try to land too near</seg><seg type="columnLine">either of the cities, even if that were feasible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You intend to land on the plateau?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think it the best plan.

For a short time, about the fifteenth day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were making almost 500,000 miles per hour, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that point I slowly decelerated. At present we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving slowly, not more than a mile a second, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as we begin to notice the gravity of Venus, I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow down to 100 miles an hour.

An intelligent boy of sixteen, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that America was holding him as hostage because</seg><seg type="columnLine">America was desperate. America knew it could not hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">to withstand the onslaught of the yellow hordes. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">century America had known it.

Of course they were treating him well, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as a prisoner could be treated, but he could not com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municate with anyone.

Musing, and trembling a little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howard Fu-Zhse II turned over in his bed, snapped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light of his soundproof cell, and fell into a restlesd</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lee Chilton was wanted by the police for jail-break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.

The plain-clothes guards in the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">masking themselves as soon as the detector gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm, soon found that each of their masks was defective.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The alien brain had managed to bring that about, also, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clever interception and exchange of packages when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new masks were being sent to the house.

He did not take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance that his victim might survive.

The Dictator</seg><seg type="columnLine">of United Mongolia would strike to revenge. America</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be erased.

Chilton had</seg><seg type="columnLine">translated the welcome of the earthmen to him, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, of necessity, left the giant to his own resources.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shortly after the radio news-unit was through with Lee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meriden, in tremendous agitation, called him, pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the open door of the rocket. The sun was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting, but there was light to spare. In the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw an immense war-plane crossing the plateau a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scant three hundred feet above it, and they recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane for what it was ... the carrier of the ray that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made steel more fragile than glass. It was half way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sarvon. It would reach the city after dark, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city would collapse and carry its inhabitants down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, unless . . . unless they could prevent the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">from reaching Sarvon. Sarvon was not warned; even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it had been, it had no way of protecting itself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray. Sarvon was built of steel!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few seconds Lee Chilton had outlined the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to Boyd, who gave swift orders. One of the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-seated planes was brought from the cargo-room, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces which were rapidly uncrated. The sun was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">low in the sky. None of those in the rocket except Lee</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Meriden could dare to venture outside, but Lee Chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton knew terrestrial airplanes. With the giant's help he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">carried the uncrated units outside, and set to work as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembling them. Inside the rocket the highly-trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew, eager to assist, assembled the motor on a testing</seg><seg type="columnLine">block they had brought along, checked every adjustment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuned it up to perfection plus. And Meriden of Sarvon</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked into the rocket, picked up the efficient power unit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that three terrestrials could hardly have moved, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly carried it out to the almost assembled plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When they were done and ready to take the air, the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">was yet lower in the cloudy sky. In an hour or so it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lee waved to the watching crew and gave the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun. It disappeared in the clouds almost imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately in the direction that the feared plane from Cor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," said the bespectacled chemist to Burton</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boyd, "that the Venerians are immune to their destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive sunlight--a matter of acclimatization through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Boyd hardly heard him. "A flyer and a fighter,1*'</seg><seg type="columnLine">mused the detective. "I wish I were with them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fierce exultation gripped Lee Chilton. He was again</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying an earth-plane, a sleek little hawk with fangs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delicate directional sound-detectors enabled him to locate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and follow the enormous Corian plane in spite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog. The indicators told him that fie was gaining on</seg><seg type="columnLine">it ever so slightly. He opened the throttle to its ulti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate; the propeller seemed to bite into the fog; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaining on the monster now, but it was still twenty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, and making almost as good time as he was. Could</seg><seg type="columnLine">he catch it before its batteries and generators and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectors flashed that disintegrating ray on the helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure of Sarvon? He looked at his indicators again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked Meriden some questions about the relative</seg><seg type="columnLine">location of Sarvon. Yes, if nothing went wrong, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could catch the Corian plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Concisely, he instructed Meriden in the use of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns. The Sarvonian was quick to learn; but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never handled any bullet-projecting weapon in his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lee explained how to use the automatically self-correct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sights, how to start and stop the deadly hail of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosive bullets from the Marvite machine-guns. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">were concealed in each wing-tip; others were mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rim of the cockpit, controlled by hand. Lee re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gretted that he himself could not take over the guns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he knew that he would have his hands full handling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane. It would take some clever stunting to dodge</seg><seg type="columnLine">that beam of invisible rays. If it once touched the plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">said plane would fall to pieces right out from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Lee only hoped that the Corians would send a</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible light-beam along with the other. If they did, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be perhaps a little easier for them to aim at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrial ship, and it would also be easier for Lee to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodge. He fingered his parachute to reassure himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and instructed Meriden concerning his .. . needlessly, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant was fully aware of the functions of a para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The indicator needless of the sound-detecting appara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tus suddenly jumped. Lee had not altered his course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was already making his maximum speed. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only one explanation; the other plane had altered</seg><seg type="columnLine">its course. It took Lee about thirty seconds to discover</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely that the warplane was doubling back on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. He warned Meriden to be ready for immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">combat. The needles were approaching the limits of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dials; the other plane was getting close. Then the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">638</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tional apparatus showed the Earthman that the return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing monster was not coming exactly towards him, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps was not even aware of his existence! It was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the rocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was just setting. The fog was getting darker</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray. Blindly, Lee altered his own course to intercept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Corian plane. In a few minutes he thought he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, dimly, through the foggy mist. A short burst of bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets from one of Meriden's guns exploded against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">armored side of the warskyship from Cor. Beginner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck! It was several minutes before any of Meriden's</seg><seg type="columnLine">other attempts were successful, yet he was doing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">best to make his shots count, to wreck his enemy's plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save Sarvon. Meriden's first burst had injured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big plane only slightly. If it had hit the tail or wing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surfaces, things would have gone differently. It inflicted</seg><seg type="columnLine">only minor injury on the armor that guarded the vital</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of the ray-generator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Meriden's shots came close, and the Corians soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to realize that they were coming closer with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">second. The unwieldy Corian ship could neither out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance nor outmaneuver the terrestrial hawk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only at intervals was either plane visible from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Lee flew with seeming recklessness and with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparable skill, darting up to give Meriden a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the guns, flashing out of sight, literally flying circles</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the other. Meriden succeeded in getting in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct hit that jarred the Corians, but did not wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big ship. It held steadily on its course to the rocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were close to it now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A brilliant beam of light shot out from the Corian</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, seeking the small attacker. It seemed to be man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ipulated with incredible speed by some skilled operator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A burst of bullets from the grim giant in the front cock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit went wild. Meriden cursed his luck, for neither he</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor the cool Chilton knew, as they tried their level best</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring down the armored war-plane, of the unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">stowaway wedged between three fuel-tanks. Meriden's</seg><seg type="columnLine">first burst had jarred the plane, and the dark-eyed girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">had struck her head against one of the tanks, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumped down between them. She was momentarily safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">from discovery, yet if one steel-jacketed explosive bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">had penetrated one of those tanks. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lee banked suddenly to avoid that disturbingly quick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifty, brilliant beam of light, and circled around to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meriden another direct aim. The beam beat him to it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">framed the little plane in brilliance for one second. Noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing happened; evidently the steel-fatigue ray was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">being projected along with the searchlight. A continu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous stream of bullets was flashing from one of Meri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den's guns . . . somehow he had jammed a trigger. Lee</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung around again toward the weirl beam of light that</seg><seg type="columnLine">pierced the blackness. That stream of bullets shouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be wasted. Apparently Meriden couldn't stop the gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he swung into an advantageous position the supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cartridges gave out. Lee cursed from exasperation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet that circumstance had saved Izanne's life, at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a while. Lee Chilton didn't know that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the enemy ship. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great searchlight beam was pointing downward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Suddenly Lee got a glimpse of the immense Inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetarian, plainly revealed in spite of the fog, outlined</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the penetrating light. The character of the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed; an unpleasant metallic bluish tinge imbued it</seg><seg type="columnLine">now; and the great steel rocket suddenly collapsed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel had been rendered more brittle than glass by arti-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ficially produced steel-fatigue, a thousand times more</seg><seg type="columnLine">severe than the natural weakness that very rarely occurs</seg><seg type="columnLine">in steel structures after long use, the weakness called</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal-fatigue for lack of a better name or a better ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation. Sometimes it seems as if the steel had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown tired. The master scientists of Cor had learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to produce that same phenomenon, many thousand times</seg><seg type="columnLine">as complete. Their ray destroyed not the steel, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cohesion between the molecules of steel, so it crumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">like dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lee Chilton saw red. He was no longer a cool dare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil trying scientifically to obtain advantageous posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions for Meriden's guns. He was a madman determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to revenge the destruction of the rocket. He flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the fog within fifteen feet of the other plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meriden's guns were continuously going staccato, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was having some effect on the big plane. One wing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">damaged. .. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The searchlight found the little comet again, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it had that alien bluish tinge. The earthplane flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pieces just as an explosion rocked the Corian plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lee pulled the ripcord of his parachute as he had planned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do in case of emergency, devoutly hoping that Meri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den had remembered to pull his as per instructions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meriden had kept his nerve, however, and Lee saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly another billowing white mass close by. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were falling in almost the same path. Before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected it, Lee was bruised by sudden contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard rock. Meriden was close, and the earthman rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lized that they had landed on the plateau. Perhaps they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could join the rocket-crew, if any had escaped alive when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space ship had disintegrated. Di Bargi and Boyd</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be desperate. The Venus-day would come again</seg><seg type="columnLine">before many hours, and to terrestrials not actually pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessing Venerian bodies, sunlight meant death. . . . They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no shelter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meriden gripped his hand. Their comradeship had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown deeper during that battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At the very last," queried the giant, "you heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Your last shots must have been effective. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded like one of their fuel-tanks exploding. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably crashed somewhere below the plateau, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle. I saw a sheet of flame surround their plane."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sorry about your friends, Earthman, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will know the gratitude of Sarvon for that plane they</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave us.

To be sure, some fuel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks had exploded, some of the Corian crew had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed, yet the giant plane had not crashed. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">warplane, built for battle, built to withstand damage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was enough fuel left, and the ray-projector was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unharmed.

Surely Eenedar</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not speak so confidently if he were not sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. He had been to the earth, in an alien body, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigate conditions there. He was known as a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reliable scientist, so certainly his plan was worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Human life on the earth," (Eenedar commenced)</seg><seg type="columnLine">"has developed for ages under a very delicate cosmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance, a very exceptional corrfbination of circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances. The skins of terrestrials are very thin and deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate, in comparison to those of Venerians, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tissues are also more delicate in composition. We, on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, are accustomed to an intensity of sunlight, even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of the clouds, that terrestrials could not endure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Certain actinic rays which have only a beneficial effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us would be deadly to terrestrials. These rays are</seg><seg type="columnLine">always present in sunlight, but they do not reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrials because of a peculiar circumstance--the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of a small percentage of ozone in the upper atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere of the earth. This ozone acts as a filter, straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">out or eliminating the rays harmful to terrestrial life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is a very delicate balance. If there were more ozone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the earth's atmosphere, it would filter out the ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet rays, which are essential for life to exist, and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were a little less ozone in the atmosphere, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail to screen out the destructive actinic rays of the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By increasing or decreasing the ozone content of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's atmosphere, we can insure the death of every ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">restrial.

We can take possession forever of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">undamaged rich planet, and I assure you I have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of its incredible wealth. Our bodies are used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rays which will destroy the terrestrials. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just how do you propose to bring this about?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is very simple.

If you men have the nerve to climb down the vertical</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff____"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before dawn they were all safe in the cave in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lee Chilton had first met the Swordsman of Sarvon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lee and Meriden had gone down into the jungle beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in search of food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEFORE dawn the Corian warplane had passed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sarvon time and time again, and the invisible ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">had flashed down to the magnificent single structure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel, miles in each dimension, that was the city of Meri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">640</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">den. The Corians did not send a visible ray this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ray that destroyed. They did not need to see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delicate magnetic indicators enabled them to locate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city accurately, and they checked the needle's readings</seg><seg type="columnLine">with charts of the city's location. Six million tons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel cannot be hidden by darkness from a magic needle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down through the warm fog stabbed the steel-destroy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ray, and the murderous plane from Cor departed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness. Then a member of its crew discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Izanne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was bleeding from a jagged cut received from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragment of the fuel tank that had exploded. The frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment had gashed her left shoulder deeply from the front,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming very near to the subclavian artery. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">miraculously missed damaging any bone, but the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">was deprived of the use of the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The commander of the Corian plane, knowing how</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious the Council was to recapture the girl, ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surgeon of the warplane to give her the best of care.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He treated the ugly wound carefully, but he was unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring her back to consciousness. The disabled plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued toward Cor at half speed. News of its suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess was radioed to the Council of Nine. Planes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent from Cor to meet it with fuel and to take the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Cor as quickly as possible. The plans of Eenedar</seg><seg type="columnLine">were materializing with lightning speed. It would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of hours only before he would be ready to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a few men in the one completed rocket, fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped to navigate space and to destroy the ozone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. The other two space-ships would be ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry the bulk of the Corian population to the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the terrestrial hordes had been killed by the rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the violet. It was a matter of hours before Eenedar</seg><seg type="columnLine">left; and the Council intended to torture Izanne until</seg><seg type="columnLine">she divulged the secret in the notebook. Atomic power</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be useful to Eenedar, if they could obtain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">key to the cipher before the rocket left. The surgeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked unceasingly over the girl as the warplane headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Cor. She was breathing normally, but for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason Izanne did not return to consciousness. Outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was dark with the darkness that comes before dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was clever, Laura Ives. As a matter of cold fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was quite conscious for half an hour before the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geon knew it, and he only lived to know it for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">insignificant seconds. Her good right fist crashed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his skull with the uncanny superhuman strength she pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed, strength and power acquired with her transfer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies. She had patiently waited for her chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike; the surgeon had come too near, and had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">without even a gasp. Izanne rose from the table on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she had been lying and washed the blood from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fist in the surgeon's basin. She did not look again</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the man whose skull she had crushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Single-handed, literally single-handed, she set about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to capture the ten-ton warplane. Cold fury possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She had five men to deal with; the surgeon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the crew were dead. The commander, the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator, and three of the crew were left. She sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the radio-room first; it was nearest to the surgeon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cramped quarters. As she entered the room, the oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ator wheeled to face her. As he leaped, his hand on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the three swords always carried by Venerians, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl leaped too, avoiding the keen blade by inches, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one blow crushed the operator's skull. He fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">against her bandaged shoulder, bruising the wound, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of the pain, she took one of the swords and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed the instruments, cutting off all communication.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The noise was heard outside the radio-room. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments later the commander and another Corian en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered with drawn swords. Instinctively Izanne hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy, balanced blade from her hand. It buried it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to the hilt in the breast of the second Corian. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most at the same second the commander threw his sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the uncanny skill of the trained Venerian sword-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter. It did not wound her; the commander had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to touch her; but it passed so close to her side</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it pinned her clothing to the hardwood wall. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore she could disengage the torn tunic-like Venerian</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment, the commander, with an inscrutable smile, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding the point of another of his swords at her throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was captive again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Or at least, so the commander thought. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">live to think anything else. The anger that possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Izanne was not passionate; it was deliberate and cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and calculating. She knew of her supernormal strength,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she knew that the commander was in all probability</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant of it. She permitted him to bind her, broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cords and killed him when he was expecting no re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance at all. She found the remaining two of the Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ians together in the control-room, and killed on£ as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. She entered the room and used the point of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword to demand obedience from the one remaining Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian. At her direction, he headed the plane toward Sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">von ; but told her that there was not enough fuel left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the city, and that it had been destroyed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel-fatigue ray; whereupon she ordered him to land on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plateau between the two cities. This he did. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damaged plane jolted to a stop on the uneven rock, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurch jerked the frightened Corian pilot forward upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Izanne's already-reddened sword. For a few seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">she sat frozen, looking at the dying Corian. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaction came, and she covered her face with her good</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and burst into hysterical sobbing. She seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her slain brother's face. "Harry, old chap, I guess ...</seg><seg type="columnLine">I guess you're avenged, now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXVIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Retaliation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUST before dawn, Meriden had killed, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown sword, a fine buck of a species of Venerian</seg><seg type="columnLine">antelope, nocturnal in its habits. In the pale light</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and Lee were carrying the venison toward the cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they saw the immense Corian plane pass overhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and descend toward the plateau. It had seemed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eagerly they climbed to the cave with their burden</seg><seg type="columnLine">of meat, left it there with the cook of the Interplanetar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian's crew, and continued up the cliff to the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascent. It had been a fatiguing climb, even to them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sun was well up in the always-clouded sky when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw the plane, motionless. Cautiously, swords</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready, they approached it. There were no signs of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">on board the plane. They recognized it as the one they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been fighting in the early part of the night. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered it and foynd Izanne, crying a little in her weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was very beautiful to the two men who loved her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful in spite of her torn and blood-stained garments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each of the men stepped forward instinctively to lift her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his arms, and their eyes met coolly. Meriden and Lee</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SWORDSMAN OF SARVON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">641</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Chilton knew that they were rivals, and, according to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venus-code, rivals fought to the death. Yet they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were comrades. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four fast planes landed skilfully near the motionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">large one ... the planes sent from Cor with extra fuel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The commander of one of them had orders to bring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl to Cor. The twelve Corians from the planes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious. The warplane had suddenly ceased to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municate with Cor, and they had had a difficult search</seg><seg type="columnLine">before sighting it here on the plateau. They approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">it cautiously, swords drawn. Then Meriden and Lee</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chilton, attracted by the noise of the Corian planes, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared in the fuselage door of the large plane, and three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Corians recognized the Swordsman of Sarvon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then began the greatest fight of Meriden the Sarvon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian. Before that battle was over, each of his three</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaguar-hilted swords had drunk deep of blood, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own blood stained the rocks. One of the Corians had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reentered his own plane and radioed to Cor; the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleven had attacked the two in the doorway of the larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">skyship. And Meriden had leaped to the combat. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways at his side was the earthman Lee Chilton, hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a less formidable opponent than the giant, for Lee</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought with the fencing-technique of earth, unfamiliar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Corians, who, except when throwing them, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to using the edges of their swords rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the points . . . unfamiliar and deadly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Corians did not force the combat. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of time, and they were numerically superior.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Working systematically in shifts of four, they under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">took to exhaust their two enemies. Twelve of them there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, and when four were tired, four fresh and rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">swordsmen took their places, but the two who were pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tecting Izanne had not a minute's respite. Neverthe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, the Corians made one fatal mistake. They jeered</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Meriden and boastingly told him of the fate of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. It drove the giant mad. In a minute and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">he killed three of his opponents. The others retreated to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward their planes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they did so, they seized the opportunity to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">swords, which they had not dared to do previously for</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of hitting their own comrades. Meriden could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurl swords too. In this way he wounded another Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian enough to keep him out of the battle, and he acquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">his third wound of this particular battle. Lee Chilton</seg><seg type="columnLine">had five, but only one of them was at all serious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the Corians were succeeding. It was easy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that Meriden needed a rest desperately. The eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corians determined not to give him a second to recover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crowded around the two to finish them. Lee and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meriden backed toward the warplane. A scratch on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant's forehead was bleeding freely, and the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">was getting into his eyes. His breath came in enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">choking gasps. The eight enemies were confident now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had won. Meriden took a second to wipe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood from his eyes with the back of his hand, and in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">second Lee, with a sword in each hand after the Vener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion fashion, stepped in front of the giant and protected</seg><seg type="columnLine">him until he could see again; then for a while they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting back to back, for protection against the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding circle of warriors. One more of their opponents</seg><seg type="columnLine">was disabled now, but the unequal battle was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Corians. Meriden was practically blind, and bleeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a dozen wounds; Lee was weak from loss of blood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering more physical pain than he had previously be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved possible for a man to endure, but he could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">yet see. Blood from his wounds had not blinded him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he saw Izanne in the doorway, motioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men to retreat toward the warplane. Lee took</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meriden's arm and drew him swiftly back. The move</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unexpected by the Corians, and for a second they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were alone in a group of seven.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that second Laura Ives exposed them to the steel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigue ray, and every one of their swords disintegrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">into impalpable dust. Meanwhile Meriden had again</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped the blood from his eyes. The seven men stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless a moment and leaped toward their planes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meriden leaped to forestall them. Lee shouted to Izanne</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn the ray-projector on the planes. She shook her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and snapped off the ray. Wondering, Lee rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Meriden's aid. Two of the Corians managed to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">off in one of the planes. The other five were held at</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay by Lee and Meriden. The Corians knew that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take little provocation indeed to cause Meriden</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run them through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl had snapped on the ray again, and had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the projector, mounted on top of the fuselage of the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, so that it caught the escaping Corian plane. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">disintegrated, and the two men in it were wearing no</seg><seg type="columnLine">parachutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, after a short conversation with the girl, Meri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den and Lee forced their prisoners, at sword-points, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">refill the tanks of the warplane with the fuel which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller planes had brought. In a few moments Lee had</seg><seg type="columnLine">disabled the Corian planes, and then the warplane rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Meriden at the controls. Lee stood by, intending to</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieve the giant when he tired, and Izanne watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men furtively, sensing the coolness between them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None of the three said anything. The giant and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthman needed medical attention badly. It soon be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came evident that Meriden intended to land on the broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge in front of the cave. He did it well, considering</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had lost several pints of blood, was suffering</seg><seg type="columnLine">from upwards of ten open wounds, and was blinded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood that persisted in flowing into his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The staff of the Inter planetarian treated their wounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and attended to the wound of Izanne. Her real identity</seg><seg type="columnLine">was revealed to the group from the earth. Benny Jacobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beside himself with grief. Here was startling news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">material, and his beloved news-unit was out of touch with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. Benny burst into genuine tears, and the tech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nical staff of the news unit redoubled their efforts at</seg><seg type="columnLine">improvising a usable cosmic radio from the material at</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, which wasn't much. It was evident that to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">open communication with the earth, new motors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators and instruments would be necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meriden took the first opportunity he could to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Izanne. "Is it true that . . . that they were successful</seg><seg type="columnLine">in destroying Sarvon with that ray?" he asked haltingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl did not reply, but he read the answer in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. It seemed to crush the giant. His city-nation de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed. It had existed for centuries, that proud city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one great structural unit with its foundations deep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle mire and its upper levels among the clouds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Destroyed. Meriden was not quite able tp comprehend</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely that idea. Izanne held out her hand to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he took it gratefully, tried to tell her a little of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grief, but choked on it, and turned away. The Swords-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of Sarvon was ashamed of tears. There was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else he wanted to tell her, too, but somehow he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not speak freely to this earthgirl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left her and sat by himself in the cave opening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">642</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brooding, wondering if he were the last of the Sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vonians alive. Thousands of them must have been killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the structure collapsed, ran his thoughts, but cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly thousands must have survived. But, with no tools</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steel, with nothing to protect them from the beasts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle, they could not exist long. He decided to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Sarvon in the plane. At least, he had some swords</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, good swords, wrought of tempered steel and bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished gold. Perhaps he could help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until he ceased to brood and started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that he thought of the perfectly good projector</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the steel-fatigue ray, mounted in that little fenced-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in enclosure on top of the fuselage of the Corian plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ir a few seconds it could be lowered into the fuselage</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, and projected downward through an opening in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor. It was a two-edged weapon. Cor was built</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steel, too. There was plenty of fuel in the plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both for the motors and for the generators that sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied the power for the ray. He had a means of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venge, but two men would be necessary, one to pilot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane and one to operate the projector. Meriden went</seg><seg type="columnLine">in search of Lee Chilton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon learning of her identity, .Burton Boyd had ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained from Laura Ives the key to the intricate code her</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother had used. She carefully detailed to him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematical processes by which the complex cipher</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be made to yield its secret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burton Boyd was more than anxious to send this</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge to the earth. There was no longer any dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger of war on the earth, and the secret of the liberation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and control of intra-atomic energy would be of tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous value to the earth. But it did not seem possible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplish communication across the void. Burton</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boyd was irritated by his inability to get into communica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with Robert Huston and Brad-Henson Ecclestone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he did not realize how vital to the world that com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munication would shortly become.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After his wounds had been dressed, Lee Chilton</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought out Izanne, finding her just after she was through</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking with Boyd, who had wandered back toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior of the cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very gently, because of her injured arm, Lee Chilton</seg><seg type="columnLine">took her in his arms and kissed her upturned lips. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was startled a little at the fervor with which she returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kiss. Her slender body was suddenly very limp</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his, and she started to cry softly, burying her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face in his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so it was that Meriden found them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meriden was very calm now. His face betrayed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion. In a low voice he asked Lee to go with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the plane, to avenge Sarvon, to destroy the city and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the immense rockets with which the Corians intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">invade the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lee went with Meriden in the warplane of Cor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left behind him a §tarry-eyed girl. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither of the two men spoke as the plane hurtled to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward Cor. It was very hot in the plane, in spite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed they were making and the wind which it produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the well-ventilated skyship. Meriden handled the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols, always climbing. Lee adjusted the projector to</seg><seg type="columnLine">point downward and waited, thinking of Izanne. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sure she loved him, though she had not said so, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he himself confessed his love, in words. Words</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't necessary. They understood each other. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meriden . . . How would the giant take it ? Lee knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Swordsman loved the girl sincerely, and that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Meriden considered Lee to have a right to her love only</seg><seg type="columnLine">if a duel proved Lee to be the better man. He was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a coward, Lee Chilton, but he hated the thought of fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the giant swordsman with whom he had shared so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many adventures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sudden appearance of half a dozen Corian planes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">(sent to investigate the mysterious silence of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">four) snapped Lee out of his meditations. He had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered what were evidently sights for the accurate</seg><seg type="columnLine">aiming of the ray, and he had disintegrated the six planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost before they were aware of the large plane above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The skyship roared on toward Cor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A series of tremendous explosions, at intervals of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds, rocked the plane. Far ahead, Lee saw through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the observation windows of the fuselage a tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">object shaped like a dirigible without motors or cabins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was rising vertically at tremendous and accelerating</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. Brilliant flame emerged from its lower end. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the few seconds it took for the object to disappear com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely in the clouds, Lee realized that it was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rockets leaving for the earth, but he did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that aboard it was Eenedar, meteorologist of Cor, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel equipped for destroying the vital ozone of the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He and Meriden were some five minutes too late; if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could have prevented the going of that rocket they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have rendered an incalculable service to the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but by the time they reached Cor, the rocket was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the atmosphere of Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So unexpected was their attack on Cor, that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely successful. The ray flashed down invisibly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the sights Lee saw the immense city crumple</seg><seg type="columnLine">into dust as it was exposed to the ray developed by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">own scientists. It was slaughter, the earthmen realized,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but only in that way could the power of the earth's great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est enemy be broken. They had shown no mercy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sarvon; they had calmly laid plans to decimate the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they did not need, because they coveted its wealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and power; they were reaping precisely what they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sown. It was like magic to see the structure crumple and</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapse and dissolve into powder, and it was horrible, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the City of Cor would never again threaten the earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no chance to organize resistance. The ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought down the few planes that managed to take off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The survivors, thought Lee grimly, could take up again</seg><seg type="columnLine">the age-old fight with the jungle. If the race survived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps the hardship would make it eleaner and better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seems to be true that a great nation falls when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeks wealth and power and luxury, which it does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">need.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cor was destroyed, yet that one rocket that escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">was speeding toward an unwarned, defenseless earth. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIX</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Battle of the Sky-Hordes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YET Cor was not dead yet. Near the city was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous cleared space in the jungle. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">incomplete rockets of the Corians were being built</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and the third had just left its berth between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps half of the Corians had gone to this enclosure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the rocket leave. Myriads of little planes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">parked near the rockets. Besides the citizens who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to watch the rocket's departure, there were also</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SWORDSMAN OF SARVON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">643</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of workers in the great and busy enclosure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lee had not attacked the rockets with his ray. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered the group of marooned earthmen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave who could not endure the sunlight of Venus because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its actinic rays, and he decided that the rockets should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be destroyed. At least one of them must be saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">for di Bargi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so, while the warplane passed and repassed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crumbling city of Cor, a swarm of little planes took</seg><seg type="columnLine">off from the enclosure. Most of them were armed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though few possessed the recently developed steel-fatigue</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray. They were armed with the Corian heat-ray and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical ray that paralyzed the engines of planes it</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched. Venerian planes had always fought with rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of projectiles had never been developed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hot Planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so the big warskyship was surrounded by in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerable little planes, every one of them bent on re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venge. For a moment it seemed that the big plane could</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut its way out of the swarm. Plane after plane sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly fell to pieces in the air as Lee manipulated the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">projector, but there were too many of them. Heat rays-</seg><seg type="columnLine">were striking the armored walls and making the interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature intolerable. N</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the motors missed and stopped dead. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corian rays had short-circuited every electrical connec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on the big plane, including the generator that pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided the power for the steel-fatigue ray projector. Lee</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw the battery switch desperately. Perhaps the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jector could be operated for a while on the batteries. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">results. It was evident that the Corian ray was short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circuiting the storage batteries too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plane was falling erratically. Meriden was trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to volplane down, but the skyship was too heavy, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing, that had been disabled by Meriden's bullets the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious night, rendered a smooth descent impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the motors caught on again. The unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corian had not been skilful enough to follow the erratic</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall of the plane with his short-circuiting ray. It was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most a perfect conductor of electricity, that ray, and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical device exposed to it could operate. But once</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of its field of influence, the plane was not perma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nently damaged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly Lee reversed the switch and disintegrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest little plane. Then the conducting ray stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engines again, and the warplane dropped. The tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perature was intolerable. Lee looked at one of the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows in the fuselage and saw that the glass was fusing</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the influence of one or more of the heat rays. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped aside, just as a beam of unendurable heat struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the projector which was pointing downward through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening in the fuselage floor. In a vain attempt to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">the projector from the effects of the heat ray, Lee threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the switch that lifted the projector up through the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fuselage to that fenced-in enclosure from whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">the projector could be pointed upward. In his frenzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">he forgot that the power was off again. The hoists did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not work, and the projector itself was fusing from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meriden, in the pilot's compartment, strove to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane under control. Both he and Lee realized that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not doing so, but the earthman was powerless to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help. In a terrestrial plane, Lee Chilton could have main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained control, but he had never learned anything of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls of a Venerian airplane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plane landed, smashing its undercarriage, in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">space between the two nearly-completed rockets. Meri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den and Lee leaped out, each with a sword in each hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hundreds of Corians ran toward the plane, all armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with heavy swords of good steel. The enclosure where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rockets were being built had not been exposed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray that had destroyed the city of Cor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more Lee Chilton found himself at the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Swordsman of Sarvon, fighting for life itself against</seg><seg type="columnLine">odds. It looked rather hopeless to Lee. Their wounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a few hours ago were still painful, in spite of the care</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been given by the surgeon from di Bargi's crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of earthmen. Never before had the odds against them</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so great. Well, all had to die sometime. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Chilton suddenly, a second before the near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est of his enemies reached him, "No! I'm going to live.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She'd be sorry if I died."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one second Meriden looked at him with steel-gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Then they gave their attention to the fighters that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were crowding around. Both their backs were against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fuselage of the wrecked plane and they were side by</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Lee fought with desperation, but the giant swords-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was very cool. An enigmatic smile flickered on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sarvonian's lips. With the efficiency of a scientific ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, he dispatched the first unfortunate individual who</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposed him, seized the man's swords, and hurled them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">three Corians who were near. The range was short, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant's aim was perfect. Each of the three Corians</seg><seg type="columnLine">died a clean painless death, before realizing that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been struck. This seemed to give the Corians an idea;</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a shouted signal, they all drew back and devoted their</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to throwing swords. With such overpowering</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers, perhaps it would be better to fight the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated Sarvonians at long range. They had plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">swords; the two by the plane had only six to begin with,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would have to pick up any others that they used.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are two ways of dealing with an accurately</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown sword. It can be dodged, or it can be fended off</seg><seg type="columnLine">by clever, very clever, manipulation of the defender's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword or swords. Meriden stood planted, turning aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swords of his enemies with those j aguar-hilted swords</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own. Lee dodged; he had had no practice in turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing aside swords, and he wished devoutly for armor, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavier the better, to say nothing of a shield. A peculiar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anachronistic civilization indeed; it had aircraft, heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays, and many other modern achievements, but the scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists of Venus had apparently never thought of inventing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shield. Lee side-stepped another sword, which clanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the plane's armor plate. Planes were armored</seg><seg type="columnLine">against heat-rays, yet no Venerian warrior ever wore any</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor. There was some reason in that, at least, ran the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthman's thoughts. The damned planet was hot enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a man in a tunic, let alone trying to run around in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit of tin. Lee dodged another sword. The Corians</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be stalling now, playing for time. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">more swords came close, yet Lee escaped unscathed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would have to get busier, he thought, if they in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to kill him within a month or so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before they could run for their lives, a flaming plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed into the group of Corians. Its fuel tank ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded. Lee had one second's glimpse of Meriden falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a flaming piece of the wreckage, jyid then some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing knocked him cleanly into the blackness of uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The swarm of planes that had brought down the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skyship had not been able to follow up their advantage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before they could land, a second swarm approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">644</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly through the clouds, and the startled Corians</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized them as Sarvonian planes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two swarms met and fought. It was not one large</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle, but rather tended to break up into thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">duels. And the Corians soon realized that the Sarvonian</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes were faster and more flexibly maneuverable, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had weapons which were new to Venus. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady tot-tot-tot-tot-tot of the Sarvonian machine guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">spelled out the final doom of Cor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For every plane brought down by the heat ray or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">short-circuiting ray of Cor, a dozen fell to the bullets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sarvon . . . steel-jacketed, incendiary, explosive bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets. Every few minutes one of them would penetrate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corian fuel-tank. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lee Chilton was not unconscious more than three min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes. He regained his senses to see Meriden leaning over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with that same unfathomable smile. And close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meriden's side was another, whom Lee recognized as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xavian, supreme ruler of Sarvon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Rare Earth Metals</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT had been short and decisive, that battle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corian planes had fallen by scores, and those that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were left soon showed the green signal of surrender.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of the Sarvonian planes had caught sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two standing by the wrecked skyship and had recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant Meriden. At radio orders from Xavian, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was personally commanding the expedition, the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sarvonian pilots had looped low to let their gunners strafe</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Corians by the two immense rockets. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">aided by the accident of the flaming Corian plane's fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the group threatening the two comrades. Landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately, the Sarvonians in Xavian's plane had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown aside the fragments of flaming wood and twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel that had almost buried Meriden, who was stunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and burned, but not seriously hurt; and in a minute more</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had brought Lee Chilton back to consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Meriden addressed his ruler. "I am glad you</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped the destruction of the city."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Xavian looked dumbfounded. "The only city that has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been destroyed is the city of Cor, and you destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that," he stated. "I do not understand you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sarvon was not destroyed?" The giant's voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredulous and trembling. Xavian hastened' to reas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly not. But we had given you up as lost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When you did not return, we decided to strike at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These new weapons were made by Grantolon and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">staff under the direction of the three brothers Dornn, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth, whom you saved from death at Corian hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are with us now, in one of the planes. Their wea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pons have saved your life in turn. You are well repaid."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I do not understand," said the bewildered giant. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he proceeded to inform Xavian of the Corian plane that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed over Sarvon in the darkness with the steel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigue ray. He told of the effectiveness of that ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all the other instances they had seen it operated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed Xavian himself could see by the most casual</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at what had once been the proud city-nation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cor that there was no doubting the destructive effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that ray upon steel. Nor could Lee Chilton offer any</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation of the ray's failure to destroy Sarvon. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussed it as Xavian's plane flew homeward, sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by the air-fleet of Sarvon, deciding that either</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Corians had made a mistake as to the location of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sarvon, or else had been amiss in some way about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projection of the ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither of these suppositions was true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the suggestion of Meriden and Lee Chilton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xavian ordered his pilot and about a dozen others to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him at the cave containing the party from earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The broad ledge of the cliff gave ample room for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skilful landing of planes. The rest of the fleet returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Sarvon, except those who had been stationed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure near Cor to supervise the prisoners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was again late in the day when Xavian's plane ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the immense mountain barrier that rose out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jungle between Sarvon and Cor. Through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane's telescope Lee saw the cave opening on the ledge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the earth party were out of sight in the interior, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun was still in the clouded sky, but Laura Ives had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to fear in her Venerian body, and she was out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side watching the heavens anxiously. Lee saw her jump</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and wave at the plane. He leaned out of the circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">window of the cabin and waved back. As the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed, he noticed again the cool smile of Meriden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Xavian was surprised to see Izanne, but said little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meriden, Xavian, Izanne and Lee entered the cave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meriden introduced his ruler, and Lee Chilton presented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon learning of the disaster to the earth-rocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xavian promised to have the Sarvonian scientists and</seg><seg type="columnLine">builders complete the Corian rockets, one of which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented to the earth. Professor di Bargi accepted</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyously. Then the old Sarvonian, expressing the hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">that soon interplanetary commerce and friendship, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as had existed in the pre-Hellene days of Atlantis, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon be reestablished to the benefit of both worlds, asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth-party to be his guests in Sarvon. At di Bargi's</seg><seg type="columnLine">request, the chemist of the party explained that the earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men could not endure the Venerian sunlight, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to wait in the cave the few hours before night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall, and to embark then for Sarvon, which would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached before morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conversation had been in English, which Xavian</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke fluently. Suddenly the girl gave a startled ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamation in the Sarvonian tongue. "Sarvon was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed after all," she said. And then, to Meriden, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of explanation, "I was almost sure that it hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, but I didn't dare tell you until I knew. I was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Xavian and Meriden and Lee Chilton listened intently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her explanation. Later she gave it in English for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit of the terrestrials.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My brother, Harrison Ives, was the world's greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority on the rare earth metals, such as dysprosium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yttrium, lutecium, samarium, and so on; he spent years</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigating their physical and chemical properties; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the things he discovered was this: Certain of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare metals, if alloyed with steel in sufficient quantities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it immune to what is called steel-fatigue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For centuries steel-fatigue had been known. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">first investigated seriously back in the first part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twentieth century. It occurs at rare intervals.

The alloy was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all practicable commercially. Sixty pounds or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of rare-earth metals to each ton of steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far too costly; most of the metals of that group</seg><seg type="columnLine">are more difficult to obtain and cost far more than gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">or platinum.

Each time it shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the world, at an altitude of approximately one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and twenty-five miles, it would pass over a dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent section of the rotating earth. Its speed would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be slightly better than ten miles a second, they figured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they would be high enough above the atmosphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so they would not be slowed down by friction, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">close enough so that their ray would destroy the ozone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the earth's upper atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an intricate calculation, taking into considera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the masses and orbits and velocities of the earth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocket, the resistance of the atmosphere when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket first plunged through it, and dozens of minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">factors, but at last Eenedar was satisfied. The great</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of the rocket would make it practically impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for earth artillery to score a direct hit with a projectile</seg><seg type="columnLine">large enough to harm the rocket, and Eenedar knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred and twenty-five miles was an extreme range,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even for the most powerful guns of the earth, though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was practicable for the projector of his dissociating ray.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the most beautiful features of his plan was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of visible evidence of the splitting up of the ozone</seg><seg type="columnLine">molecules. The ray was invisible, the dissociated oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms reassociated into ordinary oxygen molecules with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no violent show of energy or any other visible evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the occurrence. The inhabitants of the earth could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see what was going on; but as soon as the already</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely small percentage of ozone in the air became</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller, no terrestrial could endure the light of the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those who were not killed by exposure to the sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to remain in shelter, and could not prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing of the rocket. Once on earth, the steel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigue ray, employing almost the same principles as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, would make easy the conquest of those who es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caped the sunlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Eenedar did not intend to let any of them escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunlight.

It started its rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling of the earth, and its invisible ray was thinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the ozone of the earth's atmosphere, removing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">protective filter of the extreme ultra-violet rays, destroy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the balance of conditions under which life had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is a tremendous difference between a molecule</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed of three oxygen atoms and a molecule of only</seg><seg type="columnLine">two oxygen atoms!

In spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fact that he had never seen a pistol a month before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant was trying to inflict a clean, painless death by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shot through the brain, rather than take the easier aim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a body shot, that, unless it were actually through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, would bring death only after suffering. The head</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a small target at seventy feet, compared to the body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lee did not return the shot. There was no hurry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The giant was aiming again, more carefully. Instinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively Lee sensed the second that Meriden was to pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trigger, and stepped aside. The bullet missed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">by three feet, this time. Meriden had one shot left. Lee</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that same half-smile on the giant's lips. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot left. Very slowly, without the least emotion or</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervousness, Meriden was lifting his pistol again. Lee</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not lifted his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the vision of Laura Ives rose in Lee's mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the first time in his life Lee Chilton understood what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">real fear was. He struggled to prevent his fear from</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifesting itself to the giant and the watchers. Meri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den had one shot left, and the giant was so devilishly</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool about it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind the transparent panel, Burton Boyd gasped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chilton was calmly taking three chances with death. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he won, the giant would be at his mercy. If he lost. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meriden fired again, and missed, by a very small frac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of a zot. Lee Chilton dropped his loaded pistol and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked toward the giant. The watchers did not move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meriden's expression did not change. Lee came close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have my code of honor, too," said Lee Chilton of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earth. "I cannot shoot you. If you would like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue with swords. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The others were entering. Meriden's half-smile grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper. "You are worthy of her, Lee Chilton. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">before have I seen a man take three such chances with</seg><seg type="columnLine">death for the sake of friendship, however great. I wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">you happiness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giant held out his hand. Lee took it without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burton Boyd had picked up the gun that Lee had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped, had brought it with him as he approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. The giant spoke again, to Lee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you once, Earthman, that I was sincere in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">love for her. The realization that she could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy with me came slowly. It hurt me. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">her happiness I wished, above all.

For the sake of friendship, do not fail me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The same inscrutable smile played around the giant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. He took Lee's unused pistol from the hand of Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton Boyd. At the opposite end of the room, seventy feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, were three tiny marks in the steel wall, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meriden's three bullets had hit.

Yet the event, unheralded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unprecedented though it was, was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most important occurrences in human his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. His coming was a distinct shock to the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, despite the marvelous advances of science from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its birth in 1896 to that date. The inconceivable distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be traversed, the enormous energy required to trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port a heavy machine from planet to planet, and the all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful force of gravity, seemed insurmountable</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects to even the most broadminded and optimistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinkers. Feeble attempts were made even in 1931 to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave this speck of the universe and soar to other worlds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but constant failures dulled the ardor of those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to connect our world with the others which</seg><seg type="columnLine">acknowledge the same central sun. Hope flourished</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the almost successful (perhaps indeed successful)</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt of four German scientists to soar from the hide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound earth, who departed in their famous rocket in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1938, bound for the moon. The world is certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they never returned, unless they landed in some very</seg><seg type="columnLine">remote spot, unseen by human eyes; and it cannot be</seg><seg type="columnLine">said where they are, whether lost in boundless space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive or dead on the moon, or perhaps scattered in min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute particles in the infinite. Again, five years later, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globular ship of two intrepid Americans vanished from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth, never to be seen or heard from; and during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the period just following the Martian signaling, several</seg><seg type="columnLine">others were lost and many more crashed. Although the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatalities far exceeded these probable successes, the hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of interplanetary travel was still uppermost in our minds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We know now, that our failure can be attributed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfortunate lack of radioactive elements, and not to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of ingenuity or inventiveness. It was only too true,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as Professor Billings stated in 1945, that the only type</seg><seg type="columnLine">of engine which could possibly transport a heavy ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine from our earth to some planet, would have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atomic-energy engine, which, with a minimum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel and the very necessary radioactive element, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">develop an unlimited amount of energy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He even drew plans of the basic principles of such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine, estimated the amount of radioactive material</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed, and worked out the propulsion of the ship. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory, which he advanced to the scientific world, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direct cause of Professor Riehm's remarkable de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopment of transmutation of elements, for it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">found, upon investigation, that at least twenty-five times</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amount of actinium existing in the world would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed to send a ship to the moon. Professor Riehm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizing that the probability of discovering a rich ore</seg><seg type="columnLine">of actinium was too remote to be relied on, decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that transmutation alone was the keynote to this baffling</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His first great wrork was to break down the ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">platinum of commerce to iso-platinum 192! In other</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, he made a variety of platinum with a specific</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity of 21.021! It consequently had a lower melting</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, a lower specific heat, and higher atomic volume!</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a full understanding of this, one must review the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past of science, a wonderful stairway of facts and truths,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading to Truth enthroned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Prout, back in the days of the dawn of science, for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mulated the theory that elements were aggregates of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen atom, and hence every atomic weight should</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out exactly and without fractions, or very nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">even. His contemporaries, all able men, examined care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully the then existing list of elements, and although a</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprising number came out very close to whole numbers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good many were halfway between.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stas, a German, then proceeded to redetermine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic weights and came to the conclusion that Prout</seg><seg type="columnLine">mm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">m</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Our universal-power flashlights lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the interior of the globe suffused</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a greenish glow from the reflec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of things made of a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST MARTIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">653</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was wrong, for no matter how carefully done, chlorine</seg><seg type="columnLine">always came out 35.5, and several others, too, showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an uneven atomic weight, with full allowance for experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental error. This marked the doom of Prout's hypo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thesis, and he died in the belief that he had failed to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veal to the world a great truth, because of the bigoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">beliefs, and inaccurate work of Stas. As it chanced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both were right. Stas had done his work admirably well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet Prout's Theory was not a mere dream. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">early in this century, a series of brilliant spectroscopic</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments proved that many, in fact most, of the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, were mixtures of bodies, chemically alike, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">EACH HAVING A WHOLE NUMBER ATOMIC</seg><seg type="columnLine">WEIGHT!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For instance, Aston, the investigator, found that tin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was composed of no less than eight isotopes, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic weights are as follow: 116, 117, 118, 119, 120,</seg><seg type="columnLine">121, 122, 124. Each of these iso-elements is chemically</seg><seg type="columnLine">identical with all the others; but possessed each of vary-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing specific gravities. It will be noticed that two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">isotopes are actually greater in atomic weight than anti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony (121.77), the element following tin. No doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two of the isotopes of antimony (they have not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet been investigated thoroughly) are identical in atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight with one or two of tin!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The average of all the isotopic weights of any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">element, with due regard to their relative proportions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives the present value for the atomic weight. For as</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet (beyond a very limited number) we have not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to separate the isotopes of many elements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We shall now, after this short digression, be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">better to understand Professor Riehm's remarkable ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment whereby he made iso-platinum 192. Let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">read from his account of the transmutation:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-it was found that platinum was composed of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">following isotopes: 192, 194, 195, and 198. Isotope 192</seg><seg type="columnLine">has a 48He (helium) proton; 194, a 48He--2H (hydro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gen) proton; 195, a 48He--3H proton; and 198, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">49He--2H proton. The problem now resolved itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this: to remove by a sufficiently powerful agency the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excess hydrogen protons of isos 194, 195, and 198, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing isos 192 and 196.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ordinary chemical reactions have no effect on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proton, of course, so some more powerful agency was</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed. We tried radium with no effect, nor even radon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">radium emanation, which is hard to isolate, and hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle, but extremely more radioactive. Finally we</seg><seg type="columnLine">used actinium, no. 89, with success.-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our apparatus was merely a thick-walled cylinder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead, Yt. meter long, whose ends tapered to points, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings at each point--a large one at one end, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small one at the other. In the large end was placed, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a built-in receptacle, the specimen of platinum to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">altered. In the other end we suspended a milligram</seg><seg type="columnLine">of actinium, quite a powerful agency. In making the</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparations, my assistants and myself wore lead-lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">suits, and helmets with goggles of lead glass. Actinium</seg><seg type="columnLine">is much more powerful than radium, and a milligram is</seg><seg type="columnLine">decidedly deadly to a man if he works with it for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of time while unprotected from its penetrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">gamma rays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Using a cube of platinum at first, we had no success.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We bathed it in different ether rays while the gamma</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays from the actinium acted upon it. No results--</seg><seg type="columnLine">powdered platinum was the solution, known as platinum</seg><seg type="columnLine">black. After the hour was up, we removed the platinum</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">black, no physical change being apparent; but, to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">great joy, upon weighing it, a loss of weight showed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had increased the proportion of isotope 192 by about</seg><seg type="columnLine">25%. Subsequent trials with refined apparatus and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more exact methods of procedure yielded specimens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost pure iso-platinum 192 and 196, which are easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated by the difference of their melting points.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The announcement to the scientific world of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding feat aroused long controversy and numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">conjectures. The International Science Group of Paris</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked for a specimen of Professor' Riehm's iso-platinum</seg><seg type="columnLine">192 and upon examining it carefully, announced to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world that the great German had indeed produced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">isotope of platinum of atomic weight 192 exactly! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the spring of 1971. Already, at this time, several</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists suggested that the Law of Definite Proportions</seg><seg type="columnLine">be declared null and void, but the actual act did not go</seg><seg type="columnLine">into force till 1975, when Delande made five different</seg><seg type="columnLine">chlorides of tin of the same formula!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Transmutation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE will skip the intervening years from 1971 to</seg><seg type="columnLine">1974, during which time several isotopes of differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent elements were isolated in small quantities by various</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigators, and return to Professor Riehm in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boston laboratory. A big American firm had induced</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to work solely for them for an enormous compensa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He moved from Berlin to Boston and continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">his experiments in one of the best-equipped laboratories</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever built. Here it was that he and his^assistants broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a series of elements and iso-elements, including</seg><seg type="columnLine">zinc, which was broken down into the non-metal sulphur!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The process was kept a secret and all we know even to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day is that some powerful radioactive body other than</seg><seg type="columnLine">actinium was used with, however, practically the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus as that for the making of iso-Pt 192.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The decomposing (or, more modernly, the isoprotiz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing) of zinc into sulphur was of more interest to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific world than to the industrial world for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he labored, but the big men behind knew that sooner or</seg><seg type="columnLine">later would come their chance. Sometime Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riehm would discover a process that would enrich them</seg><seg type="columnLine">immensely. That was why they lured him away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berlin, where he had been working in the interests of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure science, and business men seldom make a mistake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It came in a mild way, when out of barium, Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riehm made silver! The raw products were barium</seg><seg type="columnLine">chloride, a very cheap salt, and certain radio-elements,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the final product was silver in the form of ingots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hydrogen chloride gas as a valuable by-product. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">big firm immediately began turning out electrical instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments with silver replacing the copper for a conducting</seg><seg type="columnLine">medium, and inside of five years, copper as an electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">conductor was unheard of, silver being far superior to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in more ways than one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had this been done back in the early part of the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tury, when some countries were on a silver standard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all countries used it for currency, there would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a world panic. But in 1974, when money was all paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">based on real estate, no ill effects resulted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Riehm spent the rest of his active days</seg><seg type="columnLine">in perfecting various processes for the giant concern</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> *	Actinium itself produces no radiation of any kind, but it suffer* con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinual inter-protonic rearrangement, constantly forming actinium A (Iso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tope of polonium) which immediately breaks down into actinium B</seg><seg type="columnLine">(isotope of lead) which gives off very powerful gamma raye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">654</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which owned him.

Suffice it to say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">three atoms of iso-iron 56 plus one atom of iso-alumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">num 27 in protonic union gives one atom of iso-platinum</seg><seg type="columnLine">195. There are exactly enough hydrogen and helium</seg><seg type="columnLine">protons and free electrons to make normal platinum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic weight 195 but thirteen free electrons had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">transferred from the outer shells or orbits to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nucleus! This was the task which Dr. Svens had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon himself. Working upon this principle that three</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts by atomic-measure of iso-iron 56 (purified by Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Riehm's process) plus one part of iso-aluminum</seg><seg type="columnLine">27 would give one part of iso-platinum 195, he subjected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the correct proportions of the lower metals to various</seg><seg type="columnLine">radioactive radiations, with no success whatsoever. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">metals were finely ground and carefully mixed; every</seg><seg type="columnLine">radioactive material procurable was tried, and still con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant failure resulted. It was not until a small amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of iso-Pt 195 was mixed with the raw products that</seg><seg type="columnLine">success came. The yield was, however, poor; after dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solving out of the fused mass the unchanged iron and</seg><seg type="columnLine">aluminum by boiling hydrochloric acid, a small amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of iso-Pt 195 was found, running to .01% of the total</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Small as the yield was, the materials were cheap and</seg><seg type="columnLine">several great chemical concerns took over Dr. Svens'</seg><seg type="columnLine">process and put synthetic platinum on the market at one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">third the price of natural platinum. This was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">boon to the chemists, who found it thus easier to procure</seg><seg type="columnLine">the much-needed platinum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Svens, in his laboratory up in northern Sweden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">next attempted the production of artificial actinium! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard about Professor Billings and his famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic-engine theory and his estimation of the amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of actinium needed to run it. Imbued with the grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose of conquering space and establishing communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation wifh Mars, which he knew was inhabited by</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason of the Period of Signaling a decade before, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps other planets, he began that series of famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments which culminated in the production of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Svenium, the Wonder-Metal of today, a radioactive body</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least 1000 times more powerful than any natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">material. He reached the grand goal which Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riehm had set before himself, but never attained</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, as it chanced, before Dr. Svens perfected his</seg><seg type="columnLine">process, the First Martian landed on earth, up in north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern Michigan, near the shores of Lake Superior. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing occurred three months after the making of iso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pt 195 in 1978, and just about the time that Svens began</seg><seg type="columnLine">his work on synthetic actinium. Undismayed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing of his hopes of first conquering space, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">labored on and in 1981 he announced success--success</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond his dreams. He not only made actinium but also</seg><seg type="columnLine">element 87, an alkali metal, and so radioactive that its</seg><seg type="columnLine">period (i.e. half its life) is three minutes! He was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to isolate it, but found that when alloyed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">actinium, it became much longer lived and still capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of producing enormous energy-products. He made by</seg><seg type="columnLine">dint of much labor a large supply of the alloy, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsequently became known as Svenium, or more popu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly, the Wonder Metal, and offered it to the Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">Klan, of which he was a member.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a short time the ship built by the Mars Klan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">propelled by the Wonder Metal rose into the air, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving behind the shouts and mad acclaim of admiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands, sped to Mars, equipped with powerful engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and staunchly built to withstand space conditions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was somewhat surprising that after the landing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pioneer, or the First Martian, no Martian ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately followed. The next one to arrive here came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week after Dr. Svens' ship had left Earth. In fact, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it later proved, the Martian ship had left Mars on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same day our ship, the Tellurian, had left Earth; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tellurian made the journey in less time than did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian ship! Hence the first official spaceship</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Earth arrived on Mars before her first official (the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pioneer was a lone flyer, whose departure from Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">was witnessed by only one person) ship reached earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then, the handicaps we had to overcome! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians had abundant supplies of radioactive bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and needed but to invent the atomic-energy engine, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to make our actinium after long years of intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">research, the fruit of perhaps 85 years of scientific ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The principle of the atomic engine was discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth before the fuel to run it was found. On Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fuel was there for the taking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian Superiority</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IF this account reaches the eyes of Martians and may</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to them rather boastful and impertinent, I give</seg><seg type="columnLine">them this reason: I have written spaceship, this in answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Markin Lavlo's book, "Martian Superiority." It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely a gentle reminder that beyond the remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight of the First Martian, we Tellurians can claim to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the pioneers of space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It must not be thought that we of earth in any way</seg><seg type="columnLine">minimize the great and historical space flight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pioneer. Far from it. We are as quick in our homage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his dead body and everlasting spirit in the museum</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the spot of landing as his fellow-Martians themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The foregoing has prepared the reader for the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the arrival of Kastory Impan, the First Martian, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pioneer, whose name is held today in reverence by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peoples of two great worlds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are numerous other accounts of the arrival, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">none have gone back into the past to show the connec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion between scientific research in transmutation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">interplanetary flight; a point. I think, directly connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST MARTIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">655</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to the first space flight and subsequent establishment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">commercial relationship. It is true, that without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight of Dr. Sven's ship, the Earth would still be as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead; the Martians would still have come, but that does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not detract from the honor and glory forever associated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the names of Professor Wilhelm Riehm, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">founder of the science of transmutation, and Dr. Jarl</seg><seg type="columnLine">Svens, who developed it. I challenge Martia, the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">race of Mars, to bring up a scientist to compare with</seg><seg type="columnLine">either of these two:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I may add that quite by accident I came across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little sub-plot which goes with story of the arrival of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the First Martian. I'm certain no one ever heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregory Stewart before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Arrival</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UPON the gently-sloping greensward in the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the forested First Bluff, one of the myriads of</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaks of the Porcupine Mountain Range, just a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles outside of the small town of Bessemer in the year</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 1978, a group of holiday picnickers were startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their merrymakings to see descending near them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sickening speed, a dull, green-hued sphere. Appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing high in the air as a balloon, it rapidly increased in</seg><seg type="columnLine">size, and when about a hundred feet above the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, wabbled uncertainly, and then crashed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground with a metallic, crackling sound. After swaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth slightly, it finally came to a dead rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So startling was this incident that it deprived the merry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">makers of all action. In attitudes of astonishment, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed speechless at the strange object, hardly knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to expect next. With excited exclamations, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impetuous youths of the group ran towards it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll bet it's another of those crazy planetary ships,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled one excitedly. "They try 'em by the dozens now-</seg><seg type="columnLine">adays."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Or else it's a new perpetual-motion air glider."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Or maybe it's a new raiding plane from the Chinese,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">chimed in a third, breathless from running.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, whatever it is," came from a fourth, "the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor, or whoever runs it, is sure gone!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon the heels of the racing youths, each eager to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, followed the elders and the children, all thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their tasty lunch, lying on the sward, forgotten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surrounding the globe upon their approach, they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know what to make of it, for it was such a strange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking object. One of the boys, in his curiosity, ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced close and touched its metallic side, but quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrew his hand with a cry of pain and sucked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorched fingers. Being in diameter about ten feet, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like nothing more than a huge glass ball, tinted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a light green; of smooth, unseamed surface. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening of any kind could be discerned in the area of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere's surface, except that the bottom side, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it had landed, seemed to have been crushed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jagged edge buried in the earth. No sound could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard from the interior of the globe, and the excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">picknickers chattered volubly, conjecturing and gesticula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting, trying to make something out of the puzzle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the older men voiced the opinion that it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have been cast as a whole; and that seemed an impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, look ?" he cried, "if it's some sort of an airship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how could the driver get into it? I've just walked all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around it and I can't see a door!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It must be on the underside," his companion, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger man, replied. "Just our luck, too, or we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have entered and seen what's what. If there's anybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">in there, and there surely must be, unless it's radio con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled, he'll die--if he isn't already dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, Louie," he called to a boy, "run to the high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and see if you can find a motorcopper." He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other man. "I guess that's all we can do till he</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes, Mr. Boldt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It occurs to me," said Mr. Boldt to the other, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">name was Ramson, "that that metal doesn't look like</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal!

Of course, it can't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, or it would be smashed to hits!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It landed with enough force to snap steel," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ramson, "but this stuff seems to be intact, except where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it struck the earth." He bent down and looked closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the smashed portion of the huge globe. "In fact, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only place it did smash is where it landed on a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, which you can just see there," he pointed. "Over</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other side, it merely depressed the ground."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A third man joined them. "There is a door to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing," he cried. "Come on; I'll show you." He led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way to the other side. "There, right above our</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads, you can see the crack which separates it from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. It's flush with the surface and looks like a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was, indeed, the door, about four feet long and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet wide, and indistinguishable, except for the fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracks separating it from the main wall of the globe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was evident that the sole means of opening it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the inside--inside, where perhaps someone lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt or dead. It was the usual thing for unsuccessful</seg><seg type="columnLine">rockets and spaceships to either smash to pieces on re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning, or to land so lightly that the occupant, or occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pants, escaped unscathed, and stepped smiling out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their temporarily-disabled ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment a man came hurrying up, easily recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized as a farmer by the spotless white suit and wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brimmed straw hat.

My friends here-" he proceeded to introduce</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Chaws was introduced as manager of Section D</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the well-known Brinkley Farm, whose products al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways sold well in big-city markets.

Section D bordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side of the woods near which the picnickers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had started to eat lunch, and specialized in dairying</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than grains.

All the men smiled, for at that time the motor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coppers had very indefinite schedules, as compared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the present strict system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of all the places to land, this is the worst," com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented Mr. Chaws.

Mr. Ramson continued and emphasized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that it would take a hydrotorch to open the mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous object and get in to rescue the pilot of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's the door?" asked Mr. Steelstrong.

When the Pioneer</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed in 1978, eleven years after the signaling so sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly stopped, many people said its coming was the mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage conveyed by the Martian Signals, but we know to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, the two events had no connection.

But it is doubtful if the Klan would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made good, if it hadn't gathered into its folds Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Svens, the one person responsible for the success of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Work was begun in earnest the following year. Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Svens promised to produce actinium within a decade; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineers worked together on the construction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tellurian, which, after making six flights to Mars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, was placed in the Moscow Museum, where it rests</seg><seg type="columnLine">today, viewed daily by thousands.

The astronomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">also had their part to do: to dig up and record some 350</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of painstaking data on Mars and all features of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars, and also to study with renewed intensity the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">through telescopes. All in all, much valuable experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental work was done before the actual accomplishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their aims, and a great deal of by-product results was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filed away for future use. And in the midst of all this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a prophesy, came the arrival of Kastory Impan, The</seg><seg type="columnLine">First Martian:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregory Stewart</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the motorcop spoke into his little short wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitter to report to headquarters of the land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of a strange, green-hued sphere, he did not know the</seg><seg type="columnLine">furore he caused in the mind of a certain man seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the dials of his short-wave set. It had been more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less of a puzzle to the motorcop and the crew who came</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his call, why, almost immediately after their arrival,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heads of the Ironwood Laboratory, branch 28 of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Federal Laboratory, also came up in a universal-power</seg><seg type="columnLine">car. The scientists spoke of a mysterious call from</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone who in a voice of anguish told them a Martian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the First Martian, had arrived on earth at First Bluff</seg><seg type="columnLine">near Bessemer, begging them to hurry, because he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably badly hurt. The writer of this article suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in piecing together the scattered facts after con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable trouble and revealing the little drama behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrival of the Pioneer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A middle-aged, quiet, and quite well-to-do eccentric</seg><seg type="columnLine">had bought a small brick house Just on the northern edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bessemer and therein had established a small experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental radio laboratory. Small, insignificant, and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtrusive, people had, after the usual run of gossip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost completely forgotten him. In fact, that made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubly hard to secure the necessary information about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his activities, as no one knew of them. He simply had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had listened steadily and eagerly to the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">Signals at the time of their occurrence and had, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose, built himself a long-wave set copied from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention of the famous amateur who made possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio reception from Mars. After the Martians had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly ceased broadcasting in 1967, this experimenter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregory Stewart, put the useless set aside and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to his old field, short-wave experimenting. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">1970 he left for Europe, apparently to satisfy a "wander-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lust." From then he traveled to different regions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe, erratically skipping from city to city and place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. His "wanderlust" satisfied, he returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory in Bessemer and began work on an incom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted report, vhich the writer has procured, on the ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fects of the Hu\ iside Layer on radio waves. It is pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, almost certain, that completion of this work would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made broadcasting to Mars an accomplished thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the adoption of Martian long-wave methods. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe to identify the reception of strange signals on Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">from time to time after 1972 with the efforts of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscure man, whose apparatus, however, was found</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely demolished. It is surmised the Martian sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naling had imbued him with the desire to retaliate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But night after night, as he glanced now and then at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old high wave set, an irresistible impulse grew with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in him, a hunch, more or less, that the Martians would</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time recommence signaling, perhaps in answer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his efforts to reach them. At last, almost driven to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traction by haunting thoughts of missing it when it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">(this is gleaned from his incomplete and erratic diary)</seg><seg type="columnLine">he devised a scheme whereby, should the Martians re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">establish broadcasting to earth on the old wave length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about 30,000 meters, he would be notified by the flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a small light in an open circuit. He had revised a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystal set and along with the high-wave design, had in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted a very sensitive heat-indicator, and connected it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the break in the light circuit. If, at any time, the signals</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Mars came again, the crystal, sensitized to it by</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST MARTIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">659</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the high-wave design, would send a minutely weak, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely unhearable impulse through a coil surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the heat indicator. This heat indicator was the heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the whole scheme. Several years back, an investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gator had perfected a thermo-electric globe, made of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret metal, which in response to the slightest amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of radio-heat (i. e. the border line waves between heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and radio) waves would close an electric circuit. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">coil surrounding it produced this necessary radio-heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse when the signals came and as a result, the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuit would be closed, lighting the small lamp, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">observer would be appraised of the signaling. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">then simply have to connect up his big set and tune in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several times the light had momentarily flashed, but at</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time had there been a permanent and lasting broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast; probably some accidental effect of earthly experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But one night it happened. In a trice the man, await-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing just this occurrence, had hooked up the big set,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although his hands trembled so, he dropped the ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phones twice. His astonishment may be imagined when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard, instead of signals, a voice! True, a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">and muffled voice, but nevertheless they were articula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of a rational being. It is possible that the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecstatically drank in the triumph of first hearing of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">living and of all dead peoples the voice of a Martian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In breathless suspense, we may imagine him, listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">spellbound to a language he could not in the least under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, momentarily disconnected with things material,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and experiencing a sublime emotion, that of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to do something!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His diary is especially illuminating at this point:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"voice that soothes and lulls, at least to me.

He hooked up the set of his invention and</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched on the current. No one knows what he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">but probably they were impassioned words of cheer and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome, and the effect on the Martian, again from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diary, is given here:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His voice became eager, his words more rapid; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">although we had no way of understanding each other, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">verily believe something in common in our thoughts gave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him hope and comfort and me-!

No one had accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an inconceivable thing as far as anyone knew, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians were assured, but they maintained, with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual persistency, that someone on our earth had spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him while he was yet in mid-space and from then till</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fatal landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Affairs came to a climax.

The first object to engage our at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention was the body of the First Martian to arrive on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this earth. Perhaps four feet long, with massive chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spindly legs, the Pioneer lay stretched out, on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin and wasted face a most frantic look of despair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear.

Among the articles in the ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavy, metal box, securely attached to the floor-wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which housed the atomic-energy engine; another, sknilar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearing box nearby was ajar and inside were jars of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar, practically unbreakable glass, some of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing crust-like substances and others water, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oily liquid and miscellaneous articles. Fastened securely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the walls all around were various instruments of deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate and fine make easily recognized as thermometer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock, telescope, sextant-like affair, an acceleration and</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed recorder, altimeter, and several seemingly purpose-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less instruments.

In six different places, equidistant from</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other, were shutter-like arrangements.

And, from their point of view, the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">deaths their course occasioned here on earth would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">well justified by the prevention of the disastrous conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quences if man ever did reach Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this lies in the past.

But as the scientific knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and power of man marches steadily onward, the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">must surely come when man, too, will take to space and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sail to other worlds. When he sails to Venus, will it be</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an invader or a friend ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Venerians, no doubt, believe that he will come</seg><seg type="columnLine">combatively, and probably from now on will be busily</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparing weapons with which to resist the hordes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth that will someday drop out of the sky. Many there</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be on earth, too, who will want to see man go as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">conqueror, who will vision an empire of humans extend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from end to end of the solar system, from Mercury</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Pluto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It may be that their visions will be fulfilled and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venerians will go down under a human invasion after</seg><seg type="columnLine">long resistance, and their little islands will be peopled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by human^colonists. It may be that less-developed races</seg><seg type="columnLine">on other planets will be exterminated also to the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">glory of humanity. Certainly there will be many in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">future day who would thrill to the trumpet-call challenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring every planet in our system under the domination</seg><seg type="columnLine">of man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there is a chance, also, that when man does visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus and the other worlds, it will not be as a conqueror</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as a friend. There is a chance that by that time man</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have outgrown his barbaric war-fever that still racks</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth and will have seen it for the childish thing it is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unworthy of a mature race.

Usually we had illustrated pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures and diagrams, but this morning the professor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">elected to draw his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And very little more is known about this subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">than was known some ten years ago," the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was saying. "It has baffled the efforts of all the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists, but someday it will be solved. Undoubtedly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the solution of this problem will come the emanci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pation of the world from much of its labor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I came home that night, I found Harvey tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendously excited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say," he began, "did you listen to the lecture this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was asleep," I confessed. "What was the old duck</seg><seg type="columnLine">raving about?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Raving?" repeated Harvey, staring at me incredu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lously--he took his professors very seriously--"Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was talking about the most interesting subject in</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemistry--that is to say, in the world. He lectured on</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic disintegration."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pure bunkum," I responded rather contemptuously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my interest evaporating at once. "That is one problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will never be solved." I left him before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">start arguing because I knew from past experience that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would lose any argument on theory with him. I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to agree, whether I believed him or not, in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get some peace. Harvey Wilkins had a peculiar bull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog tenacity that made him never give up an idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was once convinced was practicable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, things ran on in their usual course and we grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uated with our Bachelor's degree in chemistry. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just at this time that fate stepped in with a little inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that probably changed the history of the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The incident was only a carelessly handled rifle up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canadian woods, but it resulted in the death of Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vey's multimillionaire uncle. When the will was read,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was found that Harvey was the sole heir to his uncle's</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions. Harvey was thus enabled to go out west to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arizona--his lungs were weak--and to build himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wonderful research laboratory, with a corps of as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistants and all the apparatus that he wanted. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, he offered me a job but I had already agreed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go into the government service and he did not urge me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I worked up from a junior chemist in the government</seg><seg type="columnLine">service until I became a senior chemist. Then I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">transferred over to work on some cases for the diplo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">662</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREAT INVASION OF 1955</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">663</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">matic service and I became a permanent fixture there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My chemical training enabled me to take a scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of many things, and to give advice that proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpful to those who controlled the destinies of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In all this time, I had not lost track of Harvey. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I had not seen him since college days, I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was unobtrusively making a name for himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiochemistry. I corresponded with him quite fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently, so it happened that I knew about his new proc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ess for extracting radium salts from the ores. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his first great step toward his goal, for it gave him mate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rial to work on. Incidentally it brought him fame and</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerably more money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was several years after this initial discovery of his,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the events occurred leading up to the Great Inva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. My first intimation of anything unusual was</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I was called into the office of the Secretary of War.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I entered, he was sitting at his desk frownin'g and</seg><seg type="columnLine">petulantly hitting the corner of his desk with an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely thin piece of metal about six inches by four.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I came into the room he jumped up and stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the piece of metal out at me accusingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks like a piece of metal," I answered flippantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Feel it," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it was my turn to gasp. The sample was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">light and it had a peculiar greyish sheen to it. When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to bend it, I found to my surprise, that, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little sheet of metal was almost incredibly thin, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">resisted my utmost efforts to bend it. In some ways it</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded me of spring steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A new alloy," I breathed, and turned to the Secre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary eagerly. "What is it?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw up his hand impatiently and sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather wearily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's for you to find out," he said. "That's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most important job we've ever turned over to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did you get it? Is there some more?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaned over his desk and pointed his finger at me</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Young man, that little piece of metal has already</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost us the life of two of the best men we ever had.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's more dangerous than if it were high explosive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more valuable to us than if it were made of diamonds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, why?" I interrupted. "Is it-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waved my interruption aside impatiently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of the best spies we ever had got wind of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that something was strange about a little island off</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japan. He posed as a tourist but was politely but firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">steered away. Naturally that only increased his de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termination to find out what was going on. He and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two other men got there in a motor boat and holed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a little cove on one end of the island. Here is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">typewritten report of the operator who survived and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out with the sample of alloy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took the typewritten manuscript rather gingerly. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was used to danger of various sorts, but somehow this</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be a sort of cold-blooded affair. The man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uscript ran as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Report of Operator BXV3</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is a resume of recent happenings on Island-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(The name had been eliminated) off the coast of Japan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Operator BXV8 was the first to discover the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was unusual activity on this island and myself and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Operator BXV5 were ordered to report to him with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large motor boat on the night of June 16th. This we</seg><seg type="columnLine">did as ordered, and picked him up. After several hours'</seg><seg type="columnLine">run, we docked in a little rocky cove at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island. The place was deserted and we managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceal our boat. Leaving BXV5 on guard, BXV8</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I went to look over the ground. We found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center of the island there was a large plant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort. Owing to guards, we were unable to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">very close but BXV8 tried it alone. When he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to me in the early morning, he told of a large plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, he said, was engaged in the manufacture of parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out of a sort of grey metal. He said that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance must be incredibly light, because he had ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served a small Japanese pick up an enormous bar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. He also said that the metal was made in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small building that seemed to require an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of electric current, judging from the dynamos.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said that he would risk getting a piece of it the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. We spent the day safely hidden and that eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning BXV8 went after a sample of the queer metal. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied him part of the way and waited for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the night. It was early in the morning when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he returned with several soldiers after him. He received</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bullet through his lungs but he managed to get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. He died there but he gave me the piece of metal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shot two of the soldiers, and succeeded in getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the boat. BXV5 had the motor going imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately. Unfortunately BXV5 was shot by a soldier</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we were leaving, but I managed to get picked up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steamer. I then managed to get here without mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hap. I believe that I was traced by the Japanese, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause there was an attempt at assassination as I left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steamer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Respectfully submitted--BXV3.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked up from the report and handed it back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Secretary with a puzzled frown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I suppose you want me to analyze this sample,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and duplicate the alloy if possible?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose you realize what a metal as light and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong as this one means to aviation." Without waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my answer, he continued. "It means that Japan</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be able to take the leadership in aviation. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only that, but if she builds airplanes with body, wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and engine made out of this material, she will be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to launch a fleet against us that we will be unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">defend ourselves against. With naval carriers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes that can carry an enormous weight of fuel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japan can sweep far inland to our great cities and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wipe them off the map. Wkh the United States un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared, Japan can establish a base in Canada or in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the Northwestern states. Before we can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to defend ourselves, their new planes will sweep</seg><seg type="columnLine">us off the face of the earth, or at least bring us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But our own planes," I protested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waved his hand wearily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Planes built of this stuff can outmaneuver us. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes will stand greater strain than ours. Our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily built planes will be swept aside like tissue paper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What we must do is duplicate this alloy and build a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fensive fleet. That or find a new means of defense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first named is your job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waved a hand in dismissal and I left the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my precious sample. Outside, tour guards fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">in behind me. I realized that I had become an import-</seg><seg type="columnLine">664</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ant personage since I had charge of the alloy. Inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dentally, it might have been an accident, but my car</seg><seg type="columnLine">was run into by a large car driven by a Japanese chauf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feur. I luckily escaped injury, and my guard, follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in another car, quickly rushed me to the laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps you can imagine my surprise when I learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the new alloy was composed principally of lead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">True, there were a few other components, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of relatively little importance. All my attempts</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the next week to duplicate the alloy failed. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">concluded that it was a new crystalline allotropic form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lead. In some way, the Japanese had discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to crystallize the lead in such a form as to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">it this extremely strong feature, even though it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very thin and light. I concluded that the atomic struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture must be very unusual to give it such properties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My conclusions were verified when a small piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alloy was put under a pressure of many thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmospheres. The result was a drop of ordinary lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many times less volume than the original piece. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved my crystalline theory, because pressure always</seg><seg type="columnLine">tends to put a substance in the denser form. An ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample of this is the fact that pressure lowers, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">freezing point of water, thus tending to keep the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. the denser, or liquid, state.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this dilemma, my thoughts naturally turned to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">old friend Harvey Wilkins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I was puzzling over the matter, an assistant</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in with a report that decided me. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">working on the atomic weight of the lead and he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported to me that it had an atomic weight of 206. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">night I took the night air-express to Arizona.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I may explain here that 206 is the atomic weight of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance which is identical in every way with lead ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept for the atomic weight and a very little difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the density. Ordinary lead is 207.2 while the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">other "kinds of lead" identical in every way, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for atomic weight and density, have atomic weights of</seg><seg type="columnLine">206 and 208. These are called isotopes and they result</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the disintegration of radium and thorium respec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I confess that the thing was entirely beyond me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't figure out where they could have got such</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous quantities of lead with an atomic weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">206. I knew that way back in 1915, lead from all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world had been collected with results that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked at 207.2.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was midnight before we made out first stop and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got hold of a newspaper. I was shocked to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlines shrieking that "War Clouds Threaten."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The account said that there had been some trifling mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding over some Japanese in California, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Japan was demanding an explanation in very bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligerent tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I also noted, down in one corner, that an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet of Japanese "tramp steamers" was now more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">half way across the Pacific, "destination unknown" but</seg><seg type="columnLine">"believed to lie headed for South America."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS we walked, I took in the beautiful scene which</seg><seg type="columnLine">■ lay before my eyes. Harvey had picked an ideal</seg><seg type="columnLine">location. In the background, lofty mountains reared</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves against the rising sun. The flying field was</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and narrow and had several hangars at one end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the edge of the field, as I have said, stood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratories and living quarters. These I now had op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity to observe more closely. All the buildings</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were built of grey concrete with very little attempt at</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornamentation. None were over two stories in height,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except one which had a small observatory tower on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one end of it. It was to this structure that Harvey led</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. He took me to what I guessed to be his own private</seg><seg type="columnLine">"den."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down and make yourself at home," Harvey said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then excitedly, "Do you know, I think I've got my</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem nearly solved?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I confess that I was a little brusque.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Small good it will ever do you," I said. "In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of weeks we'll all be working for the Japs--</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of us who aren't dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harvey looked a little hurt but he politely asked me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to "spill my tale of woe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harvey sat silently, thinking for a while, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked me questions about the alloy. I showed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">my sample and he became quite excited over it, firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">question after question at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What we want," I said, "is something that can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">used for defense. The alloy is of little use now. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japan may have declared war already."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give me the list of properties," he said, quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It may be of some use. I'm not a magician, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gave him the list of properties of the alloy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him run down the list from specific gravity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">melting point, tensile strength, and so on to the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">one that I had jotted down--the atomic weight of 206.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard him gasp and he looked up suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is this atomic weight of 206 well established?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think your problem is solved," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How--when--why ?" I gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He held up his hand soothingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us go out and see how "Bird" is coming along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew then that he would say no more. In some</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways Harvey Wilkins was a very obstinate man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we walked out on the field we noticed that every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was excited. They all seemed to be watching a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small black spot that hung motionless up in the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It works, Dr. Wilkins, it works!" a man exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew it would," Harvey said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until a little later that I realized that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was present at the first flight of "Bird" Howard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heliocopter. Of course there were many heliocoptera</seg><seg type="columnLine">before his time, but they were only the forerunners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The machine that I saw that morning was the first of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new type. When he landed, I took the opportu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nity to examine it and its maker closely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bird" was just a slender, fair-haired boy, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only two years graduated from an aviation college. He-</seg><seg type="columnLine">had won a special two-year scholarship and had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to continue his work on research in aviation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His ship was not as stable nor as large as later ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was a fairly good machine. It had an octagonal</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform about twelve feet wide. Underneath this plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form there were eight rods, which supported the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine as it landed. Each rod slid in its setting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed the machine to settle down gently on four</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels. The rods could then be drawn up to allow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine to be wheeled close to the ground. The plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form had a sort of observation cockpit with the controls</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was built in the middle of it. At the front and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on each side were propellers to propel it forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the back was a fourth propeller to pull the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREAT INVASION OF 1955</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">665</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chine backwards in case the pilot happened to over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot his mark. A large fin, sticking out at the back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the fourth propeller, was the only provision that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see for directing the machine, although I later</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that it could turn around much more quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any ordinary airplane, by the simple process of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting out one of the side propellers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The most novel innovation, however, was the lifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">device. Extending above and to each side of the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form were two rather small wings and above these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at least a dozen propellers of various sizes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapes. Most of the motors controlling all these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">located in the steel framework above the platform and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even with the stubby wings. I also learned that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a gyroscope in the center of the platform that acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a stabilizer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "--Just a rickety old boat," Bird was saying ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultantly, as we came up.

He turned to me just</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You better get a few hours sleep," he advised. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">I judge that contraption rightly, we are going to need</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves of steel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that he left me and I went slowly back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">den, and, strangely enough, I slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's go," was all Harvey said six hours later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went out with him and together we got into a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin monoplane which was warmed up and waiting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as its pilot had it headed for Seattle, Harvey lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and calmly went to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hung over the radio, eager to learn the latest de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopments in the controversy with Japan. As I tuned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in on one of the national news-broadcasting stations, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the announcer say, "Matters are rapidly approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a crisis. War with Japan is inevitable. Their de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mands lead to the belief that they wish to force war</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the United States. Great Britain, as a whole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishes to keep neutral but Canada is bringing every</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure to bear to throw her forces in with us. Seattle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tacoma, and other coast cities are being evacuated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planes are being mobilized on Felt's Field, the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">airport at Spokane. No attack is expected immediately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the fleet is coming north. Hawaii and the Philip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pines are making frantic preparations for war. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japanese fleet is reported to be sailing eastward. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">most immediate fears result from a large fleet of Jap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anese ships, supposedly merchant tramps, which were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ('About 100 miles.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reported to be sailing for South America. It now ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pears that they are further northward than that destina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion would indicate. If they are hostile, it will be known</seg><seg type="columnLine">within twenty-four hours, for by tomorrow afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will be within striking distance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the most important news that the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to offer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that one man lying there, peacefully asleep, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">intending to check the supreme power of a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We arrived at a small flying field near Seattle some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time during the night Harvey and I were busy from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time until morning, arranging everything and get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting things ready for Bird. He and his companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived with the dawn and they showed no bad effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their strenuous trip. ^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we got here," he greeted us, brightly. "Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop to get the tanks filled twice, and once for engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble, but that was all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it was that I got my first view of the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was to save the United States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't very much to look at. It was a tube about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three feet long with a large bulb on the lower end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whole thing was mounted on a swivel base which</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted it to be pointed in any direction. Appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently it was made of fused sand--silica--and it was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly clear. The lower part of the tube was sheathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with what appeared to be layers of several metals, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outermost material being lead. I could not see, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sheathing what was in the lower bulb. Two wires</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected the bulb with a generator. This whole ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus was soon fastened securely on the platform of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heliocopter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now there is nothing to do but wait," said Harvey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We will be notified by radio of the approach of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think the nervous strain told on all of us except</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harvey. While Bird and his companion fussed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolts and engines; while I paced up and down; while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pilot of the plane that brought us, Buck Walters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung over the radio, Harvey lay on his blanket, chew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on a straw and gazing up into the blue of the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Walters stood up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The first fleet is coming," he said quietly. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are still out about a hundred miles and our own air-fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">will meet them near the shore of Puget Sound, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can have the help of the shore batteries. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves us the space between. Good luck to you. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">do my part if they don't get me. Goodbye."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He silently walked over to his plane. Though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never came back, the name of Buck Walters will always</seg><seg type="columnLine">be remembered as the only American aviator to die in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Invasion of 1955. His body was never recovered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but if you visit Seattle, you will find there a bronze</seg><seg type="columnLine">monument with the words on it "He did his duty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Walters' plane left the field, our own motors</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared and Harvey and I fastened a sort of harness on</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves. Up, up we went, with hardly a jar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long it took, I don't know, but it seemed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours before we could distinguish that first grey line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes. Before we could see them, we could see Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming back in his plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rapidly we dropped to a height a couple of hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">meters above the enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime, Buck was off to one side of us a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile or so and almost as high as we were. Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that I saw that his mission was to lay a wide smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">666</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">screen in front of the oncoming fleet of planes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, the grim grey line appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steadily, without a tremor, Harvey aimed his tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one end of the grim, grey line and swept the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of it. As though an invisible knife had shorn</seg><seg type="columnLine">through them, the line melted away. Parts of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes disappeared, some vanished completely, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">one escaped. Falling toward the Sound was a silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet of liquid with the pilots kicking as they fell. Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">times Harvey swept that line and five rows of ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down into the Sound. Then Walters, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been circling above, looped the loop and we knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">our work was done for the moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty minutes later the second fleet followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first into oblivion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was during the annihilation of the third fleet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we came near disaster. Two planes apparently decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rise to higher altitudes and they saw what happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their first line of ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without hesitation, one of the ships dived at us. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only Bird's sudden drop that saved us. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already finished the second line of planes when we felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom drop out from under us. When our drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">was checked, the third line of ships was out of the cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ship that had tried to get us was swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">around to try again. Although Harvey was badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken, he managed to pick it off in mid-air and then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the rest of the ships before they could come within</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing-distance. We had been rising and managed to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose of the fourth row of planes before it got very far.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly we began to drop again and I looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the second of the two planes that had been above</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, coming straight down at us in a power dive. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at this moment that Buck Walters showed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroism. How he got off to one side, I never knew, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came in like a flash of light to collide with the Jap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anese pilot a scant twenty meters above our heads. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two planes hurtled by us carrying two brave men to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their deaths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the high point of the whole episode. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped out the remaining planes with little difficulty, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then went homewards to receive the plaudits of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was nearly a week before Harvey and I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape from a too-grateful public. Then it was that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down and said, "Now, out with it, Harvey! How</seg><seg type="columnLine">does that tube of yours work?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he said making himself comfortable. "It all</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes back to a day at college when you laughed at me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">First, though, what is your idea of atomic weight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," I replied slowly, knowing that Harvey would</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell things his own way. "An atom of oxygen is arbi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trarily set at 16 and every other element is judged by it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For example, an atom of helium is just one-fourth as</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy as oxygen so it is called 4.00. Every other one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ninety-two elements is compared to oxygen from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lightest element, hydrogen, which is 1.008, up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uranium, the heaviest, at a little more than 238."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very good," commented Harvey, with a smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You've learned a little since we left college."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	threw a cushion at him and he carefully tucked it</seg><seg type="columnLine">under him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, I suppose you know that there is a theory that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all atomic weights except that of hydrogen are whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers. For example, chlorine, usually called thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five and a half is really a mixture of atomic weights of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">isotopes one of 35 and another of 37.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Prout, as far back as 1834, thought that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">elements were built up from hydrogen atoms. Later, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was found that helium and hydrogen nuclei were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">stable, it was decided that all elements were made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">of combinations of nuclei of these two elements. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom is made up of a positive nucleus and a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">negative electrons revolving around it. The electron</seg><seg type="columnLine">only weighs one eleven-hundred and fortieth of a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">positive nucleus or proton. The loss of the extra weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hydrogen atom above one is accounted for by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory that it is converted into energy, since according</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the theory of relativity, mass may be changed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy. Do you follow me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm even ahead of you," I grinned back at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now to go back a bit, what do you know about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decomposition products of uranium."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not much," I confessed. "Go on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, uranium decomposes rather slowly. Half of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">decomposes in five million years, giving off a helium</seg><seg type="columnLine">nucleus. Half of the product, uranium X1} decomposes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in about three weeks, giving off one of the four extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrons left on it by the helium nucleus, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">product, uranium X2, again gives off an electron, half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it decomposing in about one and a quarter minutes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This third new element, uranium 2, has the same atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight as uraniums Xj and X2, and is therefore an iso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tope of these. Then a helium nucleus comes off giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">ionium. Ionium gives off still another helium nucleus</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the product is radium. Is my monologue getting too</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry for you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not too dry," I answered, "but I think it's getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">over my head."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled and went on, "Radium, as I suppose you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, has a half-time decomposition of two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. Well, it and its products, by emission of alpha</seg><seg type="columnLine">particles (charged helium nuclei) and by Beta particles</seg><seg type="columnLine">(unit charges of negative electricity) manage to result</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally in a product which cannot be distinguished from</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary lead except that its atomic weight is 206 in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of 207. Now, I reasoned that the lead could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved over two places in the periodic table by the loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a helium nucleus. It should be easier to break down</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ordinary lead, which is a mixture of the two iso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">topes 206 and 208. A shift like that would result in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">changing lead to-."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mercury!" I burst in eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," he smiled. "I built myself a cathode tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">using a uranium target a cathode of my own composi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of radioactive material. Well, it worked on radio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">active lead but on no other kind. Its effect was to cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">one helium nucleus to leave the lead. I haven't got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">process perfected yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Japanese evidently found some way to separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead into its two isotopes and then a way to crystallize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lighter form into this strong and extremely light</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. I think that the other things in your sample were</seg><seg type="columnLine">just impurities, probably remaining from the separa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spread out his hands and shrugged his shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's about all.

Here is my solitary complaint; in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">May issue you published a story, "The Doubt";</seg><seg type="columnLine">though quite a good story, there was not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">iota of scientifiction in it. How would w»</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel when on going into a shop for a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves we were offered socks, maybe good socks</seg><seg type="columnLine">but unsuitable for hands?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was interested in R. W. Haysen's theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the conservation of heat energy by getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shadow of an astral body. This hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens to be in my line of study so I will en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavor to explain as best as I can where he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong. His main fault lies in the concep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of heat as being something material, "heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">particles or electrons" as he calls the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission of heat, being radiated or reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It has been definitely established that heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">is another form of that omnipresent phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenon "Wave Motion" without which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would lack heat, light, or sound. The nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heat, briefly, is this: heat or infra red rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie in that part of the spectrum between radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">and visible light rays; these waves are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of the compression and rarefaction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ether at such a frequency that they ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celerate the movement of atoms, thus causing</seg><seg type="columnLine">inoreased frictional energy or atomic vibrations</seg><seg type="columnLine">which reflect the waves, or part of them, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest being absorbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now let us see what would probably happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our hypothetical "sky-pilot"; firstly, he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shadow of a planet so that he cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">receive any benefit from the sun's rays; sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ondly, the temperature of space is assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be absolute zero, (--450 degrees centigrade I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think) and thirdly, the body has got to be kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">above a certain minimum temperature for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper functioning, such as blood circulation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The only way our pilot could live would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bottle himself up with the vacuum flask</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle, for Nature abhors inequalities and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think of this fellow trying to keep off freez-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing by creating or preserving a body tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of say 60 degrees F. with surroundings</seg><seg type="columnLine">at about "800 degrees below" is like thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trying to drive the Leviathan at full speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a domestic coal fire. In fact, his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">may dissolve for 'tis said that at absolute zero</seg><seg type="columnLine">all atomic movement ceases so that our en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terprising friend would find his body resolving</seg><seg type="columnLine">into chemical formulae. Not that I am try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to ridicule R. W. H.'s theory or himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it has often proved to be the tyro who</seg><seg type="columnLine">has shaken the authorities out of a recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">rut of thought into the right direction. Any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, it has provided me with some thoughtful</seg><seg type="columnLine">exercise to marshal concrete evidence of where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he goes off the trail. And now, Haysen, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your chance to get back at me, for the bee</seg><seg type="columnLine">has flown from my bonnet on that knotty prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem, Gravity, in itself a grave subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As most of us know there are two forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting on us from Mother Earth, centrifugal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and centripetal force or gravity. Centrifugal</seg><seg type="columnLine">force is accounted for by the mechanical in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ertia theory but not so gravity, this mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious force not only counteracts the enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous centrifugal force that must exist but also</seg><seg type="columnLine">retains a tremendous surplus of energy (sighs</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the world's budget balancers).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There seems to me to be only one possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution to this, and that is: it is nothing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor less than an extreme form of wave mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. For an analogy we can compare its fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quency with respect to the known waves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether's density with respect to ordinary mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. I do not mean to infer that ether has</seg><seg type="columnLine">an infinite density for that would be a futile</seg><seg type="columnLine">argument.

The temperature of space is absolute zero.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Space is a perfect vacuum.

It is a law of earth that "Nature abhors</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vacuum."

I wish to elaborate this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Entropy is defined as the total quantity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat in the thermodynamic system divided by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the average temperature. By this is meant -the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unavailable heat energy. Let us take a body</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has a temperature of 20° C. and which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is constantly receiving heat by radiation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolute temperature of space is --273° C.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The entire temperature between --273* and</seg><seg type="columnLine">20* is unavailable for any use. It is this heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is called entropy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I assume that in any system, whose tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perature increases at a regular rate, the entropy</seg><seg type="columnLine">will also increase regularly. This regular in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease of entropy is time. Now, if the temper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ature is increased suddenly, or at variable</seg><seg type="columnLine">rates, the entropy is also increased, but at vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able rates, and the flow of time is not regular.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore, it may be possible to bridge a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of time in a short while, if a way is</seg><seg type="columnLine">found to Increase the entropy of the system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the same issue, Mrs. Tuckerman writes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that an absolute Zero Is impossible in inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar space.

JULIAN GRAY'S</seg><seg type="columnLine">RECENT CRITICISM IN OUR DISCUS-</seg><seg type="columnLine">SIONS COLUMNS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Editor, Amazing Stories:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I should like to point out a few considera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions which, apparently, have been overlooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Mr. Julian Gray in his thoughtful and well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">written criticism of science fiction in the letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns of the June Amazing Stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To begin with, it seems to me that his defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nition of literature as being exclusively a study</seg><seg type="columnLine">of human reactions and character-development</seg><seg type="columnLine">is rather narrow and limited. Literature can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, and does, many things; and one of its most</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious prerogatives is the exercise of imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on things that lie beyond human experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the adventuring of fantasy into the awful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sublime and infinite cosmos outside the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">aquarium. In this genre, of which science</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiction is one branch, the main interest lies in</seg><seg type="columnLine">other elements than mere character-reaction and</seg><seg type="columnLine">development, such as would properly be empha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized in a tale of ordinary events and condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, science-fiction can, has been, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be written with a dose attention to veri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">similitude in such matters. But for the initiate</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this type of fiction, and highly imaginative</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fantastic fiction in general, the real thrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes from the description of ultrahuman</seg><seg type="columnLine">events, forces and scenes, which properly dwarf</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrene actors to comparative insignificance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For many people--probably more than Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gray realizes--imaginative stories offer a wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come and salutary release from the somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">oppressive tyranny of the homocentric. and help</seg><seg type="columnLine">to correct the deeply introverted, ingrowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">values that are fostered by present-day "human-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ism" and realistic literature with its unhealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">materialism and earth-bound trend. Science</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiction, at its best, is akin to sublime and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exalted poetry, in its evocation of tremendous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">non-anthropomorphic imageries. To demand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such tales the intensive earthly observation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Hardy is idle and beside the point; and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who approaches them from this angle will miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">the true value and beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seems to me, too, that Mr. Gray makes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty sweeping statement in his remarks about</seg><seg type="columnLine">science fiction authors. Doubtless there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">hacks in this branch of writing, as in all others;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, on the other hand, there are sincere</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginative artists. One has only to name</seg><seg type="columnLine">A. Merritt (at least in his earlier work, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the original novelette version of "The Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pool"), Stanton Coblentz, who has written</seg><seg type="columnLine">some gorgeous fantastic satires, John Taine, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">master of authentic science, and H. P. Love-</seg><seg type="columnLine">c.-aft. whose "The Color Out of Space" goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">Infinitely beyond anything of H. G. Wells in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its sheer imaginative scope and creation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere.

But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since there is a fixed gulf, wider and deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Erebus, between imaginative people and</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who lack imagination, it is no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally senseless to argue this question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Certainly, however, one must admit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is vast room for improvement in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general body of science-fiction. This im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">provement, it seems to me, could lie in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of more skilful and finished writing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exclusion of the trite and overworked, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elimination of many stories which, on close</seg><seg type="columnLine">analysis, are revealed as mere gangster tales or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary adventure stories with a futuristic or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-planetary setting. A few editorial mea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sures of this sort would go far to remove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproach which can justly be brought against</seg><seg type="columnLine">science-fiction magazines. As a well-wisher, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reader--and also a writer, of this genre--I sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerely hope that such an improvement will in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time be brought' about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is one other matter that I should like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to touch upon: Mr. Gray's preliminary re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks about the general development of lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erature. To judge from these, one would think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the world's literature is marked off in</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly distinct, geological strata I and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the former, more primitive layers are now</seg><seg type="columnLine">hermetically sealed beneath a deep and solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">stratum of realism. This, however, is not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case. Romanticism, both in novels and short</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine stories, is still the most popular and</seg><seg type="columnLine">widely read genre; and as for the supernatural,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Mr. Gray puts at the archean bottom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, even that despised branch of literary en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavor is having its innings, both with writers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and readers. Apart from folk-lore, the lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erature of the supernatural is almost a modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention anyway; and some of the best work</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that genre is being done at the present time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Realism, even though it is the only form</seg><seg type="columnLine">favored by the alleged "quality magazines" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the self-appointed critical pontiffs, certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't have the field all to itself. And I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">one can safely predict that it never will. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">intolerable conditions of modern life and mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anistic civilization, will, one thinks, be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more conducive to the development of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">literature of imaginative "escape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is still another angle which occurs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, apropos of Mr. Gray's letter. After all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why shouldn't literature, or at least one literary</seg><seg type="columnLine">genre, emphasize what he calls the "inhuman,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, more properly, is tfre non-human or</seg><seg type="columnLine">extra-human?

On re-reading Mr. Gray's letter, I find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I have forgotten to mention the matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">H. G. Wells, which he brings up. Doubtless it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the particular trend of Wells' mental develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that has led him, in latter years, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandon the writing of science fiction for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sociological novels. Wells, when he wrote</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marvelous "Time Machine," "The War</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Worlds," and other fine fantasies, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">in him much of the artist, perhaps even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little of the poet. These, however, have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">progressively smothered and drowned out by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the growth of the pedagogue, the utilitarian</seg><seg type="columnLine">"humanist."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to Aldous Huxley, I have not read his</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Brave New World," which, I should judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">from reviews, is marked by the same congenital</seg><seg type="columnLine">pornography as Huxley's ordinary novels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Satire, of course, is a well-recognized function</seg><seg type="columnLine">of much science fiction, and perhaps some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has been a little too subtle for Mr. Gray's</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehension. He seems to have missed Stan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton Coblentz. of whom I have already spoken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">If I cared to.

Nothing can make a story so</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid, of whatever type it may be, as a true</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of human nature.

I must say, however, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Smith's characters are more true to life</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Mr. Campbell's. Whether or not this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to slang I cannot say, because I am sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Dr. Smith could develop his characters</seg><seg type="columnLine">without the use of any slang whatsoever. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">descriptions are far superior to Mr. Camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell's, and I believe that I am right when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">say the same thing about his characters. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Campbell, however, has a better scientific base</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his stories. At least it is better in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of modern science. But I believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Smith has taken it into consideration that</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a period of years scientific views change</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerably, because he uses very few of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern scientific concepts in his stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since an argument about scientific fiction</seg><seg type="columnLine">must necessarily employ quite a bit of beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the bush, I think that it would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good idea to use a few known facts--not</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures. I believe that I, too, could set up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very great probability against the molecular</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion drive, but why argue about how many</seg><seg type="columnLine">angels can stand on the head of a pin? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">main thing is that two of the assumptions on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Dr. Smith's story is based are now actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific facts. In the Cavendish laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Cambridge University. Dr. Coekcroft and</seg><seg type="columnLine">E. T. S. Walton have shattered the atom with</seg><seg type="columnLine">only 100,000 volts, and they obtained energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">equivalent to 16,000,000 volts. Whether or not</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a corresponding decrease in amperage</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do not know, because the details of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment are secret; nevertheless, the fact re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains that atomic disintegration of the lighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">elements is an actual fact. It is also reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Ft Worth, Texas, that an inventor has</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in imprinting upon fine steel wires</seg><seg type="columnLine">both sound and televisional impulses. A me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanical educator is not so highly improbable</seg><seg type="columnLine">either.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, Sir Campbell, have any of your basic</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumptions come to pass?
