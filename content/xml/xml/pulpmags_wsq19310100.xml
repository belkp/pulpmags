        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> It was not the gesture of an artist. It reminded</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">cannibal had just returned with his enemy's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">head. But why, he asked himself, should he feel</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about this man of genius precisely as he had felt</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about a black savage?</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Helmer walked quickly to the other side of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">room and turned a corner into a little recess.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Vaux, accustomed to the semi-darkness of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">laboratory, was dazzled for a moment by the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">profusion of light in the niche. The radiance,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from some source not discernible at once, played</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over the most marvelous piece of statuary he had</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">FOR a moment he gazed in admiration. Then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a vague, an inexpresible feeling of positive</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">disgust began to creep over him. The human</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">figure, naked from the waist up, and wearing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">conventional attire from the waist down--truly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a curious combination--was entirely too realis-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tic. Frozen on the gleaming metal face was an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">expression of intense suffering, and all the marks</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of great bodily fear were visible in the sharply</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">drawn lines of the countenance. It was this face</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that made the statue different from any Vaux</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had ever seen. True, there is a great ideal of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suffering depicted on the face of Laocoon, in that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">famous piece of statuary which shows him and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his sons in the coils of serpents. But the master-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">piece of Hellenistic art never touched the depths</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of fear and pain on the face of this statue of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">metal.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "What a horrible thing!" exclaimed Vaux.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Horrible?" echoed Helmer. "My dear boy,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on my word as an artist, I tell you this is a mas-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">for this work! The face is too horribly human</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I had a model, all right," said Helmer,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rubbing his hands with relish. "He was a man</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who had loved much--and also suffered much--</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "Why are the eyes closed?" asked Vaux.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> "The closed eyes and the lips slightly open</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Vaux continued to stare at the statue. He</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">per. Then, as he peered more closely at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">face, a sudden shock went through his system.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It couldn't be! He stared again. Helmer was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">watching him narrowly. Out of the twisted, tor-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tured lines of pain that composed the face, Vaux</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was trying to imagine what the features would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be like in repose. His eyes narrowed to blue</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slits. He had heard once that artists look at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pieces through half-closed eyes, in order to get</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the full effect. That anguished face--detached</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the body--fascinated him. Then, in some-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing like a flash of inspiration, the whole in-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">credible thing was exposed, as in a blinding</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Vaux hoped he exhibited no symptoms of sur-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was being subjected. Now that the first shock</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of recognition was over, he examined the fea-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Yes, there could be no mistake about it. The pe-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> After a bit he felt a vaporous cold as though</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The temperature was cold, but it was not the dry</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and then he saw that there was ice. A great</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">berg lifted almost in front of him. He had to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">paddle swiftly to keep from ramming his log</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into it. It swelled and grew, heaving up from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beneath until it caught him and hi? log and lifted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them high above the water. He stood upon its</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">glassy surface and endeavored to get his log</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">back into the water, but all around him cake up-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on cake of ice wallowed up to cover the entire</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He abandoned the idea of the log. It was use-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">using it in a ghoulish dance. The ice was toying</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with the gasoline tank. He leaped from cake to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cake, making unbelievable speed, but he did not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">run far. There came a burst of flame-lined</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">smoke, a scattering of spluttering blaze, a thun-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dering roar. Dick stopped, sick at heart. His</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The flame spread, in a widening circle about</seg>
