                <seg type="columnLine">stock, and buildings, on a large scale. Otherwise its physique would become a</seg>

                <seg type="columnLine">the money happens to come in or can be spared. The railroad has to buy not</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">only labor but material in large quantities in order to get the best rates and terms.</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Also it must plan its work for years ahead. Five hundred miles of new rails</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">can be laid or ten thousand freight cars purchased at one time cheaper than</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">rails by the single mile or cars by the hundred. Money can be borrowed by the</seg>

                <seg type="columnLine"> Railroads study the money markets and the markets for material with equal</seg>
