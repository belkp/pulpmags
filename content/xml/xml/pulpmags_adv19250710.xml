            <seg type="columnLine">portunity to test its balance since I had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">found it. It was a very fine blue sword,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">made by one Picinino, according to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">name on the blade, and of the pattern used</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">excellent covering for the wrist and hand.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The sword was quite heavy and broad,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">more so than our sword, but the balance</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was excellent, and it was not difficult to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">first taken by members of the Scotch Archer</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Guard, and then I believe the Clans were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">armed with them by the French in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fifteen. Indeed a very fine sword, so fine</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">indeed that my good Doctor Gulf would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have stolen it, had I not seen him in the act.</seg>
