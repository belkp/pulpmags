                    <ab>Behold! he sees what no human eye has glimpsed since the beginning of time</ab>
                    <ab>He might have stepped from the frame of a Rem- brandt painting, this bewigged figure of a man so patiently making lenses and
                        squinting through them.</ab>
                    <ab>Night after night, like a child with a new toy, Antony van Leeuwenhoek, seventeenth century Dutch shopkeeper, hurried home to
                        place anything and every- thing under his microscope: the brain of a fly, rain water, a hair, pepper, a cow's eye, scrapings
                        from his teeth.</ab>
                    <ab>Then one day, behold! he sees what no human eye has glimpsed since the beginning of time. Fantastic "little animals",
                        thousands of them to a pin-point, dart and squirm as he gazes.</ab>
                    <ab>Not for an instant did he suspect any of them as foes of mankind, as possible destroyers of health and life. But the enemy had
                        at last been sighted. Man had taken his first faltering step in the war on germs.</ab>
                    <ab>Nearly two hundred years were to pass before the second step, a giant stride, was taken by Pasteur. He devoted his life to
                        seeking out the microbes which he believed to be the cause of disease. In turn, his work inspired Lister to use carbolic acid
                        in combating the almost inevitable gangrene which then followed surgery.</ab>
                    <ab>Soon Lister's fame as "the father of antiseptic sur- gery" spread across the Atlantic. No wonder that when a new, non-caustic,
                        non-poisonous antiseptic and germicide was discovered in St. Louis, its sponsors named it Listerine, in his honor.</ab>
                    <ab>Today the shining bottle and amber color of Listerine Antiseptic are as familiar to millions of people as the face of a long
                        trusted friend. In more than sixty years of service in the fight on infection, it has day after day proved deadly to germs but
                        harmless to tissue . . . well meriting its almost universal citation as "the safe antiseptic and germicide."</ab>

                    <ab>Why Man's Prayers Did Not Stop Hitler</ab>
                    <ab>Millions of people daily practice meditation, prayer, new thought and other spiritual exer- cises. For many years people of
                        good will have been praying for the overthrow of Hitler, Hiro- hito and what they stand for. Why has the an- swer been so long
                        delayed? Why do so many other prayers remain unanswered? Why does calamity often befall us in spite of our prayers?</ab>
                    <ab>Thirty years ago, in Forbidden Tibet, behind the highest mountains in the world, a young Eng- lishman named Edwin J. Dingle
                        found the an- swers to these questions. A great mystic opened his eyes. A great change came over him. He re- alized the
                        strange Power that Knowledge gives.</ab>
                    <ab>That Power, he says, can transform the life of anyone. Questions, whatever they are, can be answered. The problems of health,
                        death, pov- erty and wrong can be solved.</ab>
                    <ab>In his own case he was brought back to splen- did health. He acquired wealth, too, as well as world-wide professional
                        recognition. Thirty years ago he was sick as a man could be and live. Once his coffin was bought. Years of almost continu- ous
                        tropical fevers, broken bones, near blindness, privation and danger had made a human wreck of him, physically and
                        mentally.</ab>
                    <ab>He was about to be sent back to England to die when a strange message came--"They are wait-ing for you in Tibet." He wants to
                        tell the whole world what he learned there under the guidance of the greatest mystic he ever encoun- tered during his 21 years
                        in the Far East. He wants everyone to experience the greater health and the Power which there came to him.</ab>
                    <ab>Within 10 years he was able to retire to this country with a for- tune. He had been honored by fellowships in the World's
                        leading geographical societies for his work as a geographer. And today, 30 years later, he is still so athletic, capable of so
                        much work, so young in appearance, it is hard to believe he has lived so long.</ab>
                    <ab>As a first step in their progress toward the Power that Knowledge gives, Mr. Dingle wants to send to readers of this notice a
                        9,000-word treatise. It is free. For your free copy, send your name and address to the Institute of Mentalphysics, 213 South

                        <ab>THE sea and all that sails upon it are the life-forces behind the Aquarius man. His is the Sign of the Water-Bearer, and
                            he is a born sailor. He usually loves boats and ships and has a way with them, whether sailing them or building them. His
                            love of adventure, of travel is apt to take him to far, strange ports and places, and his gift of adaptability will keep
                            him content in whatever odd environments he finds himself.</ab>
                        <ab>Usually a quiet, easy-going person, the Aqua-rius man can be tempestuous and raging when aroused to fighting anger. He has
                            a keen sense of justice and honor and will always be one of the first to rush to the defense of the helpless. There is
                            none of the bully in the Aquarius man.</ab>
                        <ab>If unable to enter actively in the war effort, the Aquarius man may find an outlet for his talents in some field that can
                            use his genius for detail and concentrated work. He is careful, con-scientious and an excellent craftsman. And he has
                            amazing vitality.</ab>
                    </div>
                    <div type="column">
                        <cb n="02"/>
                        <ab>The Aquarius man often finds himself falling in and out of love with disturbing frequency, but once he finds the real love
                            of his life, he is con-stant and content. He makes an excellent father, partially because he remains much of a boy at
                            heart no matter how numerous his years, and partially because of his great depths of under-standing.</ab>
                        <ab>The Zodiac sign of the Water-Bearer also gives the fortunate person born under it rather special talents: He is usually a
                            very good dancer, and he is always entertaining and witty. Perhaps his most special gift is the ability to follow and copy
                            the moods of whatever person he happens to be with at the moment. This ability makes him very popular with his fellow
                            men.</ab>
                        <ab>Despite the horrors of the War, it happens to offer to the Aquarius man an outlet for his gifts of the Water Sign, and it
                            is not at all unlikely that the end of the War will find him high on top of his chosen profession.</ab>

                    <ab>The Mysterious Influence In The Air You Breathe!</ab>
                    <ab>THE SOUL OF THE UNIVERSE is in the air you breathe. Deposited in your blood--with each inhalation you take--is the intelligence
                        that directs the course of the planets through the misty reaches of space, and the strange phe-nomenon of life itself.</ab>
                    <ab>What is it that causes your heart to beat, your lungs to expand and contract? What mind directs the cells of your being, each
                        in their pur-pose--some to create bone, others tissue and hair? What consciousness pervades these vibra-tory globules-of life
                        and gives them awareness of their Cosmic function?</ab>
                    <ab>Are you one of the millions who have looked beyond yourself for some external Divine Power or agency? Have you searched in
                        vain for some outer sign or word of Divine assurance when in doubt or in need? Now learn of the unsus-pected power that exists
                        in every simple breath --and that becomes part of you. The ancient Egyptians believed that the essence of life was borne on the
                        wings of the air. The Bible pro-claims that with the first breath man becomes not just an animated being--but a "living soul."
                        Try this experiment, and prove a Vital Life Force exists in the air. When you are in pain or de-spondent take a deep breath.
                        Hold it as long as comfortable--then notice the momentary relief.</ab>
                    <ab>This Amazing Free Book</ab>

                        use it to awaken the creative powers of your mind, and for making life an experi-ence of achievement. Use the coupon below for

                    <ab>Motorists Wanted! to Make this UNIQUE Test... of Gas Savings</ab>
                    <ab>Save for Victory</ab>
                    <ab>waste not...want not install a vacu-matic gas saver Don't waste gasoline it's a weapon of war</ab>
                    <ab>up to 30% Gas Savings</ab>
                    <ab>Car Owners: You are invited to make a gas saving road test with the Vacu-matic on your own car, with the absolute
                        understanding that unless it proves to you that it will save you up to 30% on gas and improve your car perform-ance, the test
                        will cost you nothing. Investigate this remarkable discovery that trims dollars off gasoline bills--gives you worthwhile gas
                        savings--more power-- quicker starting--more miles on less gas.</ab>
                    <ab>Automatic Supercharge Principle</ab>
                    <ab>Vacu-matic is entirely different! It operates on the supercharge principle by automatically adding a charge of extra oxygen,
                        drawn free from the outer air, into the heart of the gas mixture. It is entirely automatic and allows the motor to "breathe"
                        at the correct time, opening and closing automatically to save dollars on gas costs.</ab>
                    <ab>Proven By Test</ab>
                    <ab>In addition to establishing new mileage records on cars in all sections of the country, the Vacu-matic has proven itself on
                        thousands of road tests and on dyna-mometer tests which duplicate road conditions and record accurate mileage and horse power
                        increases.</ab>
                    <ab>Fits All Cars--Easy to Install</ab>
                    <ab>Vacu-matic is constructed of six parts assembled and fused into one unit, adjusted and sealed at the factory. Nothing to
                        regulate. Any motorist can install in ten minutes. The free offer coupon will bring all the facts. Mail it today!</ab>
