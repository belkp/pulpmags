The trouble with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me was that I thought I knew so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much about Radio that I really</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know the first thing. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought Radio was a plaything--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was all I could see in it for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I Thought Radio Was a Plaything</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But Now My Eyes Are Opened, And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm Making Over $100 a Week!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> $50 a week! Man alive, just one year ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">a salary that big would have been the height</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my ambition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twelve months ago I was scrimping along</seg><seg type="columnLine">on starvation wages, just barely making</seg><seg type="columnLine">both ends meet. It was the same old story--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little job, a salary just as small as the job,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I myself had been dragging along</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rut so long I couldn't see over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If you'd told me a year ago that in twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">t;me I would be making $100 and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more every week in the Radio business--</seg><seg type="columnLine">whew! I know I'd have thought you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy. But that's the sort of money I'm pull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down right now--and in the future I</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect even more. Why only today--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I'm getting ahead of my story. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard up a year ago because I was kidding</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, that's all--not because I had to be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could have been holding then the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of job I'm holding now, if I'd only been</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise to myself. If you've fooled around with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radio, but never thought of it as a serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">business, maybe you're in just the same boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was. If so, you'll want to read how my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were opened for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When broadcasting first became the rage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">several years ago, I first began my dabbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the new art of Radio. I was "nuts"</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the subject, like many thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fellows all over the country. And no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder! There's a fascination--something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that grabs hold of a fellow--about twirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little knob and suddenly listening to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice speaking a thousand miles away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twirling it a little more and listening to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious dots and dashes of steamers far</seg><seg type="columnLine">at sea. Even today I get a thrill from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange force. In those days, many times I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed up almost the whole night trying for</seg><seg type="columnLine">DX. Many times I missed supper because</seg><seg type="columnLine">I couldn't be dragged away from the latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">circuit I was trying out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I never seemed to get very far with it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though. I used to read the Radio magazines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and occasionally a Radio book, but I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood the subject very clearly, and lots</seg><seg type="columnLine">of things I didn't see through at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, up to a year ago, I was just a dabbler</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I thought Radio was a plaything. I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized what an enormous fast-growing in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dustry Radio had come to be--employing</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands and thousands of trained men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Please say</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I usually stayed home in the evenings after</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, because I didn't make enough money</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go out very much. And generally during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening I'd tinker a little with Radio--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a set of my own or some friend's. I even</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a little spare change this way, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped a lot, but I didn't know enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go very far with such work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as for the idea that a splendid Radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">job might be mine, if I made a little effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prepare for it--such an idea never entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head. When a friend suggested it to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">one year ago, I laughed at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're kidding me," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not," he replied. "Take a look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed to a page ad in a magazine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an advertisement I'd seen many times but</seg><seg type="columnLine">just passed up without thinking, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaming it applied to me. This time I read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ad carefully. It told of many big oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunities for trained men to succeed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great new Radio field. With the advertise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was a coupon offering a big free book</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of information. I sent the coupon in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a few days received a handsome 64-</seg><seg type="columnLine">page book, printed in two colors, telling all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the opportunities in the Radio field</seg><seg type="columnLine">and how a man can prepare quickly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily at home to take advantage of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunities. Well, it was a revelation to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I read the book carefully, and when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished it I made my decision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What's happened in the twelve months</seg><seg type="columnLine">since that day, as I've already told you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems almost like a dream to me now. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten of those twelve months, I've had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radio business of my own. At first, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, I started it as a little proposition</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the side, under the guidance of the Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional Radio Institute, the outfit that gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me my Radio training. It wasn't long be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore I was getting so much to do in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radio line that I quit my measly little cleri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal job, and devoted my full time to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radio business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since that time I've gone right on up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">always under the watchful guidance of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends at the National Radio Institute. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have given me just as much help, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I had wanted to follow some other line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Radio besides building my own retail</seg><seg type="columnLine">business--such as broadcasting, manufactur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, experimenting, sea operating, or any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the score of lines they prepare you for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you saw it in AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And to think that until that day I sent for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eye-opening book, I'd been wailing "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never had a chance!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I'm making, as I told you before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over $100 a week. And I know the future</seg><seg type="columnLine">holds' even more, for Radio is one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most progressive, fastest-growing businesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world today. And it's work that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">like--work a man can get interested in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here's a real tip. You may not be as bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">off as I was. But think it over--are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied? Are you making enough money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at work that you like? Would you sign a</seg><seg type="columnLine">contract to stay where you are now for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next ten years--making the same money? If</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, you'd better be doing something about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it instead of drifting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This new Radio game is a live-wire field</seg><seg type="columnLine">of golden rewards. The work, in any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">20 different lines of Radio, is fascinating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbing, well paid. The National Radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Institute--oldest and largest Radio home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">study school in the world--will train you</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexpensively in your own home to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radio from A to Z and to increase your</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnings in the Radio field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Take another tip--no matter what your</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans are, no matter how much or how little</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know about Radio--clip the coupon be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low and look their free book over.

We all hear, frequently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that people have certain premonitions, but the trouble is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are most difficult to prove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I,	myself, have had any number of premonitions in the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my life, but none of them actually came about. In other</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, practically all of them were false alarms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nearest one that came near being a fulfillment was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">partially fulfilled and had nothing to do with myself at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had gone to Europe on the Lusitania before the War, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour or two before the boat docked at Liverpool, I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had an exceedingly strong premonition that something</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreadful was going to happen. Something did happen, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was neither terrifying nor dreadful. Something happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing bridge when it was hoisted up and the ropes broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bridge fell down with a crash, slightly injuring two</seg><seg type="columnLine">stevedores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Similar occurrences probably happen to most of us, but it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fact that most of our premonitions, if not all of them, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">come about, and if they do come about, we must call them</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply coincidences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If, in a lifetime, an individual has fifty premonitions and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fifty, one comes near to being true, it would hardly be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a convincing proof that there was any scientific reason for sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posing that an event could be registered on the human con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness hours and days before it happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other hand, the phenomenon of memory phantoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have an actual foundation of fact, and there may be some</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific basis for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The theory which I advance in connection with this phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenon, I believe, is new, and while it cannot be proven, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least there seems to be a slight scientific foundation for it, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some instances. My theory will not cover all facts in the case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, but will only do so partially.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We all know of the sensation that comes over us in the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected quarters when we have a feeling that we have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same scene or experienced the self-same thing before. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually know that we have experienced the self-same thing or</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen exactly the same scene or have done exactly the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I especially remember a particularly strong impression that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had, some years ago, when my train sped through a Midwest</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain. It was the first time that I had ever made that par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular trip, and I distinctly remember looking with amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a certain scene which composed an unusual configuration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrain, a certain little river and other landmarks. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately struck with the conviction that I had seen exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same scene some time before. The feeling was so real</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that even today I cannot rid myself of the thought that I actu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, some time in the dim past, saw that scene. Nor is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible that I did see the scene. It may have been a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand or five thousand years ago that I actually did see it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is how I account for it and how I account for similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiences that are had by most of us:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are about a billion and a half human beings on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. They live an average of forty or fifty years, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of them vanish to be replaced by a new crop. This goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, and has gone on, of course, for millions of years. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">becomes of the physical bodies after they die? We say they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are being decomposed and become part and parcel of our earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">crust again. Some are buried six feet below the ground, others</seg><seg type="columnLine">who die as in combat, adventure or otherwise perish in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, simply decompose where they fall and their remains are</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered to the four winds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whatever happens, one fact is quite certain, and that is, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our own physical makeup will be found, the actual physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains of some of our predecessors. That these remains are</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomically small, makes no difference. The fact remains that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the succeeding crops of humans, for untold ages, have decom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed, chemically, and are again chemically absorbed into other</seg><seg type="columnLine">combinations, which later on become parts of human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more. This, of course, is not re-incarnation or anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My theory, then, in short is that a certain human being, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">related to me at all, had, perhaps 5,000 years before me, seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain scene. That particular picture became engraved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his consciousness, and consequently made a record in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain. It is quite true that after death all sensations stop, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is possibly quite true that some particle of my predecessor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain may eventually find its way into my brain in the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the passage of time. For many years, this particle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried the original impression, may rest in my brain without</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting at all, but when I see a certain scene, the particle becomes</seg><seg type="columnLine">active in my brain and sends the message that I have seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular scene once before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And this is, perhaps, the most plausible explanation of sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilar occurrences which are viewed by us through our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, but through the memory phantoms of other human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">who have long died but have become crystallized into us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Offhand, this may seem a very fantastic theory, but it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly not more fantastic than the mechanics of the brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the mechanics of memory itself. When you stop to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider what memory really is, and how incessantly impressions</seg><seg type="columnLine">are made upon the brain, and that really no physical impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions are made at all, neither in our thinking nor in our mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ory, the subject probably becomes less difficult. It evolves itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to, perhaps, the vibration of certain cells in our brain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the vibration is correct, either by will or outside influences,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we then think or we can recall memories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A violent blow to our head renders us unconscious, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brain cells are probably paralyzed and can no longer vibrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same as they usually do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I give the theory for what it is worth, and while it very likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not fit all cases, it may shed some light upon a most inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting and amazing phenomenon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ifr.

The hope that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurred him on through several years of hardship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty, the hope of graduating as a physician and</seg><seg type="columnLine">having a practice of his own, now was gone. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the end of his resources. Once the medical course</seg><seg type="columnLine">was interrupted, he knew there was no hope of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to it. Nowadays the study of medicine is too</seg><seg type="columnLine">strenuous; there is no dally-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the path to an M.D.</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went straight over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the University to apply for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instructorship in Ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied Mathematics that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently been offered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the movies and in the novels, an ogre like Cladgett</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually meets with some kind of retribution before</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. The Black Hand gets him or a wronged debtor</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisons him, or a brick house collapses on his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Cladgett lived along in Collegeburg, growing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more prosperous. He was bound to grow wealthy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he took all he could get from everybody and</seg><seg type="columnLine">never gave anybody anything. He kept growing a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">grayer and a little fatter; and seemed to derive more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more pleasure and happiness from preying financi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally on his fellow-beings. And he seemed as safe as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rock of Gibraltar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, after fifteen years, a sudden attack of acute</seg><seg type="columnLine">appendicitis got him. That morning he had sat at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk and dictated letters to his directors commanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to be present at a meeting four days hence without</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail. The bank was taking over a big estate as trustee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unless each director signed the contract personally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deal was lost and with it a fat fee.

"Impossible!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Banza bowed and said nothing. With delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger-tips he felt of the muscles in the right lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">quadrant of the abdomen. He shook his head over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thermometer that he took out of the sick man's mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He withdrew a drop of blood from the patient's finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip into a tiny pipette and took it away with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was back in an hour, and Cladgett read the ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dict in his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Operation!" he yowled like a whipped boy. "I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have an operation! I'll die!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed to consider it the doctor's fault that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appendicitis and would have to have an operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say," he said more rationally, as an idea occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. "Do you realize that I've got an important</seg><seg type="columnLine">directors' meeting in three days? I can't miss that for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any operation. Now listen; be sensible.

He felt his shoulder touched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down and eat with me," invited his unnoticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, hello Bookstrom!" he cried warmly, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived who it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello yourself," returned Bookstrom, now portly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cheerful enough, with a little twinkle in each eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what's the matter?

It was an unethical thing to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand, but he was a clever enough psychologist to sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">and respect Bookstrom's reasons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've found a specialist," he announced, "and am</seg><seg type="columnLine">personally convinced that he can do what you want.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the next two days quiet in bed and subsequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">care in diet, you can get to the meeting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead then," moaned Cladgett.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But this man wants a thousand dollars, and insists</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his thousand and mine must both be paid in ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance," said Banza meekly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cladgett rose up in bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you doctors are a bunch of robbers!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted. Then he groaned and fell back again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">appendicitis was too much for him. A pain as sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained and long-enduring as that of an acute appendi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citis will compel anyone to do anything. Soon Cladgett</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a nurse were in an ambulance speeding toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">University, and Banza had two checks in his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bookstrom was all ready.' A half dozen simple sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gical instruments to suffice for actually detaching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appendix, were sterilized and covered. He put Clad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gett on a long wooden table and asked the nurse to sit at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head with a chloroform mask, with orders to use it</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he complained. He directed Banza to scrub his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Beside Cladgett was the "elevator."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There wasn't much to the machine. All great things</seg><seg type="columnLine">are simple, I suppose. There were three trussed beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">of aluminum at right-angles to each other, each with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder and plunger, and from them, toggles coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">together at a point where there was a sort of "universal</seg><seg type="columnLine">joint" topped by a mat of thick rubber. That was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean for me to get on that thing and be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shoved somewhere into nowhere-?" Banza looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">worried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't insist," Bookstrom smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No thanks," Banza backed away with alacrity. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him whatever anesthetic he needs." Banza was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE APPENDIX AND THE SPECTACLES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">777</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt uncomfortable with responsibility, for the patient</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seriously ill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine!" Bookstrom seemed to be enjoying the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion thoroughly. "I still know how to whack off an</seg><seg type="columnLine">appendix. That's elementary surgery, amateur stuff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A storm of protest broke from Cladgett.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't want to be operated. You promised-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he wrung his hands and beat his heels upon the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We promised," said Bookstrom sweetly, "that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not open you up. You'll never find a scratch</seg><seg type="columnLine">on yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cladgett quieted down. Bookstrom scrubbed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, and wrapped his right one in a sterile towel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to manipulate the machine. He stepped on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber mat, and in a moment, Dr. Banza and the nurse</seg><seg type="columnLine">were amazed to see him click suddenly out of sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Click! and he was not there! Before they recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their astonishment, Cladgett began to complain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Banza had to start giving chloroform. He gave it</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly and cautiously, while Cladgett groaned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed and threshed himself about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lie still, you fool!" shouted Bookstrom's voice in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a preoccupied way, just beside them. It made their</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh creep, for he was not there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually the patient quieted down and breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply, and the doctor and the nurse took a breath of</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief, and had time to wonder about everything. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was another click! and there stood Bookstrom with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tray of bloody instruments in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pippin!" he exclaimed enthusiastically, pointing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appendix. It was swollen to the size of a thumb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with purple blotches of congestion, black areas of gan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grene, and yellow patches of fibrin. "You're not such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bad diagnostician, Banza!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put it in formalin-to show him how sick he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was," suggested Banza.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll have a fat time proving to anybody that that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taken out of him. Forget it, and deposit your</seg><seg type="columnLine">check. Some day when you get up your nerve, let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">show you how it feels to see the inside of a man, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once, everything working."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CLADGETT was much better the next day. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain was all gone and he did not feel the terrible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prostrating sickness of the day before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as he awoke he felt himself all over for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation wound, and finding none, mumbled to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self surlily for a while. The second day his fever was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone and he was ravenously hungry. On the third day</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was merely tired. On the fourth day he went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the directors' meeting in his own car, grumbling that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never had any appendicitis anyhow, and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctors had defrauded him of two thousand dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got a notion to sue you for damages. May do it</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet!" he snarled at Dr. Banza. "I'll include the value of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my spectacles. You smashed them for me somewhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Damn carelessness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Banza bowed himself out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The next time he needs a doctor," he said to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, " he can call one from Madagascar before I'll go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Dr. Banza was no different from any other good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">physician. It wasn't two weeks before Cladgett called</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and again he was "fool enough to go," as he him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self expressed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time Cladgett was not in bed. He was nursing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hemispherical abdomen in an arm-chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thought you said you'd cure me of this appendi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citis!" he wheezed antagonistically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aha, so you did have appendicitis?" thought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor to himself. Aloud, he asked Cladgett to describe</seg><seg type="columnLine">his symptoms, which Cladgett did in the popular way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think it's adhesions!" he snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Adhesions exist chiefly in the brains of the laity, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the conversation of doctors too lazy to make a diag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosis." Dr. Banza's courteous patience was desert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He temperatured and pulsed his patient, gently pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pated the abdominal muscles, and counted the leuco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cytes in a drop of blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You do have a tender spot," he mused; "and pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly a slight palpable mass. But no signs of any in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectious process. No muscle rigidity. Is it getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Getting worse every day!" he groaned histrionically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What is it, doc?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Banza resisted heroically the temptation to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that he had carcinoma of the ovary, and said in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead with studied care:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't be quite sure till we have an X-ray. Can</seg><seg type="columnLine">you come down to the office?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With much grunting and wheezing, Cladgett got up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the office and up on the raidographic table. Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Banza made a trial exposure and then several other</seg><seg type="columnLine">films. He remained in the developing room for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">interminable length of time, and then came out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ci red fcicc</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well! What?" yapped Cladgett.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, just a trifling matter of no importance. Come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">get into the car with me. We'll drive over to Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bookstrom's laboratory, and in a moment we'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you permanently relieved and feeling good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll not go to that charlatan again!" roared Cladgett.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you doctors are always trying to talk all around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bush and refusing to tell people the truth. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't work that gag on me! I want to know exactly!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shook both arms at Banza.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, really!" Dr. Banza acted very much em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassed. "It's nothing that cannot be corrected in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a few seconds-."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dammit!" shrieked Cladgett. "Gimme that X-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture, or I'll smash up your place!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Banza went in and got the wet film clipped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its frame. He led the way to the outside door. Clad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gett angirly followed him thither and there received</seg><seg type="columnLine">the film. Banza backed away, while Cladgett held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">negative up to the light. There, very plainly visible in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right lower quadrant of the abdomen was a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">old-fashioned pince-nez spectacles!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strange heavings and tremors seemed to traverse</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cladgett's bulk, showing through his clothes. He shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">and undulated and heaved suddenly in spots. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned alternately white and purple; his jaw worked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down, and his mouth opened and shut convulsively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">778</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">though no sound came forth. Suddenly he turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamped out of the building, carrying the wet film with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man was a pretty good judge of character,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or he never would have made the money he did. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">some subconscious way he had realized that Bookstrom</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be the man to see about this thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Banza telephoned Bookstrom at once and told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the details.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How unfortunate!" Bookstrom exclaimed. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a suspicious note in his voice. That solicitude for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cladgett could hardly have been genuine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's coming over there!" warned Banza.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall be proud to receive such a distinguished</seg><seg type="columnLine">guest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was all Banza was able to accomplish. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sick with consternation and anxiety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bookstrom could hear Cladgett's thunderous ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach down the hall. Then the door burst open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chair went down, followed by a rack of charts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tall case full of models. Cladgett seemed to derive</seg><seg type="columnLine">some satisfaction from the havoc, this time little dream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that Bookstrom was quite capable of setting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage for just such a show. "You-you-" sput-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered Cladgett, still unable to speak coherently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too bad; too bad," consoled Bookstrom kindly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's see your roentgenogram."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, how interesting!" Bookstrom could put vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiasm into his voice. "The question is, I suppose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how they got in there?" He looked back and forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Cladgett's protruding hemisphere to the spectacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the X-ray film, as if to imply that in such an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense vault there surely ought to be room for such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifling thing as a pair of spectacles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You put them there, you crook, you scoundrel, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">robber, you dirty thief!" The "dirty thief" came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a high falsetto shriek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You do me much honor," Bookstrom bowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That would be a 'stunt' I might say, to be proud of."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't deny it, do you?" Cladgett suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmed down and spoke in acidly triumphant tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It strikes me," Bookstrom mused, "that this is some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that would be difficult either to prove or to deny."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got the goods on you." Cladgett spoke coldly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as he had on that occasion fifteen years before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You either pay me fifty thousand dollars damages, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">this goes to court at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear Sir!" Bookstrom bowed gravely. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">or anyone else have a standing invitation to go through</seg><seg type="columnLine">my effects, and if you find more than a hundred dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars, you are welcome to half of it, if you give me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other half."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cladgett did not know how to reply to this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm suing you for damages at once!" His words</seg><seg type="columnLine">came like blows from a pile-driver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bookstrom bowed him out with a smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE damage suit created considerable flare in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlines. A pair of spectacles left in a patient's</seg><seg type="columnLine">abdomen at operation! That was a morsel such as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public had not had to scandalize over for some time!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Newspapers dug up all the details, even to the history</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the forced payment on the note fifteen years before</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the disappointed medical student; and the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the operation had been performed in secret and at night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the laboratory of a man who was not a licensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">medical practitioner, for Bookstrom's title of "doctor"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a philosophical, not a medical one. The public</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloated and licked its chops in anticipation of more</seg><seg type="columnLine">morsels at the trial.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But no such treat ever came off. Immediately the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit was filed Bookstrom's counsel requested permission</seg><seg type="columnLine">to examine thoroughly the person of the plaintiff. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, granted. The counsel then quietly and privately</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the judge's attention to the fact that the plain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiff's body contained no scars or marks of operation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any kind; therefore, it was evident that he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been operated upon and, therefore, nothing could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been left in his abdomen. The judge held an informal</seg><seg type="columnLine">preliminary hearing and threw the case out of court.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He admitted that there were curious phases to it, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was busy and tired, and his docket was so full that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him nervous; he was glad to forget anything that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was technically settled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cladgett continued to grow sicker. The pain and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lump in his side increased. In another two weeks he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a miserable man. He still managed to be up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a little, but his face was drawn from suffering</seg><seg type="columnLine">(and rage), and pains racked him constantly. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost twenty-five pounds in weight, and looked like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wretched shadow of his former self.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day he thrust himself into Bookstrom's office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bookstrom dismissed the stenographer and the two stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent-assistants, and faced Cladgett blandly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Banza says you can fix this up somehow," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it sounded like "gr-r-r-ump, gr-r-r-ump, r-r-ruuip!'</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've decided to let you go ahead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very kind of you," Bookstrom purred. "I ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel humbly grateful for as big a favor as that. As a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of fact, I've decided to let the Sultan of Sulu go</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump in the lake. But I've a lurking suspicion that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't going to do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cladgett sat and stared at him awhile, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked himself up and stumped out, grumbling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day Dr. Banza brought him into Dr. Book-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strom's laboratory. He eased himself down into a chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">before saying anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm convinced that Banza's right and that you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">help me. Now what's your robber's price?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a highway robber's price, with the accent on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high," murmured Bookstrom deprecatingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, out with it, you-" there Cladgett wisely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">checked himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ask nothing whatever for myself," said Book-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strom, suddenly becoming serious. "But if you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to get those spectacles out of you, right here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now you settle a sum to found a Students' Fund to loan</seg><seg type="columnLine">money to worthy and needy scientific students, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they may pay back when they are established and earn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing money. I think when you spoke to me about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage suit you mentioned the sum of fifty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars. Let's call it that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fifty thousand dollars!" screamed Cladgett in ai</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE APPENDIX AND THE SPECTACLES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">779</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">high falsetto. He was weak and unstable. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">preposterous! That's criminal extortion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"This transaction is not of my seeking," Bookstrom</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You've fixed it all up on me," Cladgett wailed, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his voice sank toward the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Tell that to the judge. Or, go to a surgeon and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have him open you up and take them out. That would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come cheaper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Operation!" shrieked Cladgett. "I can't stand an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">operation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He looked desperately at Banza, but there was no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hope there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"This seems to me a wonderful opportunity," Banza</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said, "for you to do a public service and distinguish</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yourself in the community. I'm sure that amount of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">money will not affect you seriously."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cladgett started for the door, and then groaned and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fell back heavily into his chair.

"Why, Peabody was nearly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">month getting as far as he did.

"It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps five million miles in width and fully that many</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles deep, according to the evidences of my year's</seg><seg type="columnLine">survey through telescopic photography of the drift of</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorites.

Something of this sort may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to Peabody as he neared the moon. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocket, however, I have a primitive combustion</seg><seg type="columnLine">force that will be unaffected by the electrical properties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the current and will hurl me at top speed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current while the rudder of the rocket acting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire stream will give me sharp and distinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">steerage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hurried back to the office jubilantly. Strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough Prof. Morteshang had notified none of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other television services, giving us a clean scoop. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the most of it, and the theaters of the world</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and the television service sets in millions of homes</seg><seg type="columnLine">next morning showed scene after scene of Prof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morteshang's plan and his own account of his pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed journey.

In the weeks that followed I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made trips to Gary with Prof. Morteshang where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, cigar shaped cylinder, which was to form the</seg><seg type="columnLine">casing of the rocket, was being welded from the tough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est Voicen steel, the revolutionary process which</seg><seg type="columnLine">creates steel capable of stretching like rubber rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than breaking, while still retaining its ordinary resis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance and tenacity to the fullest degree.

To gain the utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage, the start should be made from a mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">top in Ecuador, but I am patriotic enough to want it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be from the soil of the United States, so I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided on Miami."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thousands of people gathered daily about the roped-</seg><seg type="columnLine">off space in which the rocket stood, watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeple jacks crawling about like flies on the huge cyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inder two hundred feet above the ground. A coat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paint was being given the big projectile to reflect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the sun out in space and make the rocket's</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress easier to follw by the astronomers on earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose thousands of telescopes would be trained on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky for the momentous occasion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cylinder, which formed the body of the rocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on three titanic steel legs two hundred feet high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which in turn rested on a great circular steel ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the ground, making the best surface possible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrain in alighting. Halfway between the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the cylinder were steel braces which held two</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender steel rudders set at right angles to each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">and receiving their leverage to change the direction oft</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocket by the firestream shooting downward from</seg><seg type="columnLine">FLIGHT TO VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">783</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire chamber which was located in the cylinder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cost of the machine was far larger than Prof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morteshang had orignally planned. He had hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to build it for $25,000, but as it stood ready for flight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it represented an investment of more than half a mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion dollars. This, fortunately, did not represent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole or any part of his original, small fortune; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased sale of his books, his magazine articles, news</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights, and the liberal support of the Miami Chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Commerce financed the whole thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE day of departure was finally set with plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time to allow the public to arrange for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">event. Immediately tourists from all over the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to flock to Florida to be present. Air lines from</seg><seg type="columnLine">England, France, and, in fact, nearly every country in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world sent fleets of excursion planes to Miami;</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamship lines brought in their thousands; railroads</seg><seg type="columnLine">contributed their throngs; private planes from North</seg><seg type="columnLine">and South America filled all the available flying fields</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the city--not to mention the thosands of automo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">biles that jammed the roads leading toward the famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter resort. Officials reported it to be the biggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">single invasion Florida hda enjoyed since the historic</seg><seg type="columnLine">land boom far back in 1920 or thereabouts, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauties of the state were just coming into prominence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For more than a mile around the rocket space was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fenced off and reserved for the crowd which paid two</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars a head to get that near the awesome steel ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forty-eight hours before the take-off the spectators</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to arrive and enter the parking space bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their beds and meals with them. Special guards were</seg><seg type="columnLine">posted about the rocket in its inner roped-off circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">to protect it from souvenir hunters and possible dam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age.

"By the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shepherd, what are you doing this evening?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing except cover this affair," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would like to have you come over to my apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at the hotel for dinner--a strictly informal, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I might say it, a secret affair.

Prof. Morteshang admitted me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned in the best of humor, and phoned down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dining room for a most elaborate meal, which in</seg><seg type="columnLine">due time arrived and was served by a scar-faced waiter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the balcony overlooking the ocean. We ate leisurely</seg><seg type="columnLine">and settled back to enjoy our cigarets and a bottle of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the oldest champagne obtainable. Not until then did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prof. Morteshang drop his bantering air, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had maintained throughout the dinner, and become</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have been thinking about you, Shepherd," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked.

The subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one that I feel extreme delicacy about proposing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I feel bound to put you upon your honor as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman to let what is said between use here go no</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther. But I really need a partner--someone I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hesitated and cleared my throat diffidently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The secrecy part is all O.

But if you are going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer me the opportunity of going along with you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus, that is something I should have to consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">very carefully. You see, I have my mother to support,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I am sending my kid sister through college. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve me, though, I would like to go with you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, that's all out.

I ejaculated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sh! Not so loud," he cautioned. "No, I have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">intentions of leaving the earth if I can help it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the rocket--the crowds--" I floundered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That part will be taken care of, but don't forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">your promise of secrecy. Let me explain the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, and perhaps you will understand better. I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to go when I made my plans. In fact, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't intend to get more than a few miles off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's surface. The rocket can go to Venus, or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">place else it chooses, but it shall go alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stared at him, half believing he had gone suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the public will make you pay for your fun," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">protested at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean the public will pay me for its fun," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">corrected with a smile, laying his hand on my knee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let me call you by your nickname, 'Les,' and you call</seg><seg type="columnLine">me 'Ran,' and let's get real informal and confidential</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this Venus stunt, and talk it over as a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of friends. If I seem a trifle cocksure about the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair, please forgive me, for it is the first big thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have ever attempted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OW to begin at the beginning. I got this</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole idea from watching that hellish, globu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar tomb of popr Peabody floating round and round</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon. I knew him slightly--a pleasant chap who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in my astronomy class at the U. in my soph year.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I mulled over his experience a great deal, and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at some conclusions. Peabody tried to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the moon because the public wanted someone to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sacrificed his life, his savings, and left a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">widow to mourn his loss, trying to achieve that empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubble, fame, and riches, doubtful rewards that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought would be his on returning from his lunar</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure. Proof of his discovery to put on the auc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion block for the public would have been several</seg><seg type="columnLine">784</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet of moving picture film of the lunar</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains and desert wastes which could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">faked far more realistically in any studio, and I doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much whether they would have equalled the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">photo studies we have made of that body through our</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescopes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is more than Ikiely that the public would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised the cry of 'Fake!' before he had done very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much toward collecting his fortune--you know there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a considerable number of persons even now who</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that he never left the earth--and he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lost out altogether after all. His attempt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically suicide from the start, as all such adventures</seg><seg type="columnLine">are bound to be, and utterly futile.

I ought to make a million,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the public ought to learn a lesson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused. I stared at the ceiling, deep in thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where do I come in?" I asked finally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are to help me write the book and handle the</seg><seg type="columnLine">publicity, a thing you can do much better than I.

The public, I have learned, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very, very funny animal. It may fool both of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly before we are done with this affair. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll stick with you just the same."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We shook hands on the deal and drank a final glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of champagne to its success, and left the hotel for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket enclosure. I was somewhat startled to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big missile canting badly to the northwest as we made</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way through the milling crowd, and called Ran's--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was no longer "Professor Morteshang" to me--</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's to give me a better opportunity of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in my 'chute," he whispered. "Tell 'em that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed the advantage of remaining in the atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as possible to get its added resistance to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">combustion thrust. It is a legitimate reason, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE crowd broke into a mighty cheer as Ran was</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized entering the gate of the fenced off</seg><seg type="columnLine">space about the rocket. Flashlights thundered, movie</seg><seg type="columnLine">men cranked frantically and the television reporters</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced around to get the best focus possible with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sets as he mounted the freight elevator, taking me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and ascended to the door of the cylinder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we entered the control room I stared about -</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is all this paraphernalia and machinery a fake like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the idea?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bit of it," was his prompt response. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole rocket and everything connected with it--ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepting myself--is genuine and of the best materials.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't dare to fake this thing for fear the scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">might" become suspicious. And I also got a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction out of making the machine as perfect as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. As it stands a man with the inclination and</seg><seg type="columnLine">any kind of luck could actually go to Venus in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, it is nearly time to start, so I'll put on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">'chute and get my flashlight ready.

I heard the steel door</seg><seg type="columnLine">click shut behind me and saw his smiling face through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The elevator descended with a rush. No sooner had</seg><seg type="columnLine">it touched the ground than the workmen hurried me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to safety outside the 200-yard limit in which the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood grim, and awe-inspiring but beautiful under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battery of searchlights playing on it. All about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle were thousands of silent spectators crushed to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether in a black mass with their upturned faces gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I glanced overhead at the brilliantly jewelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome of the heavens waiting to receive the rocket. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">great crash startled me, although I knew what it was--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the collapse of the 200-foot elevator which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">toppled over out of the way of the rocket's base. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd swayed with excitement. The luminous dial of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wrist watch showed 8:30 o'clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A trickle of yellow flame suddenly spilled out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the steel cylinder high above us. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">flared and leaped downward to the earth with a roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Niagara, churning up the sandy soil into spray</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lighting up fiercely the thousands of ghastly up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned faces. The crowd shrank back. The roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">crescendoed into the giant diapason of a hurricane;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flame seemed suddenly longer. I became aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the rocket was already high above the earth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling off into the northwest. Smaller and smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrank the tail of fire until it became only a huge yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low star that slowly dwindled to nothing. I plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the swirling, cheering thousands to the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision broadcasting shack with its glowing tubes, whir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring machinery and bawling announcers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Astronomers in both European and American ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servatories picked up the silvery oval of the rocket as</seg><seg type="columnLine">FLIGHT TO VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">785</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it came into sunlight beyona the shadow of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and followed it far into space. It disappeared in less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than half an hour after its departure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A faint flash of yellow fire was seen some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">later which astronomers believed came from the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">--"Prof. Morteshang at this point evidently decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to increase his speed," Hyman, the Glober Television</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Broadcasting Service reporter, declared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I laughed as I listened, and wondered if that brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">surmise was not amusing Ran in his hiding place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">northwest Florida or Georgia where his parachute de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent must have carried him. Hyman had suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly throughout the affair. How he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">exulted if he had known the truth, and how he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have aired the facts before the world!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEEKS grew into months before the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in the event died down to normal. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went about my work as usual, carrying a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth induction wrist watch of forty-odd jewels which</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost the directors of the World Television, Inc., five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred dollars, and was given me as an expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their esteem for the splendid way I had handled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Morteshang affair. I must confess that my con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">science was not altogether at ease over the gift. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cidently, I was assigned to cover the return wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might occur. I enjoyed another private chuckle</seg><seg type="columnLine">over that angle of the affair, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Winter changed to Spring and Spring matured into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Summer, but no word came from Ran. Hints that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might have been destroyed by a meteorite, or have</seg><seg type="columnLine">perished from the extreme cold out in the black void</seg><seg type="columnLine">of space--or perhaps had become a satellite as Pea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body had--begun to be heard. I was becoming a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasy and was scanning every news dispatch from</seg><seg type="columnLine">South America. Then one day I received my message.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It came in a badly worn envelope, which bore the post</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark of Nome, Alaska, and was in Ran's handwriting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come at once. Need you badly--Ran." it read.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A glance at the aerial time tables showed me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tourist plane service to Alaska had been discon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued two weeks before. I could catch a De Luxe</seg><seg type="columnLine">night passenger plane for Seattle and board a steamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for the north the next morning, but decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it. The message said "Come at once." That</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant faster time than a coasting vessel, or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slower rail connections could make. I caught up my</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcoat and dashed for the elevator, dropping down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subway station sixty floors below and shot out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my apartment in Evanston where I packed my bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came hurtling back through the lower level tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a mile a minute to the Field Museum station. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pick-Me-Up Taxi hurried me out to the mail plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangars on Soldiers' Field, where I managed to board</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big mail monoplane through the use of my reporter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">card, and arrived at Nome next morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The northland was already a snow-covered, deso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late waste. I shivered in spite of the tropic warmth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big tourist hotel as I entered the lobby. Almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately a stocky, fur-clad man approached and</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduced himself as Dennis McCargell and my guide</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to lead me to Ran. He bore a letter which identified</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. We waited only long enough to purchase fur</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing for me and started on our way by dog sled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I will not dwell on the chilly, painful details of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip, excepting one incident which caused a great deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of inconvenience later. While we slept one night, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huskies, urged on by their wolfish hunger, tore, open</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pack and destroyed my portable television broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casting set for the sake of its leather casing. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing I could do except to pick up the pieces next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About a week after leaving Nome, we reached a val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley between high, snow-draped mountains within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arctic Circle, a valley wherein lay an exact duplicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Morteshang rocket under the shoulder of a hill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The machine was tipped grotesquely on its side as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it had been smashed by the impact of falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the skies. The twisted, broken landing gear was</seg><seg type="columnLine">most realistic. Quarter of a mile distant stood a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">miner's cabin with a smoking chimney. We paused on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a God-forsaken spot this is!" I exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">involuntarily. "I wonder why he didn't stick to South</seg><seg type="columnLine">America."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I checked myself and could have bitten my tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, as I suddenly recollected my stocky, dour, Scotch</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide beside me. He apparently took no notice of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, so I let them pass. We plowed our way down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hillside, and crossed the valley to the cabin. Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cargell pushed open the door and we entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced about curiously. A red hot stove stood at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one end of the big room--I was surprised at the size of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building--and beside it stood a slender girl and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man, fur-clad like ourselves. He eyed us rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">haughtily, it seemed to me. A bed stood against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall near the window close by. McCargell led me to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There he is, poor lad," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNDER the covers lay Ran with wasted cheeks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes that were bright with fever. The girl pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her way imperiously between McCargell and me to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we were doing. I glanced down at her profile</seg><seg type="columnLine">and received a distinct shock. Where the average hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man being glows with a pinkish color from the tint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood beneath the skin, her flesh showed a delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">green tint, a pale, lovely hue that was utterly entrancing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I marvelled. Her hair was long and black and shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through here and there with a dark, greenish strand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She glanced up at me defiantly with great luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, that glowed with an amber flame in their depths.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I noted, too, that her features were flawlessly beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, but her gaze made me feel uncomfortable. I hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly turned my attention to Ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was delirious from pneumonia and mumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange words and phrases as he tossed about, until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl laid a cooling hand on his forehead. He became</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet at once and fell into a fitful slumber. I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at her. Leave him to me, her eyes said as distinctly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though she had spoken the words. I obediently</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the stove and removed part of my outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">fur clothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me what happened," I asked McCargell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">786</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing much to tell," he replied stolidly, getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his pipe. "This is my cabin, and I was out pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectin' and trappin' on the other side of the range for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of weeks. When I came back I saw that big</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, whatever it is, against the hill over there</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it had been wrecked, and these folk were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">in here with the fire going. The young lad and lassie</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't talk English. There is an old woman, too, green</seg><seg type="columnLine">like they are, that's asleep in the next room where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' the lassie stay.

Then he sent me down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nome with the letter for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did he get the machine here?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do I know? I wasn't here," he countered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Must of fell out of the sky. Some kind of a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">doodad for flying over the Pole, I guess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat down perplexed. The girl rose and came to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She produced a small, red leather bound volume from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bosom of her parka (Eskimo skin garment), handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to me, and returned to the bed. I opened the book</seg><seg type="columnLine">haphazardly and glanced at a page near the beginning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Am nearing Venus on the sunny side," I read.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The glare from the fog mantle that covers the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">is terrific.

Nothing could be better for our book</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a nice, juicy diary, or log of the trip.

By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I upset the pile and retrieved it, my opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave the rocket had passed. I was already hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of miles off the earth and my speed was increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">every instant. To dive out into the frigid, empty void</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been certain suicide.

The radio set of the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been hopelessly shattered when the big machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed on the mountainside as Ran was trying to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">it down through a heavy storm to get his bearings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my portable television set had been too badly broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">up by McCargell's huskies to be repaired. So I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed myself to our fate and started to work at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the book of the great adventure, while Loama, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green girl with the emerald blood of Venus princes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her veins, nursed Ran back to health.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hers was the harder task at first when he hovered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Border Line and we all waited anxiously until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crisis had passed and he had fallen into a restful slum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber from which he emerged weak but released from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delirium. Loama, exhausted by her long vigil, slept in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her chair at the bedside, holding his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Les," he greeted me faintly with a smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he recognized me. "Knew you would come when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you received my letter. I see you know the truth about</seg><seg type="columnLine">my trip. Must have read the diary. We have our</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance now at something real instead of a paltry hoax."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should say so," I agreed heartily.

"The races of Venus have long since perfected</seg><seg type="columnLine">space navigation, and bring in rare woods, metals, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemicals from the planet Mercury, which is so hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">that human life cannot exist there for any length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. They will be coming to earth next, seeking col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onization."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why haven't they come before?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have been protected by the great cosmic cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent I told you about. The green people use an elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical force similar to an electric discharge for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">space propulsion. The peculiar electrical properties of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Great Current nullify the effects of the discharge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ships are swept away helplessly to fall ulti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mately, I presume, into the sun. No less than a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred adventurers have set forth bravely to reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth in the last score of years and have never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of since. The scientists of Venus were at a loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know what happened to them until I explained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current which had no effect on the primitive combustion</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of my rocket."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These and many other facts that are included in</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Into Darkest Space" I learned from Ran first hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he lay in his bed under the watchful eyes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green princess, who often imperiously gestured to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop talking and let him rest when he seemed a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">weary. I could never learn more than a few words of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her language, and those, I must confess, sounded all</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike, for it required the most delicate shading of tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to convey their meaning. In his book Ran says the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vocabulary of the whole language is limited to only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few score of spoken words as a base for the pyramid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most highly developed communication in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe, which is carried on by direct inference through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes--a sort of mental telepathy. The system of</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing is extremely complicated and bears no relation</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever to the spoken words although it is as capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bearing the burden of cultured literature and deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">philosophic discussion as any of the languages of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Ran learned the spoken language through hyp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">notic treatment over a period of many weeks, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">mastered the rudiments of the written language dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his sojourn on Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LOAMA and her brother, Vomi, and their old slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">i governess disdained to learn English as something</seg><seg type="columnLine">too primitive and harsh. I noticed that none of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced the slightest difficulty in making their wants</seg><seg type="columnLine">known through their expressive glances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These two children of Venus looked upon McCargell</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself at first in about the same light as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard their slaves at home, but they revered Ran as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a veritable demi-god, proving it not only by accompany-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him back to earth, but also, as those familiar with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his book will recall, by rescuing him from the Unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">Society, that radical organization of Venus scientists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which held him prisoner and determined that he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">never leave that planet until they searched and exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ined the innermost depths of his mnid by hypnosis, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">biologist might dissect a living frog. Provided the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience had not resulted in his death, Ran would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have survived it only to be a babbling idiot for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remainder of his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Knowing the resourcefulness of Loama and the utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearlessness of her brother, I do not marvel at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way they immediately armed themselves with atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray machines as soon as they learned of Ran's predica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and cut their way into the steel vault in the base-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the Cherwa Academy, where he lay helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hypnotic stupor on the raised marble slab ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first experiments of the Unknown Society in the lec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture room above. I can easily vision the blackness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night, the cold, drenching rain that begins at dusk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and continues intermittently for two hours from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhanging cloud canopy of the planet, and there un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the base of the academy wall, wet to the skin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with teeth chattering, Loama and her brother at work</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolving with their pistol-like ray controls the marble</seg><seg type="columnLine">and steel between themselves and the secret vault while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the members of the Unknown Society were gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lecture hall. How they must have hurried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seize his unconscious form between them and flee out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the street just as the lights flashed on and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor above the chamber began to open! I can ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciate, too, Loama's determination to keep Ran hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den in her own bed chamber during the ensuing excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, while court detectives under the orders of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, the king, ferreted out the names of the Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known Society and put every member to death. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no other place she could be sure of his safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Often I watched Loama's lambent eyes blaze and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap in the firelight shining from the open door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red hot stove as she dwelt among the memories of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her homeland on that other planet, where the sky is</seg><seg type="columnLine">788</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">always white and hazy under the eternal cloud canopy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and summer rules the land. The long Arctic night here</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth, with the Aurora Borealis flaming outside in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intense stillness of the deep cold, was surely con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trast enough to make her homesick. All three must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have suffered severely from the cold, although they</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuously wore the fur clothing supplied by Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cargell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUR imprisonment came to an end when the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">peeped again over the southern horizon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow on the mountain-sides started seaward</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the foaming, churning gullies and creeks. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed our stuff as soon as possible and began our</seg><seg type="columnLine">long trek back to Nome by dog sled. Ran left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithful old rocket with deep regret. It had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously damaged by the crash in landing, or by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter's cold. He said it could well be used again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loama hung on his words wistfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could scarcely wait to reach Nome and announce</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world the safe return of Prof. Morteshang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Immediately on reaching the little city, I sought out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">World Television, Inc., station there and introduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prof. Morteshang and his three companions from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus to the millions of people throughout the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who at that moment were watching television screens</seg><seg type="columnLine">in theatres and homes. Then I sought out the mail</seg><seg type="columnLine">station and made arrangements to start for Chicago on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next mail plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before we had been under way an hour, the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator began to receive messages of congratulation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">offers of theatrical contracts, requests of autographed</seg><seg type="columnLine">books and photos, and invitations to attend public and</seg><seg type="columnLine">private functions from all parts of the delighted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished world. At the Canadian border we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">met by an escadrille of municipal planes from Chicago</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escort us the rest of the way to Soldiers' Field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our escort grew rapidly from then on, as private planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">hove into view from all points on the horizon to swell</seg><seg type="columnLine">our triumphant progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soldiers' Field was crowded to capacity by cheering</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands, who even swarmed over the plane runways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving us scarcely room enough to alight. When we</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the door of the cabin and stepped out we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted by the blaring of bands and cheering of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd. Special police fought back the eager specta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors while the official committee of welcome took charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and escorted us from the field. Throughout the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatres were packed to the doors with people who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">devouring the television account of the affair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our fortune was made, and Prof. Morteshang's name</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a scientist and discoverer would go down- through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ages as immortal, it seemed. Millions of dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">in movie contracts were offered not only to him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Princess Loama and her brother as well. Ran ig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nored the offers; his companions laughed first in amuse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, then in contempt. They care nothing for silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen fame, nor, in fact, for anything of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they regarded in about the same light as that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which a confirmed New Yorker looks on life in Pata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gonia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ran's refusal came from a sincere hope that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplishment might result in the betterment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human race in the future--a view that contrasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongly with his original plan of bilking the public out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a fortune. He laughed a little shamefacedly to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that original scheme and resolved never to reveal</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to another living soul. He would probably become</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealthy as a side issue, but he resolved never to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tremendous fame as a lever to hoist himself into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vast fortune in the world of the theatre. He ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed this view at a famous banquet, harking back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into history as he did so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I often heard my grandfather tell of his boyhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories of the way the world idolized Charles Lind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bergh, the first aviator to fly from New York to Paris</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a non-stop flight," he said. "Lindebergh, or 'Lindy,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he was affectionately called, turned down numberless</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances to commercialize his great popularity, passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all by in the interests of national welfare. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in a similar position could set a higher ideal before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, than the example of that intrepid aviator."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That banquet with the presentation of the Congres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional Medal for the greatest accomplishment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">year and its accompanying $50,000, which was pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented by the President of the United States himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the high tide in the career of Prof. Marteshang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The very next morning, while listening to the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">news dispatches of the world at breakfast, I heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement by Prof. Hibbs, the Harvard astronomical</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority, that there was something strange about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing spot of Prof. Morteshang on his return from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus. It was as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The mountain in northern Alaska, it will be noted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is directly under the course taken by the rocket after</seg><seg type="columnLine">it took off in Florida. It will be recalled that Prof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morteshang started his flight at a very low angle, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">could easily have resulted in the rocket passing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alaska at a height of but a few miles above the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">before darting off into empty space. The angle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight excited quite a discussion at the time in scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">circles and there were a number of scientists who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not altogether satisfied with Morteshang's reason of</seg><seg type="columnLine">added air resistance at the start of the flight. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists still raise the question."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hurried to the Amidon Hotel, where Ran and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">proteges were staying. He had heard the statement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, and was considerably disturbed by it. We at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood the motive behind the statement. It came</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the news release of the Globe. Television and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radio Service, and I recognized in it the hand of Hy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, who had played second fiddle to me throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preparations and take-off of the rocket flight. Ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">contributed further.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That man, Hibbs, once suffered considerable em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassment from a criticism I wrote of one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">books. He has never forgiven me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIBBS' statement created no great stir, but within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week another attack was made by the "Globe"</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang. Hyman uncovered the fact that Ran had bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a parachute shortly before his departure. This bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">news, following Hibbs' statement, created a real sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">FLIGHT TO VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">789</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sation. We held a consultation and decided to ignore</seg><seg type="columnLine">the implication of fraud, but by the next day such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">controversy had arisen, that Ran felt that it was nec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">essary to come forward with an explanation, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken the 'chute as a possible safeguard against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crash landing either on Venus or the earth, a precau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on a par with the equipping of trans-continental</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger planes with 'chutes, and placing lifeboats on</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean liners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This explanation did much to quiet the controversy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we were frankly worried. Ran saw his great ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complishment threatened with destruction, and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of his ambition to take a scientific and diplo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic mission to Venus to bring about a better under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing between the peoples of the two worlds. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt existed in our minds but that the Globe Service</seg><seg type="columnLine">had planned a definite campaign to discredit Ran, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we waited nervously to see where the next point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack would be. It came from an altogether new source</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fairly made us gasp at the devilish ingenuity of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Humphreys, owner of the famous Humphrey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanitarium for nervous disorders located at Los An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geles, came forward with a statement that the peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">green color of the "so-called Children of Venus," who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been introduced to the public by Prof. Morteshang</seg><seg type="columnLine">as proof of his visitation to the planet Venus, was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown on earth, although by no means common.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Valvular trouble of the heart, which so often gives in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fants a blue color, had been known to impart to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">patients a greenish tinge, and digestive troubles often</seg><seg type="columnLine">result in the same color," he declared. "However," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">concluded, "three such ideal cases as the 'Children of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus' would be rather unusual."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We could make no reply to that. Vomi would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made an answer in his princely fashion, that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have terminated all opinions of that publicity seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">physician very suddenly and painfully if we had per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted. The inference that Vomi was sickly or diseased</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an insult to his royal blood, which in his homeland</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been erased on the field of honor or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other convenient spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The public did not become greatly excited over Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Humphrey's opinion, but the belief of fraud was grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. A score of speaking and banquet invitations</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been scheduled for the near future for Prof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marteshang were postponed or cancelled by societies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and municipalities in various parts of the country. Ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forced to call off a speaking tour through the east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern states. He raved to us, but there was nothing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could do without openly involving ourselves in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controversy, a thing I was trying desperately to avoid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another attack against us was made by Prof. Hibbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">while speaking at a luncheon of the Academy of Science</seg><seg type="columnLine">in New York. He declared the Academy had acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">prematurely in presenting its medal and $10,000 award</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Prof. Morteshang without investigating more thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughly the circumstances of the affair. The golden op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity had passed,' since such an investigation should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been made as soon as possible after the landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rocket, but better late than never. A committee</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointed by the Academy should without delay voyage</seg><seg type="columnLine">by plane to northern Alaska and look thoroughly into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the wreck of the rocket, and interview the miner, Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cargell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The assembled members considered the question with</seg><seg type="columnLine">much gravity and appointed the committee which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to start the following week in a specially chartered</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, accompanied, of course, by the usual train of</seg><seg type="columnLine">television broadcasters, moving picture men, newspaper</seg><seg type="columnLine">correspondents, and others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were dumfounded at the action of the Academy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but felt it best to maintain our policy of watchful wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. As publicity director, however, I made one excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and sent a statement to the World Television, Inc.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Prof. Hibb's dislike for Prof. Morteshang dated</seg><seg type="columnLine">back several years to a criticism of a book, treating on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hibbs' theories regarding the planetismal theory, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">criticism which was almost universally approved by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's astronomers. I was amazed and somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmed that the statement failed to appear on the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision screens. I also realized that the World Tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision had not assigned me to accompany the Academy</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition. Our position was indeed becoming precari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous. We could only await the findings of the commit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tee, which would shortly be announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT report startled the world and left us dazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in dismay and astonishment. We were all five</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated with the usual audience in the television room of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Amidon Hotel when Chairman Corsepius of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocket Investigating Committee appeared on the screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made the following statement from northern Alaska</seg><seg type="columnLine">via the portable television sets accompanying the party:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are no remains of any rocket on this mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">or in this vicinity where Prof. Morteshang and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">three green-hued companions claim to have alighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their return from Venus. Our investigating com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittee has found only a few rusty steel bridge girders</seg><seg type="columnLine">which have evidently been brought here by dog sled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Nome and unloaded carelessly at the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain, as we shall show you presently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of McCargell there is no trace. In Nome it is re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported that he appeared there shortly after Prof. Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teshang announced his return to the world.

The scene changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly to Tokyo, where, in the early morning hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a disastrous fire was raging in the geisha girls' quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters. Under cover of the screaming girls and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clanging fire apparatus, we crept out of the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried to Ran's apartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within ten minutes I received a special delivery let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter from the World Television, Inc., notifying me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my services were no longer required by that corpora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Another letter next morning was received from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the president of the Univesity of Chicago, informing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ran that his resignation would be accepted at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the remainder of the week, bell boys brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">790</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">letters and telegrams from banquet and reception com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittees all over the country, informing us that affairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">at which Prof. Morteshang was to appear had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">called off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of all this welter came one cheerful announce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. It was from our literary agent, informing us</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the sales of "Into Darkest Space" were steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounting, and the financial returns from this and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news rights with their various ramifications had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">topped two and a half millions of dollars, and in a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time would total more than five millions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ran read the statement wearily, dropped it on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, and resumed his endless pacing from one end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room to the other with his knuckles clenched be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind his back and his face disfigured by the frown he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had worn for days. He was haggard from the loss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep and appetite. Loama, seated beside me, watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">with genuine concern but without comment. Vomi</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained a sympathetic, masculine silence. Abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ran halted before us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why can't they quit hounding me?" he burst out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What have I done to deserve this treatment? Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to injure anyone? Have I not opened up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful, new phase of human experience for man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind, and am I not trying to work for the betterment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two worlds?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This persecution is only the result of jealousy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatred, of course," I assured him. "The people of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world are confused and misled. When the truth be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes known they will turn on Hyman, Hibbs and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang even more unmercifully than they have treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. You are being martyred--temporarily--but you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have'your turn. Do not feel too badly about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair, and, if need be, regard this episode only as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of poetic justice for that original foolishness you</seg><seg type="columnLine">devised to fool the public."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is what hurts the worst!" he exclaimed. "Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wonderful thing has resulted from my paltry little</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan of getting a few dollars from the public, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the public is refusing to believe in me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started pacing the floor again. I sprang up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop worrying, Ran," I said. "We'll make a trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our own to Alaska and see if we can find some trace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rocket--it is no easy matter to hide tons of steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that--and we'll get a detective to find McCargell</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get a written statement from him containing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth of the matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head dolefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A statement wouldn't do any good if he did make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it," he replied. "The public would be made to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we bought it from him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew he was right, but I refused to admit it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to search my mind for some hot counter-attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">to launch against our enemies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE never started the search for the missing rocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor did we put a detective on the trail of Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cargell, for something took place that afternoon which</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced Ran that there was no possibility of restor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his reputation before the public again. Since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">report of the rocket committee, we had secluded our-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">selves in the apartment, refusing to see any visitors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our meals were served there, and we also installed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">private television receiving outfit to prevent the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant experience of using the one in the hotel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting the public.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had just finished luncheon and were sitting about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room facing the television screen, while the events</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world occurred before us. Sensational testimony</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a murder trial in New Orleans had halted while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">court recessed, and we were about to change to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatrical wavelength and attend a musical show in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, when the bell announcing important news jangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">loudly. The scene shifted to the warden's office in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">federal penitentiary at Atlanta. A man in prison garb</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a scar across his right cheek was about to speak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something vaguely familiar about him stirred my curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity before he was introduced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warden informed us that the prisoner was Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fred Smith, serving a sentence for using the mails to</seg><seg type="columnLine">defraud, and had something of vital importance to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Morteshang affair. Before the prisoner had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken a dozen words, both Ran and I recognized him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the waiter who had served our farewell dinner in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miami hotel on the night of the rocket take-off. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he had hidden in the room off the balcony and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had overheard Ran tell me all the details of the proposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraud, including the parachute descent, the exploration</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip up the Amazon and all the rest. Smith explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">his previous silence by declaring frankly that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned to extort enough money from us on the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piration of his sentence to live comfortably for the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The ways things have turned out, the world will</seg><seg type="columnLine">know all about it before I am free, and my knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do me no good," he concluded. "I might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread the glad tidings now, while everybody is inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested and get what fun I can out of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We waited in vain for him to tell the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan--how we planned to disillusion the public and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn back the awards, but he said nothing about it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been too well coached for that, I know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ran stared at the screen with tragic eyes. Noama</seg><seg type="columnLine">put her arm about him and wept, while Vomi strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the room white with rage, cursing fluently in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">native tongue. I could only grit my teeth in anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ran accepted his defeat stoically, and no amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">urging on our part to fight back could change his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vomi, with the hotheaded impulse of youth, wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek out Hibbs and Hyman forthwith, and force the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth about their part in the conspiracy against Ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them. I must confess that I was with him heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soul in that proposal and yearned for nothing bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter than to choke either the truth or the life out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hyman with my bare hands. Ran would hear nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it; he would not even make a statement for the pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later in the afternoon the New York television an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncer informed us that the government, universities</seg><seg type="columnLine">and various scientific societies would probably file suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to force Prof. Morteshang to return the medals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">awards. Nothing developed along that line, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that night we mailed the medals and checks for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">FLIGHT TO VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">791</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">awards back to every society, college, city, organization</seg><seg type="columnLine">and individual that presented them, including Congress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ran and I spent most of the night at this, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loama, Vomi and their slave governess packed suitcases</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trunks. In the early morning hours we disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, leaving only a vacant apartment to greet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hordes of news men, camera men, television reporters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">attorneys and the rest that descended on it next morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and gave the world another thrill by announcing</seg><seg type="columnLine">our mysterious disappearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE story of Prof. Morteshang and his sensa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional trip to Venus ended there as far as the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">was concerned. He has never been seen in public</seg><seg type="columnLine">since, and I am here telling for the first time what</seg><seg type="columnLine">became of him and his three companions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We left the apartment secretly and shot up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevator to the roof on the one hundred and fiftieth</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, where we hired a large taxi-plane and flew south</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our recently purchased estate in the Ozark Moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains. It is really quite a pretentious place, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">located in a sparsely inhabited country, with its pala-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial house and spacious grounds all enclosed by a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall to insure secrecy. My mother and sister were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there at the time--they still are.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meadow behind the stables stood a nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed steel rocket, an enlarged duplicate of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one which made the historic trip to Venus and return.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The new rocket was the one in which the Morteshang</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific and diplomatic mission, Princess Loama,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prince Vomi, and their slave governess were to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">journeyed to Venus. We had given out no information</seg><seg type="columnLine">about its construction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the month that followed, while the world won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered what had become of us, the rocket was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted and filled with stores for a voyage. I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preparations with a heavy heart, for I knew it meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the final departure of my friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I couldn't stay on earth any longer, Les," Ran de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared. "I could never live down the opinion the pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic has of me. On Venus I will be an honored scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a personage high in court favor. Besides, I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">in duty bound to return Loama and Vomi to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was another reason, too. I had seen Ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Loama on the terrace in the moonlight with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">white arms about his neck and her lips against his.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would, indeed, be high in the Green Court, I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trifle wistfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come with us, Les," Ran pleaded, but I could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake my head. Heaven knows, I wanted to, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced the same thing here on earth that he was escap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from, but my mother needed my care. Loama</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleaded with me, too, her lack of words more than re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed by the eloquence of her eyes. Had things been</seg><seg type="columnLine">different, she--oh, well, I couldn't have gone, anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The final day came. I accompanied the little party</seg><seg type="columnLine">up into the body of the rocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'We have parachutes this trip, too," observed Ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a smile, indicating four bundles at our feet. "Shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">we make them five instead of four?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head. Final good-byes were said, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loama gave me the surprise of my life by suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing her arms about my neck and kissing me fare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. It was the only kiss she ever gave me. In mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ory I can still feel the moist warmth of her lips. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The elevator carried me down to the ground, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mother and sister and little group of mechanics</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited to demolish the elevator. We moved back a</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe distance. The door in the rocket above us closed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My watch registered exactly noon. Ran wanted no</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescopes to follow him out into space on this trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flame suddenly roared down from the firing cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, tearing up the sod and igniting the wood of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen elevator. The rocket shot upward, leaving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long trail of fire. Straight up it rose, diminishing rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly to a black speck and then to nothing. For a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I squinted up at the clear blue sky where it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sighed and glanced down at the ground. A flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yellow metal caught my eye.

It lies before me</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my desk as I write this, like the invitation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">goddesses of Venus to an earthbound adorer.

It is a small stream whose strangely red waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">flow into the Pacific. On my trip last year I had discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered that its waters were powerfully radioactive. Water</seg><seg type="columnLine">has the power of absorbing radium emanations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">emitting them in turn, and I hoped to find radium-bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing minerals in the bed of the upper river. Twenty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles above the mouth the river emerges from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cordilleras. There are a few miles of rapids and back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them the river plunges down a magnificent water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall. No exploring party had ever been back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls. I had hired an Indian guide and made a mule-</seg><seg type="columnLine">back journey to their foot. At once I saw the futility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of attempting to climb the precipitous escarpment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the water there was even more powerfully radio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">active than at the mouth. There was nothing to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">but return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This summer I bought a small monoplane. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was comparatively slow in speed and able to spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">only six hours aloft, its light weight and the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">area needed for landing, made it the only machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">suitable for use in so rough a country. The steamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">left me again on the dock at the little town of Vaca</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morena, with my stack of crates and gasoline tins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a visit to the Alcade I secured the use of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned shed for a hangar. I set about assembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane and in a fortnight I had completed the task.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a beautiful little machine, with a wing spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">of only twenty-five feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, one morning, I started the engine and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trial flight. It flew smoothly and in the afternoon I</seg><seg type="columnLine">refilled the tanks and set off for the Rio de la Sangre.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stream looked like a red snake crawling out to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea--there was something serpentine in its aspect. Fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing high, I followed it, above the falls and into a region</seg><seg type="columnLine">of towering mountain peaks. The river disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath a mountain. For a moment I thought of land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and then it occurred to me that it flowed subter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raneously for only a few miles, and would reappear</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther inland</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I soared over the cliffs and came over the crater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A great pool of green fire it was, fully ten miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">across to the black ramparts at the farther side. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the green was so smooth that at first I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it was a lake, and then I knew that it must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pool of heavy gas. In the glory of the evening sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow-capped summits about were brilliant argent</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowns, dyed with crimson, tinged with purple and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold, tinted with strange and incredibly beautiful hues.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amid this wild scenery, nature had placed her greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure.

As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> x the sun sank lower, a light silver mist gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the peaks, half veiling their wonders, and flowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the crater. It seemed drawn with a strange</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">attraction. And then the center of the green lake rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in a shining peak. It flowed up into a great hill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerald fire. Something was rising in the green--</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying it up! Then the vapor flowed back, revealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange object, still veiled faintly by the green and</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver clouds. It was a gigantic sphere of deep red,</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked with four huge oval spots of dull back. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface was smooth, metallic, and thickly studded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">great spikes that seemed of yellow fire. It was a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, inconceivably great in size. It spun slowly as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose, on a vertical axis, moving with a deliberate, pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poseful motion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It came up to my own level, paused and seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin faster. And the silver mist was drawn to the yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low points, condensing, curdling, until the whole globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a ball of lambent argent. For a moment it hung,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbelievably glorious in the light of the setting sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then it sank--ever faster--until it dropped like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plummet into the sea of green.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And with its fall a sinister darkness descended upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desolate wilderness of the peaks, and I was seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a fear that had been deadened by amazement, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that I had scant time to reach Vaca Morena</seg><seg type="columnLine">before complete darkness fell. Immediately I put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane about in the direction of the town. According</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my recollections, I had, at the time, no very definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of what it was I had seen, or whether the weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibition had been caused by human or natural agen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cies. I remember thinking that in such enormous quan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tities as undoubtedly the crater contained it, radium</seg><seg type="columnLine">might possess qualities unnoticed in small amounts, or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, that there might be present radioactive minerals</seg><seg type="columnLine">at present unknown. It occurred to me also that per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps some other scientists had already discovered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposits and that what I had witnessed had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial of an airship in which radium was utilized as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">propellent. I was considerably shaken, but not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmed. What happened later would have seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible to me then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then I noticed that a pale bluish luminosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gathering about the cowl of the cockpit, and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I saw that the whole machine, and even my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own person, was covered with it. It was somewhat like</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Elmo's Fire, except that it covered all surfaces in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">discriminately, instead of being restricted to sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">points. All at once I connected the phenomenon with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing I had seen. I felt no physical discomfort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the motor continued to run, but as the blue radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance continued to increase, I observed that my body</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt heavier, and that the machine was being drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward! My mind was flooded with wonder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror. I fought to retain sufficient self-possession to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly the ship. My arms were soon so heavy that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold them upon the controls only with difficulty, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt a slight dizziness, due, no doubt, to the blood's</seg><seg type="columnLine">being drawn from my head. When I recovered, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already almost upon the green. Somehow, my gravi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation had been increased and I was being drawn into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit! It was possible to keep the plane under con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol only by diving and keeping at a high speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I plunged into the green pool.

The wings of the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still distinctly discernible. Suddenly a smooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandy plain was murkily revealed below, and I was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to level the ship off enough for a safe landing. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came to a stop I saw that the sand was slightly lu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minous, as the green mist seemed to be, and red. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time I was confined to the ship by my own weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I noticed that the blue was slowly dissipating, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it, its effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As soon as I was able, I clambered over the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cockpit, carrying my canteen and automatic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were themselves immensely heavy. I was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to stand erect, but I crawled off over the coarse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining, red sand, stopping at frequent intervals to lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat and rest. I was in deathly fear of the force that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought me down. I was sure it had been directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by intelligence. The floor was so smooth and level that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I supposed it to be the bottom of an ancient lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sometimes I looked fearfully back, and when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a hundred yards away I saw a score of lights float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the green toward the airplane. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous murk each bright point was surrounded by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disc of paler blue. I made no movement, but lay and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched them. They floated to the plane and wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it with a slow, heavy motion. Closer and lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came until they reached the ground about it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist was so thick as to obscure the details of the scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I went to resume my flight, I found my ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess of gravity almost entirely gone, though I went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and knees for another hundred yards to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible observation. When I got to my feet, the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lost to view. I walked on for perhaps a quarter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile and suddenly realized that my sense of direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">was altogether gone. I was completely lost in a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, inhabited by beings whose nature and disposition</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not even guess! And then I realized that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the height of folly to walk about when any step</seg><seg type="columnLine">might precipitate me into a danger of which I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">know nothing. I had a peculiarly unpleasant feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of helpless fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The luminous red sand and the shining green of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air lay about in all directions, unbroken by a single solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">object. There was no life, no sound, no motion. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">air hung heavy and stagnant. The flat sand was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of a dead and desolate sea. I felt the panic</seg><seg type="columnLine">of utter isolation from humanity. The mist seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come closer; the strange evil in it seemed to grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">more alert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UDDENLY a darting light passed meteor-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the green above and in my alarm I ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few blundering steps. My foot struck a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">object that rang like metal. The sharpness of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion filled me with fear, but in an instant the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gone.

Somehow, a real</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eagle had been turned to metal! It seemed incredible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet here was the concrete proof. I wondered if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radium deposits, which I had already used to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much, might account for this too. I knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">science held transmutation of elements to be possible--</seg><seg type="columnLine">had even accomplished it in a limited way, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">radium itself was the product of the disintegration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ionium; and ionium that of uranium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was struck with fright for my own safety.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that some daylight filtered through the green,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for at dawn it grew paler, and even the red sand ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared less luminous. After eating a few more of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">berries, I ascertained the direction in which the stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant red water was moving, and set off down-stream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the west. In order to get an idea of where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going, I counted my paces. I had walked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">two and a half miles, along by the violet plants, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came to an abrupt cliff. It towered up until it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in the green gloom. It seemed to be mostly of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black pitchblende. The barrier seemed absolutely un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scalable. The red river plunged out of sight by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff in a racing whirlpool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I walked off north around the rim. I had no very</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite plan, except to try to find a way out over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs. If I failed in that, it would be time to hunt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane. I had a mortal fear of going near it, or of</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountering the strange lights I had seen floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. As I went I saw none of them. I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">they slept when it was day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I went on until it must have been noon, though my</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch had stopped. Occasionally I passed metal trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had fallen from above, and once, the metallic body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bear that had slipped off a path above, some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in past ages. And there were metal birds without num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber. They must have been accumulating through geo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical ages. All along up to this, the cliff had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpendicularly to the limit of my vision, but now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a wide ledge, with a sloping wall beyond it, dimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible above. But the sheer wall rose a full hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet to the shelf, and I cursed at my inability to sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mount it. For a time I stood there, devising imprac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical means for climbing it, driven almost to tears by</seg><seg type="columnLine">my impotence. I was ravenously hungry, and thirsty</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At last I went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In an hour I came upon it. A slender cylinder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black metal, that towered a hundred feet into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenish mist, and carried at the top, a great mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room-shaped orange flame. It was a strange thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fire was as big as a balloon, bright and steady. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked much like a great jet of combustible gas, burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it streamed from the cylinder. I stood petrified in</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement, wondering vaguely at the what and why</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then I saw more of them back of it, dimly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">scores of them--a whole forest of flames.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I crouched back against the cliff, while I considered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here I supposed, was the city of the lights. They were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping now, but still I had not the courage to enter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">According to my calculations I had gone about fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles. Then I must be, I thought, almost diametrically</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite the place where the crimson river flowed under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall, with half of the rim unexplored. If I wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to continue my journey, I must go around the city, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I may call it that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I left the wall. Soon it was lost to view. I tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep in view of the orange flames, but abruptly they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone in the mist. I walked more to the left, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came upon nothing but the wastes of red sand, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green murk above. On and on I wandered. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand and the air grew slowly brighter and I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night had fallen. The lights were soon passing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fro. I had seen lights the night before, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled high and fast. These, on the other hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed low, and I felt that they were searching .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew that they were hunting for me. I lay down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a little hollow in the sand. Vague, mist-veiled points</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light came near and passed. And then one stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly overhead. It descended and the circle of radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance grew about it. I knew that it was useless to run,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I could not have done so, for my terror. Down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down it came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">** A ND then I saw its form. The thing was of a glit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> l \ tering, blazing crystal. A great-six-sided, up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right prism of red, a dozen feet in length, it was, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a six-pointed structure like a snowflake about the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, deep blue, with pointed blue flanges running from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the points of the star to angles of the prism! Soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet fire flowed from the points. And on each face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the prism, above and below the star, was a purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone that must have been an eye. Strange pulsating</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights flickered in the crystal. It was alive with light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It fell straight toward me!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a terribly, utterly alien form of life. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not human, not animal--not even life as we know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it at all. And yet it had intelligence. But it was strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">and foreign and devoid of feeling. It is curious to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even then, as I lay beneath it, the thought came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, that the thing and its fellows must have crystallized</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the waters of the ancient sea dried out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater. Crystallizing salts take intricate forms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I drew my automatic and fired three times, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets ricocheted harmlessly off the polished facets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It dropped until the gleaming lower point of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prism was not a yard above me. Then the scarlet fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out caressingly--flowed over my body. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight grew less. I was lifted, held against the point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You may see its mark upon my chest. The thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated into the air, carrying me. Soon others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting about. I was overcome with nausea. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene grew black and I knew no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I awoke floating free in a brilliant orange light. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched no solid object. I writhed, kicked about--at</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothingness. I could not move or turn over, because I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get a hold on nothing. My memory of the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days seemed a nightmare. My clothing was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me. My canteen still hung, or rather floated, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulder. And my automatic was in my pocket. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the sensation that a great space of time had passed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE METAL MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">797</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a curious stiffness in my side. I examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and found a red scar. I believe those crystal things</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cut into me. And I found, with a horror you</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot understand, the mark upon my chest. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">it dawned upon me that I was floating, devoid of grav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity and free as an object in space, in the orange flame at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of one of the black cylinders. The crystals</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the secret of gravity. It was vital to them. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering about, I discerned, with infinite repulsion, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great flashing body, a few yards away. But its inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights were dead, so I knew that it was day, and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange beings were sleeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"TF I was ever to escape, this was the opportunity. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">JL kicked, clawed desperately at the air, all in vain. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not move an inch. If they had chained me, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have been more secure. I drew my automatic, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved on a desperate measure. They would not find me</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, alive. And as I had it in my hand, an idea came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my mind. I pointed the gun to the side, and fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">six rapid shots. And the recoil of each explosion sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">me drifting faster, rocket-wise, toward the edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shot out into the green. Had my gravity been</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly restored, I might have been killed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall, but I descended slowly, and felt a curious light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness for several minutes. And to my surprise, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I struck the ground, the airplane was right before me!</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had drawn it up by the base of the tower. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be intact. I started the engine with nervous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">haste, and sprang into the cockpit. As I started, an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other black tower loomed up abruptly before me, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">veered around it, and took off in safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a few moments I was above the green. I half</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected the gravitational wave to be turned on me</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, but higher and higher I rose unhindered until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accursed black walls were about me no longer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sun blazed high in the heavens.

A long line of Troglodyte airplanes was swoop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing towards us from the African coast. And from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">summit of the Rock, and from the Spanish mainland</seg><seg type="columnLine">came Europe's aerial navy to do battle with the foe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just in time, after all!" cried our captain.

"But</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time being you are at our service. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is the purport of your order from the Admiralty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yesterday? Well, that being so, you will stay here at</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own peril. If you fire one gun, or one is fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Rock, they will just smother us all in a sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of poison. Let us get into the Atlantic and steam for</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. We shall see a lot of the fight through our</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses. I'm sorry, but I must reach America. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever this battle goes, the world will be at their mercy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless I can perfect my method of fighting the Trogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their own weapons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a little hesitation, the captain bowed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitable, greatly against his own wishes, and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter disgust of all the officers and men. The Wildfire</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood out into the western ocean, her nose to the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every man who could be spared from actual duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on deck. It was a clear, calm day, and we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a splendid view of the first great battle in the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were at least three times as many Europeans</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Troglodytes, but against such strange foes as these</seg><seg type="columnLine">our airmen had to learn the rudiments of battle on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Trogs appeared to hesitate at first, never having</seg><seg type="columnLine">met such a display of resistance before, stopped, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time hovered motionless, consulting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Europeans rushed to the attack. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">near enough to see the bright flashes from the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, to hear the rattle of their discharges. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a greater flash, and the heavy booming roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great 100-ton gun on the Rock itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The all-fired fools!" shouted Hopkins, stamping</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down in sheer helpless rage. "They are just</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking the Trogs to annihilate the lot. They might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have let the Rock alone if the fools had kept quiet."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Close on his heated words came the second report</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gun, and the leading Trog vessel vanished in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a burst of flame. But before the crew of the Wildfire</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stopped cheering came the, to us familiar, "pop"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Troglodyte guns, and immediately afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cloud of smoky haze was seen to unfold upon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the famous fortress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One burst of shell-fire came from its batteries--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one. Then the sinking cloud of gas hid it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">view, penetrated the many galleries, and smote it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. The Rock had become a mausoleum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the sooner we get away from here, the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll be pleased," said our friend, grinding his teeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The neighbourhood isn't healthy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The issue of the battle was all too evident. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trog vessels, driven by their powerful radium engines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and able to rise and fall at will, were quickly masters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the situation. Their speed and activity baffled our</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunfire, and their fatal poison bombs shot forth in</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodigal profusion, enwrapped the Rock, the harbour</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, the shipping, and many of our slower air-craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a billowy cloud of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After vainly endeavouring to rise above the soaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD AT BAY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">801</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Trogs, to hit them on the move, or even to ram them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the European vessels were either driven off or lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the gas cloud. Their very method of attack, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass formation, was their chief undoing. In mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation they were caught in the cloud and, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their crews dead or dying, only escaped from it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash aimlessly to earth or sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is the Wildfire doing her best captain?" asked Rita.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can't you get a bit more speed out of her? We must</seg><seg type="columnLine">get home. The Trogs have beaten us, and the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Europe is open to them. A few hours' flight may</seg><seg type="columnLine">see them over London itself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Disastrous Home-Coming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">«TT TE are doing our very best, Miss Courtney,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">%/%/ was the captain's reply. "We are going all</seg><seg type="columnLine">* * out. I only hope some of those fiends won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be attracted by our smoke. Rotten smudgy stuff we</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up at Port Said. But they are sending us all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the help they can--submarines, cruisers and hydroplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriers will be on the lookout for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope they get to us in time," growled Hopkins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass to eye. "Some of the galoots are hiking it back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Africa, and one seems to be coming our way. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess they used up a fair dose of their poison--must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have liberated some cubic furlongs of the stuff--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">are going back for more. Yes, this chap is after us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If they would only drop a little lower, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon settle the matter," said the captain. "I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight to the last. The men are ready at the guns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one good shell will be enough. If it comes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worst, the steam pinnace is alongside, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must try to save yourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We had better get aboard then," said Rita decisively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the captain left us. "We might, in the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, be overlooked. They will have no idea of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance, fortunately."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Trog vessel was gaining fast upon the ship as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we climbed down the ladder and set our little craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">going. But as the enemy plane gained she rose steadily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had evidently learned that warships were really</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous foes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why this particular vessel should have followed us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except out of a sheer lust for slaughter, we shall, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, never know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had put nearly half a mile between ourselves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the destroyer when the duel began. A veritable tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent of metal from the Wildfire roared and screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sky, but fell short of the upward-leaping Trog</seg><seg type="columnLine">--or so we thought. Then came the first Trog bomb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gas-cloud quickly curled round the ship, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she drove clear of it. As she emerged, another bomb</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, and as she moved out of the second cloud, she met</seg><seg type="columnLine">a third. And now, though she still moved, her guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">were silent. The insidious poison had penetrated all</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ports, had entered all her ventilating ways. A ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dead, she still moved on, trailing the clinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud in her wake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, to our intense surprise, the Trog vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to fall. Slowly at first, then with increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, and under the impulse of her horizontal screws</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rising gale, in a slanting, downward swoop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's falling! She was hit after all!" cried I.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Glory be!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But she's heading this way, and looks like dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumb on us if we aren't quick!" shouted Hopkins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Crowd her along, Sonny!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The naval engineer crowded her along. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">race between our boat and the falling Troglodyte ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sel. Out of all that wide expanse of water the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gravity must bring them down upon us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We cleared ourselves from the impact of the hurtling</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane by about a couple of fathoms. As she struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water, we had a swift glimpse of her frantic, gro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tesque crew. They were grunting and screaming in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fright, climbing to the highest parts of the upper deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The impact broke the vessel to pieces, nearly all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, with their living freight, sank at once. But one</seg><seg type="columnLine">large section of the rear wing remained afloat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon this sprawled a Troglodyte. The floating wing</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted towards us, touched the pinnace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What happened, happened so quickly that it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably take me a longer time to write of it than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the event itself needed for its occurrence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pasty-faced creature, his dark goggles lost, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering at us through nearly closed eyes. In his trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling hands he clutched a flame pistol, trying to level</seg><seg type="columnLine">it upon our boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hopkins and I sprang forward together, but I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a shade the swifter. I seized Rita roughly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged her down to the bottom of the pinnace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was so near a thing that I felt the scorching heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flame upon my back, and a great hole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat's side was eaten away by the fierce atomic energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the discharge. A crack came from the engineer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver, a splash in the water threw spray over us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when we rose to our feet, there was no sign visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our enemies or the fragments of their craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The water was now lapping in at the hole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, which all our efforts failed to plug, and only by</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceaseless baling could we escape foundering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a backaching task, and very glad we all were</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, a couple of hours later, a naval hydroplane picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">us up. We reached Portsmouth at sunset. A special</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane rushed us to Croydon, and there we were met</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a vast crowd. We had scarcely set foot to ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">when my Head--the chief of the Daily Scoop--forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way to the front and seized me in both hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Had to come--got across on a submarine--simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to see you if only for a few minutes--you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're to stay here--our people have loaned you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What!" I shouted, wrathfully incredulous. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was true. We had been loaned! As though we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">national heirlooms! We were no longer free citizens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a mighty nation--we now belonged to the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">human race, and were easily the most important per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons in the world. And wherever lay the greater need,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there we must go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALTHOUGH our own country had by no means</seg><seg type="columnLine">. escaped unscathed, yet our hurt was as nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared to the damage that had been wrought upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the teeming myriads of Europe. There could be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">question but that it was policy to strike the first blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">802</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where the very concentration of the enemy would work</seg><seg type="columnLine">against them. Moreover, until by experiment I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfected my discovery and divulged the formula to</seg><seg type="columnLine">science, it was deemed much too risky to expose my</seg><seg type="columnLine">person to the perils of such a passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're famous, my boy," he continued. "Car</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting to rush you up to the Downing Street bunch--</seg><seg type="columnLine">special cabinet meeting, all the big-wigs there. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can only work this anti-gas stunt you've hinted at!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you look after the apparatus and papers in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms?" I interrupted. "I wirelessed from Wellington</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the stuff--you haven't let Edgar get them?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">queried anxiously. Edgar is my brother, &amp;nd a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">careless young cub I have yet to meet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He had them, Harding, but the Government rounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">up all your stuff to the last cigarette--got machinists</seg><seg type="columnLine">to duplicate the bits, and took photostats of the Mss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">in case of accident. I've got the originals with me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he assured me with much pride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good old U. S.!" I exclaimed thankfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had a long and wearying time at Downing Street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a number of military, naval, and air experts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I would rather not repeat the flattering things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were said, nor dwell on the details. A large cheque for</seg><seg type="columnLine">expenses, use of Government workshops, and the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">technical skill were placed at our disposal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thereafter ensued forty-eight hours of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense mental concentration and physical strain pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible for the human frame to endure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every minute of this period was passed in the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woolwich workshops. I had sole control of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">resource and every man in that immense area.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never once were my clothes removed; I slept in</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatches anywhere. I ate in snatches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And finally, it was accomplished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A machine for projecting the gas-dispersal rays was</seg><seg type="columnLine">built on the lines of my original drawings. It resembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short, squat, wire-wound gun, mounted on swivel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearings. I can't go into the technical exposition here;</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffice it to say that the current from the motor driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamo, fed into the coils of wire, produced an intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic field in the gun, from which the strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickering rays shot out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It looked more like one of the spark producers on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Trog vessel than I would have believed possible. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent out an intermittent stream of sparkling rays as</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as a current was passed through it. We could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, of course, as yet test it on the actual poison gas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I had little doubt of its efficiency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fagged as I was, I sought Rita.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You won't have long to wait for a test," she ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, as I concluded my report. "The Trogs have</seg><seg type="columnLine">established a camp within fifty miles of Paris and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack is believed to be imminent. The French Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, I have just learned, has asked ours to send you</seg><seg type="columnLine">across with your machine.

Four Troglodyte vessels were</seg><seg type="columnLine">already at work, firing poison bombs at such of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great forts round the city as had too recklessly betrayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their positions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our guns are splendid, and so are our airmen,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried one of our informants.

Would it dispel</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poisonous gas? Would it disperse that cloud?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Victory of Paris</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE fate of the whole civilized world hung in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balance.

The crackling flashes of ghostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance were dispelling, destroying the deadly cloud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I turned the gun about as though laying dust with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jet or spray, the masses of vapor thinned and van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished--thinned and disappeared even more rapidly, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderfully, than under the influence of the Troglo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dytes' own apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had won!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sudden relief, the realization of success and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD AT BAY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">803</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it would mean, was a joy too intense, too great, to bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Frenchmen laughed and wept; and in the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports of their delight, they hugged and kissed me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the beginning only, Max," said Rita, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering her sanity and dabbing her shining eyes.

They burst within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few feet of us, and I instantly turned the gun on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. A few seconds of the sparkling light and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incipient clouds were destroyed almost before they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun to be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our French friends had seized their opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">also, and from anti-air-craft guns mounted on armored</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars had opened fire on the Trogs. Both vessels were</seg><seg type="columnLine">riddled with shrapnel, and crashed to earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An urgent telephone call hurried us next to St. Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main, where the other two vessels had begun their fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. The same tactics again succeeded. I dispersed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gas; the ships came down to investigate; the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunners saw to the rest.

We can safely leave the gun down here</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the care of some of your handy men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't quite see what we can do if we go up, Hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing?" said the alert airman, "but if it's good enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you, it's good enough for me. I'll go up with you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jump in here, wait till I've wired to the Palace, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll start."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our chauffeur, experienced transport driver though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was, wiped the perspiration from his brow when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled up at our destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wouldn't do that run again for a fortune!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked out. "Only God knows how we did it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The balloon, already nearly inflated when the Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral's order arrived, was released, immediately we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into the basket. The earth fell from under us</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly. In a few moments we were hanging in</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptiness, London far below, rising quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two--three--four thousand feet," said the General,</seg><seg type="columnLine">consulting the barometer. "Still going up. The sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">is warming the gas, and there's scarcely a breath of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind. We shall soon be alongside the enemy--if only</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will condescend to wait for us. What's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">programme ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My idea, General, is to capture that vessel," I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing to the Troglodyte airplane hovering still above</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and now slowly moving about as though uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to do. "You be ready to throw out ballast when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I give the word, for we shall need to jump up soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jump quickly. I think I can do the rest. Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">your lead shield handy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up and up we went till we were almost on the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">level as the Trog. They fired a gas shell at us, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst into a grey cloud. A sack of ballast overboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we were above the danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How I envied the Trogs their ease and rapidity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement. They rose slightly, floating just above us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew slowly nearer in a spiral curve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hartopp and I had each got repeating rifles, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my signal we both fired together at a Trog who was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing a paralysis tube over to take aim at us. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a yell of pain he threw up his arms, and the deadly tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched overboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just at that moment a cloud passed slowly between</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and the sun. Came a chill breath of air, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that coolness, the gas in the envelope contracted enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to send us down two hundred feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only the prompt sacrifice of ballast and the return</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sunlight sent us up again in time to escape the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second gas cloud they tried to smother us in. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now we were above them, and our chance had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking back on our exploit now, I can see only</seg><seg type="columnLine">too clearly what a mad insane freak it was. Had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trogs been half as daring as we were, had they taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the measure of our powers, that day would have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of Max Harding and General Hartopp. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">very confidence must have scared our foes, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own confidence and curiosity proved their undoing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pull the valve cord, General, and drop us along-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side," I cried. "Poke your rifle over the basket-edge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drop the first beggar who makes a move. Now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Rita's Appeal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T seems incredible even to me, in retrospection, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stratagem succeeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As balloon and airplane came alongside, hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">level, our rifles spoke rapidly. The Trog who was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the control wheel, and another who was training his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame pistol upon us, collapsed with ludicrous urgency.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hartopp fired again and dropped a third.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They jumped up a hundred feet; we threw out more</seg><seg type="columnLine">ballast, and followed them. We were now not six feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surrender your ship, or we shall destroy you all!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Descend as we descend, give up your weapons when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you land, and your lives shall be spared. If you refuse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we shall follow you, and kill you all with our fire-guns!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At least, that's the purport of what I yelled at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trogs in the best I could manage of their language, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the most swaggeringly raucous voice I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">command.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It worked! They grunted and screamed aloud in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their surprise and fright at hearing their own tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a fortunate thing I knew enough to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">them understand," I said to Hartopp. "What a gor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geous bluff! They could get away from us any mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment if they weren't too scared! They're coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down! Drop us gently, side by side, and keep your</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle on them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right-oh!" said the imperturbable airman. "She's</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptying fine. We shall land on Hampstead Heath, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">this little breeze holds. Splendid, Mr. Harding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just on the edge of the Heath the Trog vessel came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth. A crowd that had gathered to watch our</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent ran to seize our trail rope; a squad of Royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Air Force men rushed to the spot. Then we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">afoot and quickly disarmed our seven Trog prisoners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were too surprised and dazed to offer resistance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the soldiers--to save them from the threatening</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob--pushed them into a motor lorry and drove off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For the time, at any rate, London was saved. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">806</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what was almost more important was the moral effect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of this second victory. Humanity took heart of cour-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">age once more. On sea, on land, and in the air, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was proved that the Trogs were not invincible, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that they could be fought and beaten; and all the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world, from that moment, set itself to work upon the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one supreme task of ridding its surface from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">destroyers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I skip over the rejoicings and ovations of that day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They were sufficiently embarrassing and upsetting to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a shy journalist without having to write about them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I come to the evening of the day after, when, in com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pany with several of the best engineers in the Air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Force, I was examining the captured Troglodyte vessel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A big marquee had been put up over it, electric light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wires run across to it, and a cordon of regulars kept</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">off the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The engineering details of the ship were a revelation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to us. In particular, the simple construction and tre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mendous power of the radium motor excited our ad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miration. The method of breaking up the radium and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">releasing its atomic force was very wasteful, we could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see; but what did that matter to the Trogs when they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had tons of the material only requiring to be mined?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was enough motive power aboard, we calcu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lated, for a five-thousand-mile non-stop flight. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were ten gas bombs, three nerve-paralyzing guns, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">four flame pistols.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With the help and advice of one of the Trog prison-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ers, who seemed more amenable to reason than his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">companions, our men quickly learned the use and con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trol of the various gadgets. Very carefully, but very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">successfully, we made a trial flight of an hour. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rose and fell vertically; got up a horizontal speed of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">200 miles per hour. We shot out a gas bomb---and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dissipated it with our own spark-ray; we paralyzed one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of our number--and brought him out of the helpless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">state; we learned that the atomic discharge of the flame</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pistols was so great that each pistol could only fire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">once and then was useless. It was a weapon which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">every Trog, on reaching maturity, was given to keep,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as a weapon to be used only in the last resort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When we had descended after our successful trip,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the vessel was being hauled into the shelter of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">big tent, somebody suddenly materialized out of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shadows at my side. Rita, tired-eyed, smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Crossed over and came up at once, Max. Did all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the work arranged. You are wonderful. Do you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know what this capture means to us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It means that we can fight them on equal terms now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--soar as they can soar. We can build a fleet of vessels</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such as this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Is that all! I just hate to spoil anything, but where</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are you going to get the radium from? You and I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know where there is plenty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Still harping on that mad idea, Rita," said I. "We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are going to beat the Trogs to their knees first, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one of our conditions of victory will be a supply of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1 radium from below. Another will be the release of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all our prisoners. The General Command is consider-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing all that at this very moment. Expecting news any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As a matter of fact," replied this amazing woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've just been advised of their decision. They see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case as I see it. They think we ought to try to seize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Outlet, hold it, and then make terms with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trogs. You and I, being the only persons who can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make ourselves understood by the enemy, must go</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. And that is what this splendid capture of yours</seg><seg type="columnLine">means, my dear, stupid Max. With this vessel, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can carry out the expedition."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And, incidentally, we risk the vessel and our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives? And with this vessel we can even descend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outlet, and make an effort to rescue--well, John Rixon</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rita gave me her hands and looked me straight in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Max," she said, in a low voice, "will you listen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me just this once? If we can save John Rixon from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that living death underground, we must do so. A great</seg><seg type="columnLine">man such as he must not be lost to the race. I know--</seg><seg type="columnLine">why shouldn't I admit it? --that you love me. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't speak yet. I know it, I can't help knowing it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm glad to know it. But I should be gladder still to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that you could rise above the jealousy that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mars ordinary folk; I want you to try to save him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You want me to try to save him for you--to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">up all hope of winning you for myself?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's your test, Max," she said. "I shall know then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you love me with the sort of higher love that every</seg><seg type="columnLine">true woman values in her inmost heart. I shall know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you are living up to the high standard I've set</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you. You will come willingly, you will help me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Back to the Underworld</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN Rita Courtney appealed to me like that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could there be any doubt about my response?</seg><seg type="columnLine">My hard mood broke up, giving way as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">log-jam suddenly "gives" on a Canadian river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will help you willingly, Rita; I will do anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make you happy. When do we start?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It sounds banal, antipathetic, but "high-falutin"</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroics were never in my line. I couldn't put into</seg><seg type="columnLine">words the feeling I had, that some psychic understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing had leapt from soul to soul, that in some mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">way Rita Courtney and I were nearer to each other in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment than we had ever been before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If the vessel can be got ready, we start in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. The General Command is very keen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She released my hands, gave a little sigh of relief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of content.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will see that it is ready," said I. "Our folks ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken all measurements and particulars of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airship and its engines, and they will be able to build</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fleet to pattern if required, if we can manage to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring back a supply of radium from down under. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am not quite happy about, Rita, is exactly what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are going to do when we reach the bottom of the Out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let--if we get that far."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm hoping that John will be expecting us," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">she. "You know that he and a few more prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">were trying to manufacture crystal radio sets, as there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were plenty of suitable minerals in the rocks, and lots</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wire. It is queer that the Trogs, for all their</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD AT BAY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">807</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical cleverness, never invented radio. Well, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Governments are now busy sending out powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-wave radio messages in Morse, on the chance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">John may pick them up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And we shall not go to the Outlet alone. We shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">be convoyed by a squadron of fast airplanes and fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by several big airships with supplies. We shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle in the great crater, and while we are descending</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shaft, the others will be able to deal with any Tro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glodyte vessel that may be returning to the Outlet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remember, they can know nothing of what we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing, and will be quite unprepared for our coup."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It sounded all right. Rita's heart was set upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking with us the Troglodyte prisoner, who seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">less scared, less hostile than his fellows, we began our</seg><seg type="columnLine">southward voyage next day. We had a great send-off</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Hendon, and having fitted a receiver aboard, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in touch with news all the way. The vessel was steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a rock, and proved wonderfully easy to control</seg><seg type="columnLine">once we had mastered its features. •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> News came in constantly, and everywhere humanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">was recovering from its panic and despair. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the Troglodytes were being met with resistance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being attacked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arsenals and workshops in nearly every country</seg><seg type="columnLine">were busy making "dispersers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The worst news came from South Africa. The *</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trogs had been more thoroughly vicious there, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">more wholesale way, than anywhere else. Their raids</seg><seg type="columnLine">had so disorganized the life of the community and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked on the superstitious fears of the natives, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been a great black uprising.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A new T'Chaka had arisen, and the dreaded Zulu</seg><seg type="columnLine">impis once again swept over the land in a torrent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughter. Coherent resistance there was none, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the holding of Johannesburg by the whites will rank in</seg><seg type="columnLine">history with the heroic defense of Lucknow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The railways were deserted and rapidly overgrown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The smoke of Kaffir kraals went up where once had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been white men's towns; the beasts of the wild came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back south of the Orange River. It was a melancholy</seg><seg type="columnLine">story--a glimpse of what might have happened in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northern Africa, in India, in the Southern States of</seg><seg type="columnLine">America, had no fortunate help come to the world, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not Rita and myself escaped in time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not modern to talk of Providence, of a Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolling Hand in our affairs," said Rita. "I once used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scoff at such ideas myself. But now I'm not so sure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I have a feeling which I can't get rid of, that there has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been more than coincidence in our adventures. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been guided, protected, spared--for a purpose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe that, too," said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We reached the devastated area, the vast, arid wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the green face of the Amazon forest, without mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hap. We descended vertically to the flat space used by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Trog vessels, and our ten convoy 'planes came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest on the best patches of ground they could find.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later, the three large airships arrived, carrying petrol</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other supplies. And then we came to the snag</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had discussed till we were tired of discussion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Trog vessel we had, of course, a "disperser,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which got its power from a radium charge. That we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have to take down with us, to protect us from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas attack either in the shaft or at the bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then what of our convoy left above? Their guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">would, no doubt, make short work of any Trogs com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing home unsuspectingly; but what would happen when</seg><seg type="columnLine">some more alert Trog captain heralded his approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gas bombs?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our only hope was in making the descent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft, rescuing our friends, and returning before dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aster happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All my doubts, objections, fears, came back to me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">full force as the helicopter, after hovering above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black centre of the crater, began its downward journey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Troglodyte prisoner assisting us eagerly--he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going home!--we let the vessel fall like a plummet into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness. Then, carefully, gradually, we brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lifting screws to work, checking our speed, and so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinding, roaring, we went down, down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was madness--sheer, stark madness. I was a fool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the authorities were fools. We had let ourselves be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnotized by a woman's fierce resolve to save her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lover. And I ? I loved her, and I was throwing my life</seg><seg type="columnLine">away--and her own life, too--to save my rival!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Into the Depths</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT last, we emerged from the long darkness, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the great opening at the foot of the shaft--</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the flickering phosphorescent light that lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange scenery of that strange world with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly glow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vessel grounded with a jarring shock, settling</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside another 'plane that appeared to be deserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, we had counted upon the unexpectedness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our descent for our immediate safety. The Trogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be aware of our coming, would think the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel was one of their own, manned by some of them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. The quiet, unmolested landing, however, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nevertheless uncanny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very few Trogs were in evidence, but a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people who were walking about--a couple of humans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unshaven, ragged, dirty, dejected-looking--suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed up to us as we stepped down to earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were shaking hands with John Rixon and Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have to pour it all out right away, Max," said Dick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a husky voice. "No time to be polite. Things haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">panned out so badly, but it's just touch and go with us</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then they didn't imprison you when we got away?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes, they did, and a rough time I had of it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">good old John got me out. He doctored the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panjandrum again, and the old chap was so pleased he</seg><seg type="columnLine">set me at liberty when John asked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we are fixed like this just now. We have left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prison camp down under--hopeless!--and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to hang round here. We try to get a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the new arrivals, warn them what to expect, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so on. But His Royal Nibs has got another touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "flu"--lots of the Troggies caught it on their voy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages and brought it down with them--and, from all we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear, he is in a vile temper.

He's about at the end. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hadn't come now, I'm afraid you would have come</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late to save him. I'm not feeling particularly fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, I can tell you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to greet John Rixon as he relinquished</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rita's hands. He had been holding them as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never let go. It was fortunate that Dick had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given me those words of warning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such an utter change in a man I have seldom seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet I ought not to have been surprised, knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work he had done and the deadly horror of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground world in which he had lived and toiled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The marvel was that he--or any of us--had kept sane</seg><seg type="columnLine">and preserved life and spirit at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face was pinched and drawn, his frame was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrunken, his hands were unsteady, there were streaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of grey in his dark hair. Only the eyes held their old</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, their old force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Glad you succeeded, glad you've come, Harding,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "Dick will have told you how we are fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. I never thought both of you would have taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">this terrible risk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you heard from us--you expected us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, after your message. We have got a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystal sets, of sorts, and a fellow who can read Morse</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a book. If only we could have sent you a reply!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would have stopped Rita coming down here again."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You wouldn't, John!" she cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's foolhardy work, Rita girl. Mad. Senseless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is very unlikely we shall get away unless we start</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon. You are surprised that I'm leaving the prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their fate? The job has got beyond me. It's awful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible, down there. All sorts of folks--mixed races</seg><seg type="columnLine">--black, yellows, browns. They are out of hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Won't listen to reason. Have to be driven to the mines</seg><seg type="columnLine">like slaves--or beasts. I can't bear to think of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things I've seen. There has been jealousy, suspicion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of the prisoners, seeing us going about freely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have accused us of being traitors, of being paid tools</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Trogs. They nearly killed Dick once, and I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been threatened often.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not coming away because of that. The position</seg><seg type="columnLine">is absolutely hopeless, and I'm not the man I was when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you went up.

The vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">will carry at least a score."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a dreadfully changed John Rixon who replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no time to be lost; it was impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get down to the prisoners' camp beyond the lake and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prison works; even if we got there we should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobbed, attacked. We must save ourselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Much as I had disliked the man, I found now that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had admired, respected him still more. It brought a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">queer, lumpy feeling into my throat to see him thus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And at the same time I felt that thus broken and</seg><seg type="columnLine">despairing, he was an even more formidable rival, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old resourceful courageous, dominant John.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rita would pity him, yearn over him. Even if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not loved him before, she would assuredly love him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. For not only are Love and Pity akin--they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">woven of the self-same mind-stuff. I saw the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope that I had begun to cherish anew, in spite of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense and reason, fading away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For knowledge of the catastrophe that happened in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next few moments we have to rely on General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hartopp's vigilance. Whilst we were absorbed in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting, he had turned to the wireless and, with ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phones on, was listening to news from above ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even the strange world into which we had come did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not divert him from his duty. He got the news "All</seg><seg type="columnLine">well," he told us afterwards, and then noticed our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Troglodyte prisoner making signs to a group of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Troglodytes in a distant part of the vast cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The prisoner went on to hammer on the metal frame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of the vessel--systematic, rhythmic tappings that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were quickly answered by a faint cadence of similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">noises all around us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Being sure that our prisoner was in some way be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traying us to his folk, Hartopp sprang upon him, closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, and bore him to the floor of the hold. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the tappings and the answering signals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed to his aid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the struggle, the Trog managed to secure the flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol carried by the General--we had all armed our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves with one of these weapons when we captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel in London--and immediately discharged its</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous atomic energy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the Troglodyte did not trouble to expend that</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy upon us. He aimed at the ship's engine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting propeller. When the blinding, searing flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light went out, a hole, a void, a nothingness was where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motive power and mechanism had been. The ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sel was now a useless, immovable hulk!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more we were captives of this underworld.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Crater Is a Sea of Gas</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OR a moment we were shocked into stupid inac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. All of us, that is, except Hartopp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He is a big man, with a strong Irish strain in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancestry, and tough and agile as the Trog was. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">airman got him down, pinned him to the deck. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand he held the creature by the throat; with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">service revolver gripped in the other hand, he nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished the job.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop! Don't!" cried Rita. "Hold him, but don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill him. We want him. He will be useful. Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was splendid of him to act like that! He is loyal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his race, to his people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Troglodyte could not understand her words, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, but he evidently grasped her meaning. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to struggle, and when Hartopp reluctantly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased him and allowed him to scramble to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shook himself like a dog just out of the water. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned to Rita with an expression of gratitude that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost comically pathetic. His pasty white face</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD AT BAY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">809</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was wrinkled in a most ludicrously ugly fashion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Love, Sacrifice, Justice, we had already found these</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the underworld. Now we could add to them Loyalty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Gratitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now the whole great cave was full of life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Troglodytes were running towards us from all direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, and the rock tappings sounded all around us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and several airplanes emerged roaring from the shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">owy corridors in the dim distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Roused a regular hornets' nest," said Dick. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">look like being well stung. I was afraid we couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away with it. What's our line ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand by the vessel, what's left of it," said Hartopp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuming command. "Luckily our radio set is still in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact. We are still in touch with our people up above</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the crater."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Troglodytes were now all around us, closing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us, an alarmed, a curious, an angry crowd. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">flourished their long metal rods, some of them threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened us with their precious flame pistols.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On our part, we held our own weapons and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame pistols we still possessed well in evidence,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We had better parley-voo a bit, or whatever you call</seg><seg type="columnLine">it down here," said General Hartopp. "Ye gods! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hole! What a nightmare crush of hobgoblins!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We expected a fierce attack every moment, but for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some reason or other the Trogs held back. They sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded us, they threatened us; that was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is strange that they did not try to paralyze us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their violet rays," murmured Rixon. I say "mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mured," for the force had gone out of the man's once</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong voice. "They could easily do it. It is a regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar occurrence down--down there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are afraid of the flame pistols we carry," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rita. "Also, I think they are afraid of our paralysis</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes. Luckily, they don't know the tubes were de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed along with the motors just now. Besides, John,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe the Trogs are waiting for the tall person, Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">so irreverently terms the Big Noise--otherwise the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Troglodyte chief. They are very puzzled about us, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">•--how we came to have their vessel, and why we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventured down here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I noticed that she had drawn John Rixon's arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">through her own, was soothing him by word and tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one would comfort a sickly child. Oh, I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool, a mad fool! What was I doing here? Why was</seg><seg type="columnLine">I not breathing the pure, free, sunlit air of the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, instead of waiting for certain death in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomy land of shadows?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' Rita went on: "I have not yet given up hope. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must make our prisoner talk to them--he will be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluent than either Max or myself. We must get him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell them how we are defeating them above ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how we have seized the top of the Outlet, and that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are ready to make terms."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The prisoner, prompted by us, got up and spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellows. He grunted, gesticulated, rolled his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung his arms. We could follow him well enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that he was telling them how numerous and des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate humanity was, how we had captured the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, how Rita had saved his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It didn't make any difference to the hostile crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They growled, grimaced and threatened us the more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet they shrank from action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They wait for Ul-Ulfa, the chief," said our pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner. "See--he comes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An air vessel emerged from one of the distant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy corridors into the great opening where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay. The tall, broad-browed, dignified Troglodyte who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed sentence on Ulf and Ulla, on Dick and my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, alighted from it and advanced towards us. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard of a dozen squat Troglodytes, armed with flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistols, came with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he approached, every Troglodyte bowed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground in reverence. As he passed them, they stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">up again, eager, angry, expectant, ready for instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ul-Ulfa spoke rapidly with our prisoner, so rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we could scarcely follow him, and our Trog replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same staccato fashion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With every nerve strung to highest tension--or so it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed till a few moments later--we listened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Hartopp, who had intermittently been switch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing our receiver on and off, clapped the headphones to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears suddenly. He broke in upon our silence with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smothered expletive. His face went pale, despite its</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruddy tan. He started speaking in quick, jerky sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A message from Bennett, top of the Outlet. At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked by fleet of returning Trog vessels. Lot of gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombs fired. Caught our chaps unawares--came at</seg><seg type="columnLine">great height. No chance. Bennett's aero last one un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched. He was making desperate efforts to get go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing before the poison cloud reached him. He told me:</seg><seg type="columnLine">'The crater is a sea of gas; it is closing round us; it^</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be a close shave. I think--' and there his mes- •</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage stopped."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A Royal Hostage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE knew too well what that message, that unfin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished message, meant. I could see as plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though I had been above ground, the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain of Troglodyte bombs from a clear sky; the unroll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the grey poison cloud as it sank into the crater,</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling up the vast cavity as water collects in a shallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool; the game and frantic efforts of our airmen, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late, to get their vessels going. I saw Bennett's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wireless operator sending us his message, speaking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the microphone up to the last moment, till the gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled over him, silencing him forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor was that the worst of it. The Trogs once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">were masters of the Outlet. If they dispersed the gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came down, we should be liable to attack from</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead. If they 'had any inkling of our expedition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might leave that sea of gas for a time, and return</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us would be impossible, even if we had a vessel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">working order. And that they would not guess our pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose in occupying the Outlet, that they would not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were at the foot of the shaft, was very un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely. We had come to rate their abilities rather higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fuller knowledge of their ways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid this is the end, really the end," said John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rixon.

"They may kill me, but they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">never take me to die down there in the mines you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen; His Nibs is talking to us!" cried Dick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tall Troglodyte stepped nearer, away from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, seemingly confident and unafraid. He began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak, and then--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sneezed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes--sneezed. Sneezed violently, uncontrollably.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly. Sneezed as though he were never going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop. The sort of sneeze that rasps your throat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes your sides ache. And he flourished a huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty pocket handkerchief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The only rag I had left--I gave it to him," ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained John Rixon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Into Rita's eyes came a sudden gleam of light. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen that gleam before, and I knew that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found some hope of escape, some chance, some possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility of rescue from our dilemma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you any quinine left, John?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rixon produced a small bottle from somewhere in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ragged coat.

"Much as they all kow-tow to His</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nibs, I fancy there are limits to their docility. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard some of them talking on the quiet.

"We are in a position where we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">take risks. I have a plan that may yet save us. Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief here, John, and hold him in conversation about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cold. All invalids like to talk about their ailments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sympathize with him. And whilst you are talking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, keep one ear open to what I'm telling the others."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rixon obeyed without a questioning word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must have been very persuasive, very convincing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Trog chief, his fit of sneezing over at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped up to the deck of the damaged airship fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly, and stood listening to our friend. Pleasurable</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief and angry annoyance struggled for mastery of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want you to see exactly what I'm driving at, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to act upon it at the first possible moment," said Rita,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking rapidly. "You have all heard of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quistadors, the Spanish conquerors of Mexico and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peru. They were a handful of men, fixed as we are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the midst of a big hostile population. What was</seg><seg type="columnLine">their first move?

They made the captive</seg><seg type="columnLine">kings give orders dictated by themselves, and the peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple obeyed. Now, we have Ul-Ulfa in our grasp. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">must seize him, keep him, and use him as a hostage for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own safety.

A fierce chorus of grunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">screams rose from the spectators, and the crowd rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nearest guard, recovering from his astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupefaction at the sight, sprang toward Hartopp. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">General loosed his left hand, found his service revolver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shot the Trog dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he pressed the revolver muzzle against the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the king, whom he now held at arm's length by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip on the collar of his rough tunic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The king didn't struggle at all. He seemed too aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, too dazed, too shaken out of his wits to make any</seg><seg type="columnLine">effective resistance. He was unarmed except for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame pistol, which Dick deftly removed from his girdle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell 'em what's what, you folks!" roared Hartopp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell 'em I'll blow his head off if they do a thing to us!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't hold him like this very long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rixon stood up, facing the infuriated throng.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Would they listen to him?

Of course, standing on the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air vessel and protected partly by its metal sides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had the advantage of position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Hartopp's dramatic pose was, no doubt, elo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent.

Then, turning and fac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his subjects, he spoke to them. He spoke quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke a long time. It was hard to follow him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we managed to learn that he told them he was in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands for the time being, and that they would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end, with many angry and threatening cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gestures at us, the crowd bowed to him and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">persed.

Can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand it. Ah! Hang it all--nothing but a blurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment the prosphorescent light that fitfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit the cavern was glowing at its brightest.

The Trogs make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their time measurements by it, and their 'day' is almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly the same as ours. You'll have to wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Waiting was just what we wanted least of all in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous state, but there was no help for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To pass the time, we practised our Troggese on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">king and the prisoner. They were as restless and wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried as ourselves. Ul-Ulfa, in particular, proved eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had heard much of the strange wonders of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer world from his own people as well as from John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rixon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, with a touching faith in the latter's heal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing powers, he had already swallowed the two tablets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammoniated quinine. He believed he would get better</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once, and his belief was no doubt a great factor in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his immediate recovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He desired to go out and see this strange, cold, daz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zling light upper world for himself, but the Council of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elders had refused to let him risk his royal person in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such dangerous regions. We gathered that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not object to going up with us if we guaranteed a safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">return. The chief fear he had was, that in his absence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Trogs might elect another king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We even got a few gleams of light on the history of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Troglodytes--gleams confirmed by bits of informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion picked up by Dick and John.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seems fairly certain that the dominant Trog race</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had met were the survivors of a long and bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">warfare between various races of the underworld. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a fierce struggle, waged without mercy. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">victors had compelled the beaten tribes to work the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly mines for them. The work had exterminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luckless slaves, the supply of criminals had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">short of their needs, and they had been driven to force</seg><seg type="columnLine">a way up to the earth's surface. They had always had</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of knowledge, some vague tradition, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence-of an upper world from which they had once</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Working back as well as we can from our scanty</seg><seg type="columnLine">data, we believe that this vast, honeycombed region was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid open to the air in the Permian Age, and probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonized by a sub-branch of the anthropoid ancestors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mankind in the Miocene. Then some convulsion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth's crust imprisoned them, and through long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages they learned to exist and adapt themselves to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange conditions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that's as far as we, plus all the learned scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world, have got in the history of the Trogs. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's as far as we ever shall get. We shall never know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Trogs brought us food and water, as agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon, for several days. On the fourth day a big crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them poured into the cavern, excited, angry, vo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciferous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two of the leaders pushed to the front and spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ul-Ulfa's white face went whiter still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Good News and Bad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T was an ultimatum that the Trogs had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">present to their king and to ourselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And no wonder the old boy is scared," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick.

And we are in it up to the neck, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do they say?" asked Hartopp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are tired of waiting," translated Rixon. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">have heard from the top of the Outlet by their tap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signals. As you have heard from our people, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio worked, there have been several attempts by our</seg><seg type="columnLine">folks to re-take the Outlet, but, lacking a 'disperser,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have all failed. The Trogs on top have decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay there and defend it, and no vessels have tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go up or down whilst we are here. You see, we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in rather a good position just here--in a dog-in-the-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manger-ish sort of way. Wtih our flame pistols we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make short work of any descending 'plane."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, what are they threatening to do about it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">persisted Hartopp. "We can't stop here forever."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Old Guard, the dyed-in-the-wool Troglodytes</seg><seg type="columnLine">who are not exactly in love with Ul-Ulfa, have given us</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days more in which to hand him over and surrender</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves. If we don't--well, they are going to wipe us</seg><seg type="columnLine">out--all of us, including the king himself. They will</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill the Outlet with gas from above, and this cave from</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. As our dispersing tube went in that bit of work</seg><seg type="columnLine">done by your prisoner, along with our engines, we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does the king say about it? For my part,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at their fishy faces, I believe they are just try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a big bluff," was Hartopp's reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid the Elders, at least, mean business,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Rita. "They have probably another aspirant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throne ready to step into Ul-Ulfa's shoes. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinks they will act--if we don't surrender."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yet he does not ask us to give him up--I ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mire the old boy for that," said John Rixon. "He sees</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we can't, for our own sake. So he is sending the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputation back and telling them we shall give them</seg><seg type="columnLine">our answer at the end of the time. There's really no</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope, either for him or for us. I am more than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry, Rita, that you came down here again on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish errand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dear old John! Don't worry about me. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">just got to face the worst together as best we can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to me, in my gloomy, despairing mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in the presence of danger these two were drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever nearer and nearer together. Certainly, in John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rixon's state of sickness of soul and body, he needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comforting, the petting, the companionship, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a woman could give.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ought not to have grudged him that little ameliora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the plight he shared with all of us; I am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that I did grudge it to him; and yet--and yet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two days passed all too quickly, and none too</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasantly. Though we were all companions in ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versity, I am sorry to say that our tempers were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they should have been. They were frayed. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped at each other when we were not sullenly silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or when we were not explaining how this, that, or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ought to have been done before the expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">was undertaken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Human nature, I suppose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We gave our Trog prisoner his freedom, as we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no further need of him, but he preferred to stop and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait upon his king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a loyalist to the backbone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At such intervals as we could get our set to function</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly, we heard fragmentary news from the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fight against the Trogs was being waged every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where with enthusiasm, if with fluctuating success. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy had been driven out of Europe, their camp in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Atlas had been destroyed. They had left Australia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but were masters of nearly all South America. Hop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kins had been busy in the States, and with the "dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perser" guns he had helped them to build, the U. S.</seg><seg type="columnLine">airmen had chased the Trogs south of Panama.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last we heard of Hopkins was that he was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an air squadron operating in Venezuela.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two days' grace passed off uneventfully, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the one frustrated attack made upon us by a band</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the more dissatisfied Trogs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They crept up to us during a minimum of the flick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering light, dodging from shadow to shadow. Each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them carried a paralysis tube, and their hope was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch us unawares and reduce us to helplessness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was General Hartopp's turn to be on guard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he admits that he was almost asleep when a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustling, dragging sound near the vessel roused him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity. His quick revolver shots woke us all, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">we found the lead shields we had brought proved their</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth. But for their shelter, their impermeability by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curious, nerve-numbing violet light, our days would</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed have been numbered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shields protected us, the attack failed, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trogs drew off sullenly, taking their dead and wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Let me say here that we never had any inkling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the Troglodytes did with their dead. Whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">they cremated them, or buried them in the deep mines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or desiccated them in chambers filled with poison gas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we never discovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we came to the end of our term of grace. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still a couple of hours before the actual time limit, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great cave and its approaches were already filling</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with a concourse of armed and excited Trogs. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us, it was evident that there were two factions</seg><seg type="columnLine">amongst them--one led by the Elders, who cared more</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the race than for the mere person of the king; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other formed of the common herd, who blindly wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipped their sovereign.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the king-worshippers, I'm thankful to see, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bigger lot," said Dick.

The way of escape is</seg><seg type="columnLine">open to us now that there is no danger at the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outlet. What is there to prevent us seizing another</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trog vessel--this empty one alongside for choice--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">going up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Miss Courtney, you've said it!" cried Hartopp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We've been down in this inferno till our brains--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 'em but yours--have gone mouldy! Of course we</seg><seg type="columnLine">go up, and the quicker the better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was John Rixon's turn to voice objections, to raise</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulties. John Rixon, once the man of iron will, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">initiative, of action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We have to take the king with us, remember. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to rely on the loyalty of his people to save us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have to find out whether the vessel we seize is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">working order, if it has enough fuel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We shall find all those things out when we get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work--and not before," said Rita, impatiently. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall find nothing out if we just sit here and talk. Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">we all agreed ? Are we all ready ? There's no time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste, and it may be a matter of getting away by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin of our teeth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was! I sometimes dream of that struggle, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantic grasp of the one chance in a thousand that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">took, and, when I wake from that dream, I find myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed in perspiration and gasping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We seized our weapons, our lead shields, and as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our personal luggage as we could carry, and jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from our damaged craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This was, perhaps, the most dangerous moment, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the assembling Trogs had caught us in the open, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">end would have been sure. But they were quite unpre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared for our move, and before they had recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their surprise, we had all gained our new quarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">--or nearly all of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Hartopp, shepherding the king, urging him along at</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver point, went first. Dick and I followed. John</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Rita brought up the rear, with our Trog prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">following. We told him he need not come, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was an outcry, a rush of angry Trogs, a scuf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fle, blows, some shots. We who had gained the shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air-vessel's deck, turned to see Rita in the grasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two squat creatures. John shot one through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, and, as he fell, Rita wrenched herself free, got</seg><seg type="columnLine">out her flame pistol, and wiped the other out of ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">istence. She grasped our outstretched hands and jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">for safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the tail of my eye I saw another Trog</seg><seg type="columnLine">levelling his flame pistol. John Rixon saw him at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same moment. We both sprang forward and pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rita in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We should have been too late had not another seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the danger and acted more promptly than we had done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Troglodyte prisoner leaped upon her attacker</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the swiftness of a tiger's leap. As he leaped, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurt of searing white radiance rushed from the pistol.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cave was lit by the ghastly glare of the atomic dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge, and when what seemed like darkness followed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our prisoner had ceased to be, had been burned to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent nothingness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rita had saved his life when Hartopp would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made an end of him; he had paid the debt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Even Self-Sacrifice had we found in that grim under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. Even there, in that night land of horror, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spark Divine that is in all things, was working upwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A scene of pandemonium followed. The party led</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Elders, uttering grunts of stern command, tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach us, to surround us. They used their flame pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tols recklessly, and in the fierce glares of radiance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbed the semi-gloom, many a common Trog looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his last on the flickering light of his native land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the common herd were too numerous, too fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natically loyal, and surged around us in a packed, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tective mass. The flame pistols, deadly as they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had one fatal defect--once discharged, they were use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less until they could be filled again, which was a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dangerous process. With all the knowledge we</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained from our brief contact with the Troglodyte</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, we did not learn that secret of releasing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic energy in a lump of quartz crystal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Whilst this conflict raged, we were busy inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-vessel. There was certainly some radio-fuel in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine, for it started up at once on closing the switches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but how much we had, how long it would keep going,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had no idea. It was not wise to probe too much be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the lead sheathing that housed the burning sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few trial spurts showed that the lifting screws</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in order. We raised the vessel from the floor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung in mid-air, throbbing, shaking. The Trogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered under and around, grunting, jabbering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ul-Ulfa stood at the side of the deck and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on them. He seemed to make a sudden resolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, raised his hand and spoke. Nearly every unit in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd bowed in reverence. As well as I can re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member, this was what he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "People, I go to the upper world, to see it for myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It may be that the people of the upper air are too strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us. If that be so, I will make peace with them, lest</seg><seg type="columnLine">they destroy us all. Let there be no more war between</seg><seg type="columnLine">us till I return."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An answering roar, a babel of cries, of which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make no sense, broke out. Hartopp pressed all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the switches down and the vessel leaped up into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness of the great shaft. Our one anxiety now was</seg><seg type="columnLine">814</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the power would carry us to the top or not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hopkins Tells His Story</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STEADILY, slowly, with roaring propellers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinding mechanism, the vessel bore us upwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the eerie blackness, upwards through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, long shaft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Once the power failed, or a cog slipped, and we sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with a sickening lurch, clutching at each other in</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly fear; then the vessel began to rise again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept on until we reached the top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Once more we breathed the fresh air of heaven, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more we saw the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Hartopp maneuvered for position before alight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing alongside the wrecked vessel on which several peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple were clustered, waving their arms and cheering, we,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had so wonderfully escaped from a living death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked long into each other's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh, my friend," cried Rita, tears running down her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face--tears of joy, of relief--"forgive me!

Introductions over, our expla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations were quickly made. It was no wonder the of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficer lifted his neat eyebrows in amazement--our story</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded miraculous, unreal, even to ourselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Still, it happened to be true, and there we were, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was our prisoner, the King of all the Trogs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">; Hopkins was bubbling over with enthusiasm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure at meeting us again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Say, folk," he cried, wringing our hands vigorously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"it's bully to see you!

Yes, it's a Trog vessel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">same pattern as yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I guessed it was, or you wouldn't have been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear the Outlet," said John Rixon. "You managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring a wireless outfit as well, I see. Expecting help ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any minute.

It doesn't seem long, but we've done a powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of hustling in the time. The whole American nation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir, got to work on those plans of yours, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">making gas-dispersing guns in a dozen places at once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning 'em out ready for use in less than forty-eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We tackled the Trogs first time outside the ruins</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Chicago--some ruins, Lord!--where there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big camp of them.

But our men separated--I had told 'em the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesson of Gibraltar, you bet--and, as fast as their gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells burst, we dispersed the stuff. Then a few of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">anti-aircrafts got to work and winged two of the hostile</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds. One of our chaps rammed a third, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth we riddled with machine-gun fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This rattled 'em some, I expect, and the whole covey</seg><seg type="columnLine">started up.

It would have done you good to see the hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scurry. But it was no sort of vise. We were above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and they couldn't outfly us.

Where now a few slave-peons</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratch a precarious living from a bare land, thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Indians fared well on the produce of their irrigated</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil, their terraced hills.

It appeared that they had come safely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">down the shaft and taken the Trogs completely by sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. Evidently some member of the party had a keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose for details and a retentive mind, for they seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know their way about. Read up all our adventures</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully I expect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They flew across the great cavity and along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage leading to the underground sea.

"Nothing, that is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except hope for the making of a Peace Treaty.

The terrible roar of the explosive jarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">every atom of the air, shook every plate and bolt on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our vessel, tortured our ear-drums into a silence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exquisite pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the camp and the air-ships, of General Hartopp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his garrison, not a trace was left amongst the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking area of desolation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the dust cloud smothered us, fast as we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising, and the sun glowed dimly red through the hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gritty swirls of pungent vapor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another few minutes and we should be out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this," I said, choking and coughing.

This ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion, which has destroyed the Outlet shaft and sealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up in their gloomy world for ever, means that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elders have triumphed over the king. In their fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage against us, they have preferred to be forever cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off from the upper air. For they will never make</seg><seg type="columnLine">another sally; of that I'm convinced."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And they know it would be hopeless, for we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be ready for them and could fight them on equal terms,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Dick. "But can't we ever get down?

Not all our scientific skill</seg><seg type="columnLine">could bore a shaft one tenth of that distance down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No; we have seen the last of the Troglodytes, the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their world. In my opinion, long before they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared sufficient radio-energy to cut out the shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, they will have perished. The prisoners will soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">be used up, the disease germs that have been carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">down there will spread rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It sounds archaic to suggest it now, but I really</seg><seg type="columnLine">and truly believe that the Troglodytes will die because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their wrongdoing.

Now, what about ourselves?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The wireless seems to function after a fashion,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Dick. "It was fortunate we installed a set on</seg><seg type="columnLine">every captured vessel. I hope they come for us soon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm tired of South America; Home for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, we were picked up the next day by an air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liner, and turned our faces homewards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If we had been important, notorious, lionized before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were now painfully popular. As journalists, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to have been having the time of our lives, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">our experiences had shaken us all, and there is such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing as having a surfeit of success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The General Council dealt most handsomely with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in the matter of my invention.

Had I not had sufficient warning?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Should I not have been better occupied writing the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our adventures or experimenting in my workshop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than sitting in the Green Park like a moon-struck loon ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We are not yet so far removed from the primal</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts from whom we have inherited our clumsy bodies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ape and tiger are strong in us yet. Convention,</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit, the sense of futility, kept me sitting there in-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">active, but in the heart of me I raged with a fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion; in my thoughts I murdered John Rixon over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somebody spoke my name, and John Rixon stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me. In some way he had changed within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, and yet his face was calm, impassive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've a message for you, Harding," he said. "Rita</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishes to see you at once; she insists on seeing you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know that I will go," said I, sullenly. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can tell me yourself, can't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John Rixon hesitated, opened his mouth, shut it</seg><seg type="columnLine">again with a snap.

"I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">get down to the office, and by the way, an apple pie</seg><seg type="columnLine">for dinner tonight would be greatly appreciated! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't had any for a long time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you like my apple pies, John ?" I asked smiling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do I? You are an expert at it. I suppose," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added as he all but disappeared through the crack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door as it stood slightly ajar, "the infinite number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of times that you have baked apple pies in previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">cycles of existence has made you adept in that line!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door closed and he was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dear John! Of course he understood the theory as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as I did, but he was forced out among associates in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the business world and it was essential that his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">be continually occupied with the practical affairs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. Dreamers might be vouchsafed glimpses of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth, but did such visions always prove beneficial?</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no doubting that John was a greater success</seg><seg type="columnLine">in life than I, whether he grasped the significance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain cosmic truths or not!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After all," I mused, "the difference between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great and the small, the infinite and the finite, right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrong, good and evil, is sometimes one of degree</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not of quality. The most difficult is simple if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we follow the rules. The people, who make a muddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their lives, have deliberately, though unknowingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen the harder way. They are law-breakers, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessarily in our legal sense, but they are transgres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sors of Universal Law. Had they simply worked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmony with the Law, success would hav&amp; come</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have not always worked in harmony with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Law," I thought. "None of us have.

Was Henley right or wrong when he wrote,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'I am the master of my fate, the captain of my soul' ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I believed in the cycle theory of time, and yet in it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	saw no hope for changing the errors of the past.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My theory was a death-blow to progress and evolution!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I HAD just slipped my last pie into the oven and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced casually out of the kitchen window when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I spied my neighbor, Mrs. Maxwell, on her cinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">path between her house and the garage. Suddenly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the same sensation that I had experienced at break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, "This has happened before. I know it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, like a flash, before a seeming darkness obliter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated my fleeting memory, came the warning to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness that Mrs. Maxwell ought not to enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">her garage. I took a step toward the door with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention of calling to Mrs. Maxwell. There was plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time; the path was long and she was not a third of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way to the garage. I watched her, my heart thump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wildly. She had stopped to pick up a scrap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper. I took another step toward the door, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, what's the use," I argued, "she'd think I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy to run out there and attempt to keep her from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her errand to her garage. I wonder why I have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">two sensations of this memory enigma today! Often</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are weeks, even months, apart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Resolutely I turned and left the kitchen, intending</seg><seg type="columnLine">to finish my remaining housework. I reached the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing of the stairs when the sound of an explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rocked the house to its foundation, caused me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start in wild-eyed terror. In a panic of fearful pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monition I rushed to a south window. The Maxwell</seg><seg type="columnLine">garage was a mass of roaring flames!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is fate, fate," I groaned in my anguish. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no hope! We mortals cannot escape.

Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizing that my present mental state must not con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue, I plunged into domestic and social duties with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vim that was most unusual for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not once during many months following the Maxwell</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy had I experienced a single recurrence of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaccountable memory flashes.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am only a tunnel and mine-worker, and I've written</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the things as I've seen them, therefore kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">excuse my English as well as grammar, as I am aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that neither is perfect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                   I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">P on a certain job, they were putting a tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel through &amp; granite mountain. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big job and they were working day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. They had cut through a vein of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, a vein of onyx and a vein of silver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The silver especially was particularly beautiful, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the spreading-out, branched form of an immense tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However the lead was not followed: for the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a power tunnel, designed to hold water; and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">time was a big factor, and the expense of the project</seg><seg type="columnLine">was colossal, such by-plays as silver mines were unim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant. Besides, it was the expert opinion that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver tree in the tunnel was a mere pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they did strike something in that mountain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no by-play. It was neither gold nor diamonds:</seg><seg type="columnLine">though in the opinion of a certain professor it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">more remarkable find than either. And it halted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel advance for three shifts, day and night. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">then was the find: a find which made tunnel No. 10 in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bald Mountain so celebrated?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Let us review the affair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As I have remarked, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked two shifts, a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a night one. This left</seg><seg type="columnLine">an interval between, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifts were eight hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">each. This interval was</seg><seg type="columnLine">split into two parts for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose, one part being al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lotted to each shift. Drill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as they did during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">working hours, and putting in the charges just before</seg><seg type="columnLine">quitting time, it was customary for the shift boss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the retiring shift to set off all the explosions he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged, immediately after work. This left a period</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the air to clear before another shift came on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course it was necessary to keep an accurate count</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the shots heard; otherwise the next shift going in</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in danger of their lives. That's why the shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">was allotted to the shift bosses. Even with such pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautions, it was not always possible to be certain of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tabulation; for in spite of efforts to prevent it, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots sometimes came at the same time. A very loud</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blast was occasionally put down as two shots; but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mere guess work. And when lives depended on it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the worst of judgment to come to such a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are persons of the opinion, however, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion which wrecked tunnel No. 10 was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to an unexploded shot. How else then do they</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain it? They claim there was some kind of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive in the chamber which was revealed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, let us observe the shift working at the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the explosion and see what we may see. This par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular night, Dan Parker was the shift boss. Daley</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the day gang had reported all O.K. So Parker and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crew rode into the tunnel with no apprehension</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This fellow, Parker, was a red-faced man, jovial,</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffy and fat. He wheezed continually, as if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the asthma. Claimed he got it from being gassed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the World War. He was a good shift boss, tolerant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resourceful and good-natured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This night there was a fellow, named Reno Bob,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one of the miners. They worked three miners with</seg><seg type="columnLine">each shift, each miner having a helper. Then too</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a crowd of muckers; fellows who shoveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the mud, dirt and rock into the miniature train which</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled out the debris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reno was not a regular night-shi ft man; he belong-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to Daley's gang. But a rock had fallen on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the miners, and the management wishing to lose no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and expecting a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">man every minute, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted Bob over to Park-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er's crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This Reno Bob was built</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Hercules. He had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, saturnine face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">coal black eyes; a very devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a handsome fellow. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not especially pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear he was put on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night shift, for he had been in the habit of taking Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parker, Dan's wife, to the movies down at the pavilion</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the evening, and this change would cut him out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such diversion. However, this was not unknown to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dan. Reno was a welcome visitor to the Parker home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he worked days or nights, being a great friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the night shift boss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Parker was a very pretty woman with a flood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yellow hair, and fascinating green eyes. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have ever thought her likeness was behind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin stone wall which Parker and Reno Bob faced when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came on shift that fatal night.

So had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the miners. They had to have. There was water in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel. No river of water, but great drops which</seg><seg type="columnLine">oozed languidly out. And the floor was as slippery</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the devil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night crew jumped from the cars--not care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly but with one hand on the side; otherwise he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">liable to be on his seat in the mud, sprawled out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly damp to the skin. For the place was usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">sopping wet. It was a humid, stifling place to work in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of a ventilating fan, which theoretically cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the foul air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the muckers began shoveling; not briskly and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if their lives depended on it, but with the measured ease</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men accustomed to the shovel, and also to mines;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stroke about half between that of a Harp* and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican. Still they had Mexicans working here too;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they were not like the ones I refer to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the miners set their jack-hammers and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding into solid rock. Ever see a jack-hammer?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, it's like a long drill, much larger of course, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a dentist uses. It's worked the same; both of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">use electricity. But the jack-hammer gets his from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a longer distance. Still I don't know. Maybe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power the dentist uses comes from the same mountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The muckers had cleared away most of the fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter. And the jack-hammers had drilled one or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two holes already. It seems Dan Parker had stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Reno to ask him about the show down at the pavil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion. He says so himself. And it's reasonable. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't Reno tells it. Reno's gone flooey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parker says he had just shouted in Reno's ear about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the show; heard Reno reply something about Love's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reward--that was the show, you see--and had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away, when the blast came. It must have been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  *An Irishman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Reno's jack-hammer; for he's the only one went flooey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides any other man who had drilled into dynamite</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have known it. Shocks like that ain't forgotten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, the blast caught them all. There was a mess,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tell you, in that tunnel. I wasn't there myself but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard Jonny Tinker tell what he saw. Jonny said</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was worse'n a plane-bomb in the World War. Jonny</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in that war, so he ought to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, there was that blast. The train driver, Mat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you recall, who was just running a string of loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars out, caught the sound at the tunnel's mouth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had an inkling of what it meant. He shifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">string; caught up a bunch of empties, took on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchman and raced into the tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he had to stop before he came to the place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was some kind of an odor neither of them ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelt before. This odor made the air almost impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to breathe. They had to come out again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time there was a crowd of men about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance. You see they never shot their blasts off</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night. It was always morning, when the night crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">came off shift. So anyone who heard the blast on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that particular night knew something unusual had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing that Mat and the watchman were stopped by</seg><seg type="columnLine">foul air, the emergency apparatus was brought out;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and several of the men being rigged up, Mat forever</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost his chance to see the result of the explosion; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie Bates took his place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, the lights were put out of commission by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this shock; weren't usually though, which only goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show it was no ordinary blast. So they had to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">in torches; you know the kind! They call them car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bide ; fill them with a white powder and run in water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they light a little hole where the gas comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. They're not bad lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they got up to the wreckage, they found only</seg><seg type="columnLine">debris and darkness. Flashing their torches toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall they were cutting through, they saw a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">jagged hole exposed by the blast, going into a cavity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, although this surprised them, they were not there</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explore cavities; they were there to save lives. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got to work looking for the missing men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One by one they pulled them out. Four of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dead and one man was permanently locoed. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Reno. I guess anybody would have been locoed</seg><seg type="columnLine">who ran into a similar bit of shaking up. I know I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't want to. The rest of the night crew were</seg><seg type="columnLine">O.K. They were unconscious for a time but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came around nicely. Harry Getz says he dreamed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chasing ostriches down in South Africa. If he did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll bet he never caught any of them, for Harry is too</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow even to catch a cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, they knocked off work for the day; let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air in for the tunnel to ooze off its poisonous fumes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Next night they went in again. Not the regular crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember. Men ain't no fools. Most of the regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew who were capable of moving on their legs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hill by this time. You'd be surprised the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few dead men will change the working crew of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine. But it does.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parker still was along however. When a man's mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEFORE THE ICE AGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">829,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ried, he can't just go and jump his job because of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected explosion. The job of supporting a family</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a more serious affair often than even T.N.T. blasts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And you know they're some blasts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY came to the ragged hole. They poked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their torches. Finally Parker, who was a brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, being as he was in the World War, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cavern and explored. He came back and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was white.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For God's sake!" said he to Dick Combs. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in here and see if you see what I see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the cavern in which Parker and Combs found</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves was a heap of skeletons, clustered near a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar, wonderfully-embossed, little bronze box, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lid of which had been broken open, probably by the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion; this lid had a tiny hole, the mouth of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">octopus head, with which it was adorned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cavern curved away from the line toward which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel was being driven; so that work was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">temporarily halted because of the find. But at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other end, along a walk of leopard-spotted agate, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a figure in mosaic, which held them spell-bound. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of heroic size; and seemed to represent a woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head on an immense snail's shell; the woman's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were large rubies and her head-dress, somewhat like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Grecian statues of their goddesses, was a helmet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up of innumerable flakes of moonstone. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's face seemed remarkably life-like; colored as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was with some shining enamel, which seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">match the glow of health.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick Combs said it was enough to startle one; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head standing out as it did away from the wall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming so real. But what was the explanation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skeletons ? No one could guess. It seemed a mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery beyond the knowledge of simple miners and those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who know even less than miners; the weak-headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">muckers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parker and Combs returned; and work was resumed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, work was immediately halted when Dan went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mouth of the tunnel and telephoned headquar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters. That's where they showed good sense. How'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">they know but it might be something of great impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance. Old Addington, the sup., certainly deserved</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit for stopping work till some of those university</seg><seg type="columnLine">guys had a peep. Remember, this was in a solid moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain; and heaven knows how long it might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Eddy came down. He seemed like a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable man to us people, whose only glimpse of edu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation is the Schoolmarm up at No. 2 and the Parson</seg><seg type="columnLine">at No. 7. He could talk about eocene and pleocene till</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had us all woosy. I've studied a few of the 'cenes</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, being interested in geology; but I never had</seg><seg type="columnLine">any pleosaurius or broncosaurus eating out of my hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that guy had. He knew everything that was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be known and some which wasn't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, he went up to the hole in the tunnel wall; gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look at the snail-lady and gasped. Even his expert</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of such things failed to classify her. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was flabbergasted. He was nonplussed. He was abso-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely speechless, something queer in a professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sent for a crony of his back at the big school</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they both taught; and there never before was</seg><seg type="columnLine">such English used as these two delvers-in-the-ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">used when they looked in the place exposed by Reno's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Eddy explained the pile of skeletons in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old cavern in front of the snail-lady, as persons</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrificed to her. Then Professor Monk took a peep</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the little bronze box, and allowed his colleague had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot of dope. He said: "The box is in ancient Aramaic;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the inscription thereon says that it contains a vola-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tile poison which shall guard the inner chamber ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">from profanation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Eddy says: "How does it come we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">here ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This of course was a poser for the man who read</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aramaic; but some of the boys came to the fellow's</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistance and told of the terrible smell immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the explosion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That explains it perfectly," contended Monk. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a protection against vandals only till an explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred. It was a very delicate apparatus; probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">an invention which has never since appeared on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. And the blast broke the small-quantity libera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the gases and made the poisonous odor which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was remarked just after the catastrophe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must say Monk reasoned much better than his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name sounded. Then the two savants went back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the snail-lady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you make out of it ?" asked Eddy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It represents Patience," was the reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That fellow Monk was always good at replies. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have accumulated a lot of sense with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, Professor Eddy didn't quite like the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terpretation of his colleague. "Your mistake is natu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ral," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't acknowledge I have made one--yet," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied the redoubtable Monk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I will show you," remarked Professor Eddy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your solution is merely a superficial observation. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you study the hybrid's form closely you will find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snail shell is not a snail shell, but the shell of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nautilus. Now the nautilus from earliest times has</seg><seg type="columnLine">symbolized a rising spiritually. This figure faces a</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-chamber; because the woman's head on the nau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilus shell symbolizes resurrection. Am I right, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear Professor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DOCTOR MONK admitted that should excavation</seg><seg type="columnLine">disclose another chamber behind, Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddy's theory might be the correct one. "What is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your, theory for the reason such a high spot was</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected for the tomb?" asked he then, with the look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man who has propounded a poser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "High spots were the sacred ones," answered Eddy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the learned, easily, and as if he had instantaneously</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doctor Monk shook his head. "Do you know why</seg><seg type="columnLine">this place is where it is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not if my theory does not suffice."</seg><seg type="columnLine">830</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is where it is because of a catastrophe. It was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is the mountain, of a much lower elevation--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may even have been only a hill--but some incompre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensible power lifted it to its present eminence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is your proof?" asked the other doubtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This!" And Professor Monk exhibited a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled shell in the palm of his hand, which he called</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whelk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where'd you get this ?" asked Doctor Eddy. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what does it signify?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I got it on the mountainside, half a mile down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug it out of a lime bed. And it signifies that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where it came from was at one time under</seg><seg type="columnLine">water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how do you know that wasn't before this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place was used as a sepulchre?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because," answered Professor Monk, "the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronze box there refers to this sacred tomb guarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the volatile poison, as an island."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't doubt you,' remarked Doctor Eddy, "but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish I read Aramaic also."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That wish is only natural; but surely you don't in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest way question my reading, my dear pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not at all. Your reading is eminently reassuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. But to the public, you must remember, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">savants' reading would be conclusive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">III.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHOVELS and picks were brought up: and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain number of laborers supplied to the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">professors. I had been assigned to them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first, that's why I can relate so much of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation. They interested me and they were worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole figure of the snail-lady was carefully re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved from the wall, so that it could be reconstructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a museum. And it was found to be only a veneer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">put up in flakes on a suitably chiseled out place in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid rock. All of the pieces were said by the profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sors to be semi-precious stones. Of course to the aver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age mine-worker this meant nothing at all. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most experienced were merely familiar with quartz,</seg><seg type="columnLine">granite, limestone and the variotis ores. While the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muckers knew nothing, some of them disputed things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted as true for the last half dozen centuries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the door, or what they believed was the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was found to be in the shape of a truncated pyramid:</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's what Professor Monk called it. And Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddy gave it as his opinion that it could not be bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered in, because the inside was smaller than the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Dick Grebs, who was a miner, temporarily loaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the university guys, was for drilling a hole and put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting in a light charge of dynamite; but both the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors vetoed this move. No telling what's inside, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, instead of a shot being fired, a hole was drilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean through the door. Do you know that door was</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot thick? Well, it was. We measured it. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hole was drilled, a stick was gotten the same size</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the hole. Pete Miller went out and got it. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were near the west entrance here, an entrance drilled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for air, and Pete says he had to climb a tree to get it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they made little holes at the end of the stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put in little springs which would be compressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fit the hole but which would spring out as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got on the other side of the door and so give us</seg><seg type="columnLine">a leverage. It worked all right. Five of the boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed the door easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air inside nearly blew out our lamps. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wait an hour before we could enter. I didn't care.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You see, I got paid just the same. Our time went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. We weren't hired by the profs. We were merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaned to them. Well, we hung around the West En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance (it was no entrance at all, as I told you, but an</seg><seg type="columnLine">air shaft) all that time and then, Professor Eddy test-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the air, said it was O.K. So we trails in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a sight in that room almost made my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart stand still with wonder. A lamp, in the shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an icicle, with a beautiful blue globe, hung from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling; and it gave a brilliant and weirdly-penetrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first thing which struck us as strange was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of a man; a big-muscled fellow, a fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">even larger and more powerful than Reno Bob, stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the north at a niche in the wall. We couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake this: for there were lights back of the fellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that he shone vividly before us. He was a real</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He held toward us menacingly a black tube of</seg><seg type="columnLine">five barrels, which had a curious arrangement at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other end, as if it might be some kind of a gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now everybody saw this: all the boys and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">professors. We just looked at the fellow and gasped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one would do who came on a live man in a tomb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next moment we looked and the fellow was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We went over to the wall and looked at the niche and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was none there. Instead there was a plate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what seemed like frosted glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now did you ever hear anything like that? A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing life-like before you to disappear while you</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked! Professor Monk cried to the Doctor: "Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you notice his classification? He is pre-glacial!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What gave you such conclusion?" asked the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His robe. It was made of mammoth hair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But was it a man?" demanded Eddy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It may only be some kind of a projection: some</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of throwing up on an apparently blank sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face some image of something. Maybe we stepped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">something which caused the thing to appear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we had to trail out again and practise over our</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance to the place. No use. We couldn't tramp</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly right, it seemed. We never saw the pre-glacial</seg><seg type="columnLine">man again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But say! You ought to have seen that wall. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up of an infinite number of squares, so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof was neither round nor square, but a kind of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">compromise between. And on the walls! There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pithons and dinosaurs in wondrous color, together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gorgeous butterflies, much larger than any now</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, and a funny bird which Doctor Eddy an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced as a "near relative of the pterodactyl." It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite a funny looking bird. (Only the pterodactyl</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a bird but a flying saurian reptile.--Editor.)</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEFORE THE ICE AGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">831</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, our attention being attracted to a great golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">lizard--he must have been the god of all lizards, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was colored like it--had fire in his mouth, a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden head, flakes of blue, scarlet and orange on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, which seemed outlined on what appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a row of shells around the whole room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PROFESSOR MONK looked at an inscription;</seg><seg type="columnLine">took down what seemed like a piece of cardboard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we all looked. It was light and you couldn't see</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it: and it seemed like some kind of a chart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, in red outlines, on a dull gray surface, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">some maps of something. But I never saw such maps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There isn't anything on the earth's surface now like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those maps showed. They were awfully funny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Professor Monk gave an exclamation as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of life were discovered. Then he cried: "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">land surface of terra firnia before the last Glacial</seg><seg type="columnLine">Epoch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But somebody trod on something which nearly gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">us heart failure. Out of the floor of the room, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful springs, arose two caskets. Pete Miller was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowled clean over by one of them. But nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. It was too solemn a sight. In each of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caskets, which were supported on golden-onyx pedes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tals of carved mammoths, lying in repose, not a hue</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from in life, in elaborate costumes, were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures. The one on the right was that of a woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strange to relate, too, it had a similar appearance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dan Parker's wife. Now don't get me wrong: there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing at all to this likeness, save what some fools</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to give it. There were people who weren't friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Dan or to Reno, who would like to infer that Reno</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't just what he should have been, because some</seg><seg type="columnLine">idiot noticed that one of the figures resembled the lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Parker home. But I, who saw the caskets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">say they don't know what they're talking about. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only a distant likeness. The woman lying in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">room had a long-drawn face--dolichocephalic, I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professors called it--and her eyes were wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully formed, even when closed--like an angel's, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whereas the man was dark and ferocious looking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a moustache somewhat like the Norsemen; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body was encased in what looked like silver mail;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not in plates, rather it was like fine chain, closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">woven together. On his head was a gold crown of</seg><seg type="columnLine">filigree gold-work; the thing being a continuous circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heads of the mammoth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman had on a dress of such fine texture that</seg><seg type="columnLine">her body could be seen through it. It looked as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">made from spider's silk. Maybe in the period when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she lived, they paid more attention to spiders and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed them to a greater degree than any living</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiders these days. Her feet were clad in moccasins of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattlesnake skin. While the tiara--I thought it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crown, but the Professors called it a tiara--was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold filigree work, representing a circlet of butterflies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">large sapphires being the wings, and making them blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">butterflies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this was not all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were ten little gold boxes, arranged in a circle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">around the room; standing on pedestals of white mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble, the slabs, under the little gold boxes, differing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">being semi-precious stones like sagenite, jade, moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, sardonyx, bloodstone and stones even the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessors could not recognize.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What these boxes were nobody knew. They had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little peep-hole and a glass somewhat like a lens in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, while behind was another glass piece which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">frosted. But there was only darkness when one looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in these boxes. The professors puzzled their heads in</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain, but could not make out what these boxes were.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was plain they were something important; or they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have been arranged with such care, or been</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, adorning, as it were, a king and queen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Eddy stood at the casket of the queen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">studying the lace collar she wore, an exquisite thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made almost of thistle-down, it seemed, when he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little cry of surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" asked Doctor Monk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The secret of the boxes 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On the floor here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Monk looked and saw a number of golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">squares arranged in a mosaic, around a central dove.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't see the secret," he confessed. "Explain it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other pointed to the floor and said: "Notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dove is in the shape of a turn-button."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What of that?" demanded Doctor Monk, incom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehensively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turn it," suggested the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Monk did so. There was the instant shining of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light seen in the little gold boxes. Each of us, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professors as well as the workmen, selected a box</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked in. In that tiny box, in each of them, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, was an inner eight-sided wheel, each side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which contained a picture, which the front lens made</seg><seg type="columnLine">real, of some grand scene of the recumbent monarch's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reign. Now don't get the idea it was like present-day</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving pictures. It was far more natural. It was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">made that not only were the scenes in their exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors, but there was also some arrangement by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which the figures seemed to stand out like in real</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, instead of being flat like moving pictures are.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here they had some knowledge which the present-day</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving picture industry would have given thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dollars to obtain; and they had it maybe ten thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand years ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT the thing which excited Professor Monk most</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fantastic bronze-colored box set on a shelf</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the feet of the caskets. It had in it little plates of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some light material; the surface of the plates contain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing little squares, maybe half an inch each and a quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch apart. Twelve of these plates had a ring through</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners at top and bottom; uniting the plates. Monk</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at these through a magnifying glass and uttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">an exclamation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" asked his friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The history of the world ten thousand years ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You don't mean it!" cried Eddy, his face filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy.

He lingered on the dock, undecided what</seg><seg type="columnLine">next to do. The next ship, he had been informed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ticket agent, would not leave until the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">week. And to attempt to connect with the boat by</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane was hazardous in this fog. He sighed resignedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes, there were no two ways about it; he might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back to New York and begin anew.

With a single slip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as had occurred now, on any one of the many</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, the whole schedule, on which one had spent months</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparing, was balled up into a snarl that called for</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroic measures to hold it, or eventually would force</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was about to leave the dock when a tall, well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed stranger accosted him with: "I understand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir, from your conversation with the clerk, that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have missed your boat?

It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mono-railroad!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A deep-toned bell clanged, a guard walked the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the long platform warning the crowd to keep back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pipe railing which ran parallel to the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooring, but fifteen feet back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the distance echoed a long, drawn-out whistle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shortly there shot into view the train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         Nally then saw why the</seg><seg type="columnLine">■ guard had warned them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay back. Projecting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sides of the stream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined cars, whose general</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlines recalled to his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures of great passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes, were gondola-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosures carrying electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors that drove the eight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot air-screws or propel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lers.

"No, they don't jump off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they FLY off when we hit a snowdrift. Seriously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is about the safest form of high-speed transport</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet devised, including the plane. During the two years</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have been operating we have had but few accidents</seg><seg type="columnLine">--all caused by snow drifting across the rail.

He glanced at the meter which now quivered</seg><seg type="columnLine">at 79 miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sometimes the express trains, three or four cars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rip over the rail at 150 coming down from the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, but the average doesn't go above 110 on the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretches."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nally was dazed, to say the least. One hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty miles an hour! A commerce carrier, three times</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as fast as the fastest crack trains! And a monorail at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that!

He was seated by an attentive waiter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He never forgot that dinner. The luxuriously dec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orated and panelled car might have been the private</seg><seg type="columnLine">salon of some hotel instead of the dining car of a mono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail train rushing at ninety miles an hour over the snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted valleys of British Columbia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he left the diner, Nally came upon the conductor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and halted him with the question as to whether passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers were allowed to inspect the "engine." Receiving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nod of affirmation, Nally hurried forward, for he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been waiting impatiently all afternoon to see the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">car of this wonder train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stepping into the "engine," expecting to find it</seg><seg type="columnLine">crammed with all sorts of interweaving pipes and tubes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he experienced a tinge of disappointment. Two huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanically neat, softly drumming gasoline motors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coupled to a large generator partly sunken into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. That reminded him of the gyroscopes. Nowhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he seen a trace of them. Those massive wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">undoubtedly were set below the floors of the car and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hence were of immense weight, as they were corre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spondingly small in comparison with the cars. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were more than two to each car? If that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, the generator must produce an unusually heavy cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent to take care of all the gyroscope motors and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">many driving motors. An unusual amount.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of the messy levers and valves, customarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">in use, there was a slate switchboard illuminated by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single shaded light. In the dim radiance cast by this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nally made out the form of the motorman in a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable seat forward. Before the motorman was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small board, no larger than the average radio panel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">set with numerous toggle switches. The train was</seg><seg type="columnLine">operated by what is known as "remote control/' No-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy, sticking levers or handles to twist or turn7~Bim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply a light finger touch would bring into action a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicated system of timers and starting rheostats, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">another touch would reverse the pitch of the screws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing the train to a quick, cushioned stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NALLY became conscious of a shrilling whistle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to come from outside the car and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to locate it until he suddenly recalled the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed at which the train was traveling. He stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer to the window, glancing at the calm, square-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jawed motorman whose eyes never strayed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering ribbon of steel that rolled in, outlined in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams of the twin headlights. The lights flashing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trestlework, giving it an unearthly, fragile appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance and tinting the trees with a silver fringe that stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">out abrupt from the surrounding darkness, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">beckon the train to greater speeds. Yet almost two</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of that ribbon were covered every minute!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rested his elbows on the wide ledge, watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black blurs that were distant trees flee backwards, noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reflection of the wan moon on the frozen rivers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams, and mused on the great change this road was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound to make in the beautiful snow-bound countries</seg><seg type="columnLine">MONORAIL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">835</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the north. A green light appeared in the distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew larger, and was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clear track.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another light, a white one this time, grew from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinpoint so rapidly that Nally knew it to be a train com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the opposite direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here comes the Meteor, the fastest mail express on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road," announced the motorman. "She's hitting it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up pretty on the level. I'll bet there isn't a plane in</seg><seg type="columnLine">these parts that can show their tails to her when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A minute later a streak of whitened windows showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an instant on the opposite track. A trailing blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an air whistle marked its passing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL the next day the monotrain hummed deeper into</seg><seg type="columnLine">. the snow-banked regions. After a pause at Daw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son to exchange crews and refuel, the train left at</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven--exactly fifteen hours after leaving Mono City.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the city behind, a raging snowstorm was encoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered as the train began to climb the mountains. Here-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tofore, the run had been on an almost level track, wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in and out of the mountains, detouring them. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now the contour was more rugged, passes were infre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent; so the track twisted and curled up the eleva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions and ran in an almost sheer drop down the oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site sides. At times the other rail would curve away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would not reappear for fifteen or twenty miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After following the Yukon River to Circle, the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the divide between the Yukon and the Kuskok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wim Rivers. Almost an hour of steady climbing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the train hurtled over the summit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The snow whirled and eddied about the cars as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">dipped down. The shrill of the air grew intense; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedometer crept up---90, 100; stood a bit at 120; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached its peak at 135! Still not a trace of vibration</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be felt, so well laid was that single rail. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed decreased to normal, for the divide was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">far behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the hours flew by and the train dashed across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wastes, Nally began to see the advantages of the mono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail system over all other means of transportation. Ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vated on a single thin ribbon of steel, propelled by air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">screws which know no icy, slippery track, the "mono"</seg><seg type="columnLine">had every and all the advantages of the modern steam</seg><seg type="columnLine">or electric "two-rail" railroad plus the speed of the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane. Although the blizzard howled and tore, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow, small stinging particles from the mountain tops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made sight of objects fifty feet away impossible, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"mono" shot over the rail at daring speed. What mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered a head wind when forty racing screws thundered</seg><seg type="columnLine">their defiance? The motorman knew the section and</seg><seg type="columnLine">relied upon his safety devices and signal lights, spaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">every eighth mile, to warn him of danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nushagak was reached at seven in the evening, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the train with a new crew took up the last leg of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">3,300 mile trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Restless, for the trip was becoming monotonous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nally wandered through the train glancing at the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers. The coaches were almost empty. Very few,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except those on business, made the trip to Nome or be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond in mid-winter. By far, the greater number of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">these were natives, prospectors and traders. Here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a man or woman whose dress and actions</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it evident that this was their first trip north. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forward coach Nally came upon a group of roughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed men, fur caps pulled down over their faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding them, presumably asleep. One regarded Nally</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfavorably through blinking eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nally passed on through the narrow communicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">door to the "engine" and sought his former position at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dazzling beams of the headlights apparently dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared at a point fifty feet from the car. From that</seg><seg type="columnLine">point a glowing radiance swept back--a grayish radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, cut and streaked by blinding, white-hot meteors</seg><seg type="columnLine">that came shooting in from the regions beyond that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached by the lights. The interior of the "engine"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dimly illuminated by the reflections. Below, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail rolled in under the train--straight and true as a taut</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire. The screws thundered and whined as the chang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blasts of the blizzard tore and pulled at the cars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they, thanks to those spinning gyroscopes, were as</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid and unyielding as the mountains themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning to the motorman, Nally commented, "Bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You bet. Nothing to worry about, though. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll into Nome on time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, what if something should happen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What, for instance?" queried the motorman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--broken rail," hazarded Nally, knowing this</seg><seg type="columnLine">accident could cause a terrible wreck should the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit an open spot at the pace it was then going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Broken rail? See that green colored plate on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"toggle board"? When a red light flashes in its place</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of things may have happened. A tree may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have fallen on the rail, a bowlder may have demolished</seg><seg type="columnLine">a part of the trestle, or the cold may have snapped or</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprung a switch. If this train is on the section in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble lies, an automatic trip-arrangement throws</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the power within the train. Immediately the emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gency brakes are applied and we come to a stop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What I can't puzzle out," continued Nally after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause, "is how you could keep upright after the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">is off. These cars look so top-heavy that it is a wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">they don't fall over when we go 'round a curve."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If all the power was off, the gyroscopes would keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">us upright for almost an hour. In that time, if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not get going again, that is, if we had motor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">generator trouble, we'd drop supporting bars to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trestle transverse members and we would be held up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right that way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The conductor out of Mono City mentioned run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning off the rail when hitting snow drifts. Is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">true?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a way, yes," agreed the motorman. "The sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veyors, when laying out the roadway, took into account</seg><seg type="columnLine">those places where the snow drifted high and so made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trestle-work higher to clear. But, you know, man</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't guess all of Nature's tricks. And so it happens</seg><seg type="columnLine">that once in a while we come upon a drift that is higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the rail and, if we see it in time, all is well. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, we just dig straight through, tunneling into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drift until the 'mono' stops."</seg><seg type="columnLine">836</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NALLY listened to the shrilling wind and hoped no</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifts lay ahead that night. At least, not while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in the "engine." "By the way," he continued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"how is it that this road hasn't been made known to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. I never knew it existed until a day ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I couldn't say for sure. From what I've heard, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is an experimental road built by a large American firm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If this system works out, they expect to cover the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">American continent with a vast monorail system. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess it's to cut down opposition and hard feelings that</seg><seg type="columnLine">news of it is kept quiet. Even so, I guess a great many</seg><seg type="columnLine">people know that we're doing a paying business up here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauling a tremendous amount of freight that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinarily go to the boats."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boy!" ejaculated Nally, "that would be great!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Think of going from New York to Chicago in nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours! Goodbye to the old forty-five mile an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">'chuggers.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a movement to their rear and as Nally</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to see what caused it, a new voice broke in:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Reach for the roof and be quick about it, if you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live to see those monorail trains. Up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The motorman glanced back and his face showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise as he threw off the power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four men in the rough garb of the northland stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering them with automatics. Nally recognized them</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the fellows he had noticed in the forward coach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently some sort of a train robbery was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">staged. Alaska was the last frontier and a few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jesse James' descendants roamed her mountain fast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses and plains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nally submitted to the rough handling of the bandits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who quickly had him bound and tied to a stanchion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the large switchboard. The motorman was tied about</seg><seg type="columnLine">six feet away from him. Meanwhile the fellow who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was apparently the leader studied the starting mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ism and, when the rope benders had completed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">job, the four left the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What in the world do those fellows want?" de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded Nally, after making several fruitless attempts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to loosen his bonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing--Why! Yes, there is! We have about</seg><seg type="columnLine">$9,000 in gold aboard that we picked up at Dawson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These fellows must have gotten wind of the shipment,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured the motorman. "I'm wondering what they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">do after they find the gold."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a few minutes the bandit chief returned. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned as he inspected Nally's and the motorman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds. Then he busied himself about the switchboard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding copper cable about the fuse blocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, what are you doing there?" demanded the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torman, realization of what was to follow dawning</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Want to know?" he laughed, throwing the coil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable to the floor. "Yes? With you two tied to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, the door locked, and the safety fuses shunted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is going to prevent this train from piling at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twenty Mile Hill? What if the bridge were blown</seg><seg type="columnLine">out? How does that hit you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, you crazy loon, don't you know what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are about to do ?" cried Nally, seeing the man was seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is my little joke!" laughed the bandit. "Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of hitting that open bridge at 120 miles an hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some mess when this car plunges on the rocks below!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eh, what ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?" shouted the motorman, beside him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self with anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's telling tales that will not concern you within</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour," retorted the robber, turning on his heel. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forward end of the car he took a ball of twine from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket and tying one end on the starting toggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch, he backed out of the car, laying the cord care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully on the floor. He ran the string under the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed and locked it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'll be a d-- fool," exploded the motorman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That rascal is the trickiest fellow I've ever seen.

Look!

The train</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in motion without a hand at the controls!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beside the trestle some ten men watched the slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">start of the monorail train with crazy grins contorting</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait until they reach the bridge," suggested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader, "they'll be sorry for having automatic control."</seg><seg type="columnLine">A loud roar of amusement came from the men. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">red and green tail-lights faded into the swirling snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The monorail train speeded up while the thud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motors and the whine of the generator grew louder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How far is that bridge?" queried Nally, a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry feeling settling in his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thirty miles or so.

An idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some new hold-up technique flashed through his mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be dispelled by the self-evident solid, middle-class</seg><seg type="columnLine">respectability of his visitor. Just then a particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicious gust of wind almost blew the door from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinges, dashing a cloud of rain into their faces. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">requirements of ordinary courtesy asserted themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You had better step inside," Forbes advised.

What could it be? Who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressed it to him and then buried it several feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground ? A thought struck him. Perhaps it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a practical joke played by some of the college football</seg><seg type="columnLine">team, with most of whom the agreeably mannered sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">retary was on good terms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If that were the game, they should not have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction of having their emissary witness the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">summation of their pleasantry--not if he could help</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. He gave the man some cock and bull story which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was accepted without comment, thanked him for de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">livering the thing and, slipping him something a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more substantial than thanks, got rid of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as he had gone, Forbes tried to unscrew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap, but could not budge it, although he exerted all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his strength. He was about to resort to a hammer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chisel (although what use a chisel would have been on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a substance like glass, that was as tough as India rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, is difficult to imagine) when the happy expedient</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trying it left-handed occurred to him. To his sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise, the cap came of? without any trouble. Inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a quantity of closely written manuscript. The idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a joke grew stronger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha! Ha!" he laughed, jesting with himself. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">manuscript found in a bottle, eh?

It was the writing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vanished scientist, Professor Jason T.

The writing was on some</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of white substance, the nature of which he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not determine. It was like paper, but thinner, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate. The ink, too, was different from any ink</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which he was familiar. It was a beautiful shade</seg><seg type="columnLine">of faint purple that seemed to glitter and gleam with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some interior luster. For some unaccountable reason,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forbes thought of his pet cat. Glancing down, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw old Archibald, as he called the creature, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him with an intent stare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paying no further attention to Archibald, who made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of dignified noises and disappeared, he rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly skimmed through portions of the manuscript and</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt his eyeballs literally starting from their sockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">with stark, unadulterated wonder. Sinking into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most convenient chair, he automatically lighted his pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and read, and read, and read.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never before, since the world began, had anyone come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">across such a tale as lay before his wondering eyes!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What the world would say, he knew not.

Of doubters he would ask two questions: First,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where zvas Professor Livermore? Second, of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">substances were the bottle and manuscript composed?</seg><seg type="columnLine">When these were answered, perhaps he would be skep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical.

While</seg><seg type="columnLine">the child undoubtedly did and does exist, it is impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to point to any particular moment and say, 'Now!</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is the time the child exists!'

He did have a hazy notion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what Livermore meant, though.

This gives us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">interesting material for conjecture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  How do we know that in every atom of our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">body there is a miniature world, or rather universe,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stars revolving around a central sun? Living</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beings may exist on these electrons whirling about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in our thumb nail. Time was when an atom was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">supposed to be the smallest conceivable thing, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the word atom means not capable of being divided</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or "uncuttable." Then came electrons which are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">supposed to be even smaller than atoms. Atoms</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are conceived of ?.s being composed partly of re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">volving electrons. Even in solid substances such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as iron, or human skin, some of these electrons</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are revolving in their various atoms about a central</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nucleus, others are in the nucleus. And now comes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the interesting speculation; these electrons being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miniature worlds like ours, have they miniature</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   There is no reason to suppose that sentient life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is coniined to beings like ourselves.

What "soul"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is nobody knows. With us it is certainly within</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the human organism, but elsewhere it may not be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There is no limit also to speculation as to what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">takes place in the microscopical world. Perhaps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our world, this little planet, bears the relation to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the vast cosmos around us and above us, that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">atom in our finger bears to our whole body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now as a conclusion, I would like to make a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suggestion that there should be more illustrations</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in Amazing Stories magazine; they help con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">siderably in bringing the story more to life as it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were; the illustrations by Paul are indeed excellent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">David R.

A typical example of what the cover (or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rather cover design) did to a prospective buyer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> happened last night. Looking over the rack of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> magazines a man was attracted by the blinding,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> searing yellow background of your magazine. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hesitated whether he should pick the periodical up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> or not; but curiosity got the best of him. Picking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it off the rack he glanced through the contents</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> gingerly, as though afraid the loud colors woxild</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> burn his hands. I approached the man, as I al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ways do, when someone picks up Amazing Stories,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and told him what a wonderful magazine it really</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> is; how I have read every issue since the first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> one, and how I would not trade any magazine out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> for this one. I showed him the "Discussions De-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> partment" and then had to go away to "jerk" a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> few sodas. When I glanced up, I saw the man look</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at the cover, sadly shake his head, and walk out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another sale lost because curiosity which attracts,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> can not make one buy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   For the simple reason that there are more non-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> readers than readers I suggest for your benefit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that you put a more conservative cover on your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> magazine which would gain you many more readers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Radio News in its July issue had a cover</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that attracted, and produced sales for you, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If this letter has not yet reached the way of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all superfluous mail, and if it gets into "Dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cussion," please don't tell me how great an artist</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Paul is, and how many praising letters you received</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on his work, for he suits me also.

"There-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore it must remain unknown," some might con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clude. Not so.

The sense of the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception of spiritual values or what has sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">been called the reality that lies behind the material</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe. You see now, don't you, why I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">rightly call its (the soul's) discovery a scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">one? It is rather an art.

I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved this for myself as many others have, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">one cannot prove these things to another; one has</seg><seg type="columnLine">to "taste and see" for himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Religion is based on this faculty of the "percep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of reality," but as only a few have the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistence to go ahead with the discipline necessary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">religion has been handed on to the masses as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere matter of faith. The leaders themselves have</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost sight of the vision of the founder of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">religion, and this leads to the teaching of "faith,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">etc., etc. Imagine Edison, for instance, asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">people to accept the statement that he had discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the electric light. He wouldn't get away with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for very long would he? But mankind has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained to think of spiritual things as "sacred"</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the priests .or those "in authority" and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts to make discoveries and* to tell people the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth have been (sometimes violently) discouraged!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But enough of this. Now what have we actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered? But here I want to say, don't take my</seg><seg type="columnLine">word for it; please don't! Just challenge my state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment to the point of desiring to test it and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">you too, or anybody for that matter, can find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things for himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1st. Man does not really die. There is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. As to what happens after the "change"</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes, don't ask me that.
