As science advances, scientifiction will</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance and flourish. No one of to-day can even dimly fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what it may produce. There was a time when science</seg><seg type="columnLine">made scientifiction. The time lias already come when scienti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiction makes science. The author who</seg><seg type="columnLine">works out a brand new idea in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientifiction plot may be hailed as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">original inventor years later, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain-child will have taken wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when cold-blooded scientists will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have realized the author's ambition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">An author may not know how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">build or make his invention of a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain apparatus or instrument, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">may know how to predict, and often</seg><seg type="columnLine">does predict, the use of such a one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The professional inventor or scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">then comes along, gets the stimulus</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the story and promptly responds</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the material invention. It may</seg><seg type="columnLine">not always work out this way, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is conceivable that it might in the fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. The reason is that inventors and scientists, as a rule,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have their noses close to the grindstone, whereas it takes an</seg><seg type="columnLine">author with vision to sec ahead and so to start others thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">along new lines. The inventor or scientist may not always</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit the truth of this, but the fact nevertheless remains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that both are susceptible to all sorts of outside influences,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than they will admit even to themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought occurred to me, therefore, that what scienti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiction needs at present is some sort of a label--an emblem,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a trade-mark, so to speak. Scientifiction is too good a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing just to be used as a word in mere letters. It should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have some dignity, and the idea itself of scientifiction should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have its own crest, henceforth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After I had come to this pass, I sat down and composed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the design that now adorns the front cover of this issue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not being a draftsman or an artist, I explained my idea to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">$300.00 IN PRIZES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">First Prize.........$100.00 </seg><seg type="columnLine">Second Prize.......    75.00</seg><seg type="columnLine">Third Prize........    50.00</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fourth Prize.......    25.00</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fifth and Sixth Prize,      </seg><seg type="columnLine">each ............      15.00</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seventh-Tenth, each    5.00 </seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is pictured exactly what it is.

And when it was a fit and proper thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to do so, Mr. Morris died. His tomb was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of marble, and, without any art nonsense or lauda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory inscription, quietly imposing--such being the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion of his time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He underwent various changes according to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted customs in these cases, and long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">this story begins, even his bones had become dust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were scattered to the four quarters of heaven.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And his sons and his grandsons and his great-grand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons and his great-great-grandsons, they too were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust and ashes, and were scattered likewise.

The establishment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Suranna Hat Syndicate projected n vast facade upon the outer way, sending overhead an overlapping series of huge white glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrcens, on which gigantic animated pictures of the faces of well-known beautiful living women wearing novelties in hats were thrown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">7</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">machine that talked to him as he made his toilet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a morning, might have been the voice of a rein-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carnated Blowitz when it dealt with the world's</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs. This phonographic machine was the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shape of a Dutch clock, and down the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it were electric barometric indicators, and an elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric clock and calendar, and automatic engagement</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminders, and where the clock would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the mouth of a trumpet. When it had news,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trumpet gobbled like a turkey, "Galloop, galloop,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then brayed out its message as, let us say, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trumpet might bray. It would tell Mwres in full,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich, throaty tones about the overnight accidents to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the omnibus flying-machines that plied around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, the latest arrivals at the fashionable resorts</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Tibet, and of all the great monopolist company</seg><seg type="columnLine">meetings of the day before, while he was dressing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If Mwres did not like hearing what it said, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to touch a stud, and it would choke a little and</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk about something else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course his toilet differed very much from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of his ancestor. It is doubtful which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been the more shocked and pained to find him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in the clothing of the other. Mwres would cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly have sooner gone forth to the world stark</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked than in the silk hat, frock coat, grey trousers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watch-chain that had filled Mr. Morris with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sombre self-respect in the past. For Mwres there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no shaving to do: a skilful operator had long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago removed every hair-root from his face. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs he encased in pleasant pink and amber garments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an nir-tight material, which with the help of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingeu-.uts little pump he distended so as to suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous muscles. Above this he also wore pneu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic garments beneath an amber silk tunic, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was clothed in air and admirably protected against</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden extremes of heat or cold. Over this he flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scarlet cloak with its edge fantastically curved. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, which had been skilfully deprived of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrap of hair, he adjusted a pleasant little cap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright scarlet, held on by suction and inflated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen, and curiously like a comb of a cock. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">his toilet was complete; and, conscious of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">soberly and becomingly attired, he was ready to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellow-beings with a tranquil eve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS Mwres--'the civility of "Mr." had vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages ago--was one of the officials under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wind Vane and Waterfall Trust, the great company</seg><seg type="columnLine">that owned every wind wheel and waterfall in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, and which pumped all the water and supplied</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the electric energy that people in these latter days</seg><seg type="columnLine">required. He lived in a vast hotel near that part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of London called Seventh Way, and had very large</seg><seg type="columnLine">and comfortable apartments on the seventeenth floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Households and family life had long since disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared with the progressive refinement of manners;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and indeed the steady rise in rents and land values,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disappearance of domestic servants, the elabora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of cookery, had rendered the separate domicile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Victorian times impossible, even had any one de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sired such a savage seclusion. When his toilet was</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed he went towards one of the two doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his apartment--there were doors at opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends, each marked with a huge arrow pointing one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one way and one the other--touched a stud to open</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and emerged on a wide passage, the centre of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which bore chairs and was moving at a steady pace</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the left. On some of these chairs, gaily-dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and women were seated. He nodded to an ac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">quaintance--it was not in those days etiquette to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk before breakfast--and seated himself on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these chairs, and in a few seconds he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried to the doors of a lift, by which he descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the great and splendid hall in which his breakfast</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be automatically served.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a very different meal from a Victorian</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast. The rude masses of bread needing to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">carved and smeared over with animal fat before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be made palatable, the still recognisable frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of recently killed animals, hideously charred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hacked, the eggs torn ruthlessly from beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">some protesting hen,--such things as these, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they constituted the ordinary fare of Victorian times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have awakened only horror and disgust in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">refined minds of the people of these latter days. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead were pastes and cakes of agreeable and varie-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gated design, without any suggestion in colour or</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of the unfortunate animals from which their</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance and juices were derived. They appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">on little dishes sliding out upon a rail from a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">box at one side of the table. The surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, to judge by touch and eye, would have appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a nineteenth-century person to be covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine white damask, but this was really an oxidised</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic surface, and could be cleaned instantly after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a meal. There were hundreds of such little tables</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hall, and at most of them were other latter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day citizens singly or in groups. And as Mwres</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated himself before his elegant repast, the invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">orchestra, which had been resting during an interval,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed and filled the air with music.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Mwres did not display any great interest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either in his breakfast or the music; his eye wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered incessantly about the hall, as though he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected a belated guest. At last he rose eagerly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved his hand, and simultaneously across the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared a tall dark figure in a costume of yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and olive green. As this person, walking amidst the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables with measured steps, drew near, the pallid</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnestness of his face and the unusual intensity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes became apparent. Mwres reseated himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointed to a chair beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I feared you would never come," he said. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of the intervening space of time, the English</seg><seg type="columnLine">language was still almost exactly the same as it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in England under Victoria the Good. The in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention of the phonograph and such like means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">recording sound, and the gradual replacement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">books by such contrivances, had not only saved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human eyesight from dccay, but had also by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">establishment of a sure standard arrested the process</seg><seg type="columnLine">of change in accent that had hitherto been so in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was delayed by an interesting case," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in green and yellow. ''A prominent politican--</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahem!--suffering from overwork." He glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breakfast and seated himself. "1 have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake for forty hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh dear!" said Mwres: "fancy that!

"It didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter then if they were a bit silly or faddy. Life</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so easy-going then. No competition worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking of--no pressure. A human being had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">very lopsided before anything happened.

"In these confounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">historical romances that every one is listening to,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they always rescue a beautiful girl from an asylum</seg><seg type="columnLine">or something of the sort. I don't know if you attend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that rubbish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "1 must confess I do," said the hypnotist. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">carries one out of one's self to hear of those quaint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventurous, half-civilized days of the nineteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">century, when men were stout and women simple. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a good swaggering story before all things. Curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous times they were, with their smutty railways and</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffing old iron trains, their rum little houses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their horse vehicles. I suppose you don't read</seg><seg type="columnLine">books ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dear, no!" said Mwres, "I went to a modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">school and we had none of that old-fashioned non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense. Phqnographs are good enough for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," said the hypnotist, "of course"; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">surveyed the table for his next choice. "You know,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, helping himself to a dark blue confection</seg><seg type="columnLine">that promised well, "in those days our business was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely thought of. I daresay if any one had told</seg><seg type="columnLine">them that in two hundred years' time a class of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be entirely occupied in impressing things upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the memory, effacing unpleasant ideas, controlling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and overcoming instinctive but undesirable impulses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so forth, by means of hypnotism, they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have refused to believe the thing possible.

And be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side her sat her slender, handsome lover reading her</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poem he bad written that morning while on duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the stage. When he had finished, they sat for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time in silence; and then, as if for their special en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tertainment, the great machine that had come flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air from America that morning rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down out of the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At first it was a little oblong; faint and blue amidst</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distant fleecy clouds; and then it grew swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">large and white, and larger and whiter, until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the separate tiers of sails, each hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet wide, and the lank body they supported, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last even the swinging seats of the passengers in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dotted row. Although it was falling, it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to be rushing up the sky, and, over the roof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaces of the city below, its shadow leapt towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They heard the whistling rush of the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it and its yelling siren, shrill and swelling, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">warn those who were on its landing-stage of its ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival. And abruptly the note fell down a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">octaves, and it had passed, and the sky was clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and void, and she could turn her sweet eyes again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Denton at her side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their silcnce ended; and Denton, speaking in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little language of broken English that was, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancied, their private possession--though lovers have</seg><seg type="columnLine">used such little languages since the world began--</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her how they too would leap into the air one</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning out of all the obstacles and difficulties about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and fly to a sunlit city of delight he knew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Japan, half-way about the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She loved the dream, but she feared the leap; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she put him off with "Some day, dearest one, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day," to all his pleading that it might be soon; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last came a shrilling of whistles, and it was time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to go back to his duties on the stage. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted--as lovers have been wont to part for thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of years. She walked down a passage to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift, and so came to one of the streets of that latter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day London, all glazed in with glass, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather, and with incessant moving platforms that</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to all parts of the city. And by one of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">she returned to her apartments in the Hotel for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Women where she lived, the apartments that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in telephonic communication with all the best lec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turers in the world. But the sunlight of the flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage was in her heart, and the wisdom of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best lecturers in the world seemed folly in that light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She spent the middle part of the day in the gym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nasium, and took her midday meal with two other</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls and their common chaperone--for it was still</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the custom to have a chaperone in the case of mother-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less girls of the more prosperous classes. The chap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erone had a visitor that day, a man in green and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow, with a white face and vivid eyes, who talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazingly. Among other things, he fell to praising</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new historical romance that one of the great pop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular story-tellers of the day had just put forth. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, of course, about the spacious times of Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Victoria; and the author, among other pleasing novel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties, made a little argument before each section of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the story, in imitation of the chapter headings of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old-fashioned books; as for example, "How the Cab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of Pimlico stopped the Victoria Omnibuses, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Great Fight in Palace Yard," and "How the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piccadilly Policeman was Slain in the Midst of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duty." The man in green and yellow praised this</seg><seg type="columnLine">innovation. "These pithy sentences," he said, "are</seg><seg type="columnLine">admirable. They show at a glance those headlong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumultuous times, when men and animals jostled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the filthy streets, and death might wait for one at</seg><seg type="columnLine">every corner. Life was life then! How great the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world must have seemed then! How marvellous!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were still parts of the world absolutely unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plored.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he scarcely seemed to notice her as he talked. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on to describe a new method of entertaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. They were hypnotised, 'and then suggestions</seg><seg type="columnLine">were made to them so skilfully that they seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be living in ancient times again. They played out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little romance in the past as vivid as reality, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when at last they awakened, they remembered all</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been through as though it were a real</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''It is a thing we have sought to do for years and</seg><seg type="columnLine">years," said the hypnotist.

Think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all it opens out to us--the enrichment of our ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience, the recovery of adventure, the refuge it</seg><seg type="columnLine">offers from this sordid, competitive life in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we live! Think!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you can do that!" said the chaperone eagerly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The thing is possible at last," the hypnotist said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You may order a dream as you wish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chaperone was the first to be hypnotised, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dream, she said, was wonderful, when she came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other two girls, encouraged by her enthusiasm</seg><seg type="columnLine">also placed themselves in the hands of the hypnotist</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had plunges into the romantic past.

He had seen the instant surprise on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hypnotist's face. In that instant he knew. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up. He seemed to dominate the seated figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his side. He gripped the shoulder of green and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold. For a time he could not find words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give her vie back!" he said at last. "Give her</seg><seg type="columnLine">me back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?" gasped the hypnotist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give her me back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give whom?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Elizabeth Mwres--the girl--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hypnotist tried to free himself; he rose to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Denton's grip tightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let go!" cried the hypnotist, thrusting an arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Denton's chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment the two men were locked in a clumsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrestle. Neither had the slightest training--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">athleticism, except for exhibition and to afford op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity for betting, had faded out of the earth--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Denton was not only the younger but the stronger</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two. They swayed across the room, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hypnotist had gone down under his antagonist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They fell together. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton leaped to his feet, dismayed at his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury; but the hypnotist lay still, and suddenly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little white mark where his forehead had struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stool shot a hurrying band of red. For a space</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denton stood over him irresolute, trembling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fear of the consequences entered his gently nur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured mind. He turned towards the door. "No,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said aloud, and came back to the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Overcoming the instinctive repugnance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who had seen no act of violence in all his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, he knelt down beside his antagonist and felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart. Then he peered at the wound. He rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly and looked about him. He began to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When presently the hypnotist recovered his senses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head ached severely, his back was against Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's knees and Denton was sponging his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hypnotist did not speak. But presently he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicated by a gesture that in his opinion he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponged enough. "Let me get up," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet," said Denton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have assaulted me. you scoundrel!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are alone," said Denton, "and the door is</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was an interval of thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Unless I sponge," said Denton, "your forehead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will develop a tremendous bruise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You can go on sponging," said the hypnotist</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sulkily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was another pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"\\ e might be in the Stone Age." said the hyp-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">notist.

That</seg><seg type="columnLine">century, the nineteenth century, was the dawn of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new epoch in the history of mankind--the epoch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great cities, the end of the old order of country</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the beginning of the nineteenth. century the</seg><seg type="columnLine">majority of mankind still lived upon the countryside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as their way of life had been for countless genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. All over the world they dwelt in little towns</seg><seg type="columnLine">and villages then, and engaged either directly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">agriculture, or in occupations that were of service to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agriculturist. They travelled rarely, and dwelt</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to their work, because swift means of transit</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not yet come. The few who travelled went</seg><seg type="columnLine">either on foot, or in slow sailing-ships, or by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jogging horses incapable of more than sixty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day. Think of it!--sixty miles a day. Here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">th^re, in those sluggish times, a town grew a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger than its neighbors, as a port or as a centre of</seg><seg type="columnLine">government; but all the towns in the world with</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a hundred thousand inhabitants could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted on a man's fingers. So it was in the begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning of the nineteenth century. By the end, the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention of railways, telegraphs, steamships, and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plex agricultural machinery, had changed all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things; changed them beyond all hope of return.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The vast shops, the varied pleasures, the countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveniences of the larger towns were suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, and no sooner existed than they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought into competition with the homely resources</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rural centres. Mankind were drawn to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities by an overwhelming attraction. The demand</seg><seg type="columnLine">for labour fell with the increase of machinery, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">local markets were entirely superseded, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rapid growth of the larger centres at the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pense of the open country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flow of population townward was the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant preoccupation of Victorian writers. In Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Britain and New England, in India and China, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same thing was remarked; everywhere a few swol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">len towns were visibly replacing the ancient order.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That this was an inevitable result of improved means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of travel and transport--that, given swift means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">transit, these things must be--was realized by few;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the most puerile schemes were devised to over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come the mysterious magnetism of the urban centres,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and keep the people on the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the develQpments of the nineteenth century</seg><seg type="columnLine">were only the dawning of the new order. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">great cities of the new time were horribly incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venient, darkened by smoky fogs, insanitary and</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisy; but the discovery of new methods of building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">new methods of heating, changed all this. Between</seg><seg type="columnLine">1900 and 2000 the march of change was still more</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid; and between 2000 and 2100 the continually</seg><seg type="columnLine">accelerated progress of human invention made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reign of Victoria the Good seem at last an almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible vision of idyllic tranquil days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The introduction of railways was only the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">step in that development of those means of locomo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion which finally revolutionized human life. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">year 2000 railways and roads had vanished together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The railways, robbed of their..rails, had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">weedy ridges and ditches upon the face of the world;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the old roads, strange barbaric tracks of flint and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil, hammered by hand or rolled by rough iron roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, strewn with miscellaneous filth, and cut by iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoofs and wheels into ruts and puddles often many</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches deep, had been replaced by patent tracks made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a substance called Eadhamite. This Eadhamite--</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was named after its patentee--ranks with the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention of printing and steam as one of the epoch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">making discoveries of the world's history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Eadham discovered the substa xe, he prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably thought of it as a mere cheap substitute for</seg><seg type="columnLine">India rubber; it cost a few shillings a ton. But you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can never tell all an invention will do. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">genius of a man named Warming that pointed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility of using it, not only for the tires of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels, but as a road substance; it was he who</seg><seg type="columnLine">organized the enormous network of public ways that</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily covered the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These public ways were made with longitudinal</seg><seg type="columnLine">divisions. On the outer on either side went foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">cyclists and conveyances traveling at a less speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">than twenty-five miles an hour; in the middle, mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors capable of speed up to a hundred; and the inner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warming (in the face of enormous ridicule) re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served for vehicles travelling at speeds of a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour and upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For ten years his inner ways were vacant. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he died they were the most crowded of all, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast light frameworks with wheels of twenty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty feet in diameter, hurled along them at paces</seg><seg type="columnLine">that year after year rose steadily towards two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred miles an hour. And by the time this revolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">was accomplished, a parallel revolution had trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the ever-growing cities. Before the devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opment of practical science the fogs and filth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Victorian times vanished. Electric heating replaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires (in 2013 the lighting of a fire that did not ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely consume its own smoke was made an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dictable nuisance), and all the city ways, all public</seg><seg type="columnLine">squares and places, were covered in with a recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented glass-like substance. The rooting of Lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don became practically continuous. Certain short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighted and foolish legislation against tall buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">was abolished, and London, from a squat expanse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of petty houses--feebly archaic in design--rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily towards the sky. To the municipal respon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility for water, light, and drainage, was added</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, and that was ventilation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT to tell of all the changes in human con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venience that these two hundred years brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, to tell of the long foreseen invention of flying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to describe how life in households was steadily sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted by life in interminable hotels, how at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">even those who were still concerned in agricultural</seg><seg type="columnLine">work came to live in the towns and to go to and fro</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their work every day, to describe how at last in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all England only four towns remained, each with</seg><seg type="columnLine">many millions of people, and how there were left</seg><seg type="columnLine">no inhabited houses in all the countryside; to tell all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this would take us far from our story of Denton</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his Elizabeth. They had been separated and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">united, and still they could not marry. For Denton</seg><seg type="columnLine">■--it was his only fault--had no money. Neither had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth until she was twenty-one, and as yet she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only eighteen. At twenty-one, all the property</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her mother would come to her, for that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom of the time. She did not know that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to anticipate her fortune, and Denton was</seg><seg type="columnLine">.far too delicate a lover to suggest such a thing. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">things stuck hopelessly between them. Elizabeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that she was very unhappy, and that nobody un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood her but Denton, and that when she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from him she was wretched; and Denton said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his heart longed for her day and night. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">they met as often as they could to enjoy the discus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of their sorrows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They met one day at their little seat upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying stage. The precise site of this meeting was</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in Victorian times the road from Wimbledon</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out upon the common. They were, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred feet above that point. Their seat looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">far over London. To convey the appearance of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all to a nineteenth-century reader would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult. One would have had to tell him to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Crystal Palace, of the newly built "mammoth"</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotels--as those little affairs were called--of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger railway stations of his time, and to imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">such buildings enlarged to vast proportions and run</seg><seg type="columnLine">together and continuous over the whole metropolitan</seg><seg type="columnLine">area. If then he was told that this continuous roof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">space bore a huge forest of rotating wind-wheels, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have begun very dimly to appreciate what to</seg><seg type="columnLine">these young people was the commonest sight in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To their eyes it had something of the quality of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison, and they were talking, as they had talked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred times before, of how they might escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it and be at last happy together: escape from it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is, before the appointed three years were at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. It was, they both agreed, not only impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">but almost wicked, to wait three years. "Before that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Denton--and the notes of his voice told of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid chest--"we might both be dead!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Their vigorous young hands had to grip at this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then Elizabeth had a still more poignant thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that brought the tears from her wholesome eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down her healthy cheeks. "One of us," she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"one of us might be--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She choked; she could not say the word that is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible to the young and happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Yet to marry and be very poor in the cities of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time was--for any one who had lived pleasantly--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very dreadful thing. In the old agricultural days</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had drawn to an end in the eighteenth century</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been a pretty proverb of love in a cottage;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and indeed in those days the poor of the countryside</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dwelt in flower-covered, diamond-windowed cot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tages of thatch and plaster, with the sweet air and</seg><seg type="columnLine">.earth about them, amidst tangled hedges and the song</seg><seg type="columnLine">of birds, and with the ever-changing sky overhead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But all this had changed (the change was already be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning in the nineteenth century), and a new sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life was opening for the poor--in the lower quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the nineteenth century the lower quarters were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still beneath the sky; they were areas of land on</seg><seg type="columnLine">clay or other unsuitable soil, liable to floods or ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to the smoke of more fortunate districts, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently supplied with water, and as insanitary</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the great fear of infectious diseases felt by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealthier classes permitted. In the twenty-second</seg><seg type="columnLine">century, however, the growth of the city story above</seg><seg type="columnLine">story, and the coalescence of buildings, had led to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">different arrangement. The prosperous people lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a vast series of sumptuous hotels in the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">storeys and halls of the city fabric; the industrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">population dwelt beneath in the tremendous ground-</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor and basement, so to speak, of the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the refinement of life and manners these lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">classes differed little from their ancestors, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">East-enders of Queen Victoria's time; but they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed a distinct dialect of their own. In these</seg><seg type="columnLine">under ways they lived and died, rarely ascending to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface except when work took them there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since for most of them this was the sort of life to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they had been born, they found no great</seg><seg type="columnLine">misery in such circumstances; but for people like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denton and Elizabeth, such a plunge would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed more terrible than death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And yet what else is there?" asked Elizabeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denton professed not to know. Apart from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own feeling of delicacy, he was not sure how Eliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beth would like the idea of borrowing on the strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her expectations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passage from London to Pans even, said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth, was beyond their means; and in Paris, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any other city in the world, life would be just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">costly and impossible as in London.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well might Denton cry aloud: "If only we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived in those days, dearest! If only we had lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the past!" For to their eyes even nineteenth-cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tury Whitechapel was seen through a mist of</seg><seg type="columnLine">romance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is there nothing?" cried Elizabeth, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeping. "Must we really wait for those three long</seg><seg type="columnLine">years?

Well, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might shelter in some one of these, and repair it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hands.

His suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed an impossible dream to her, and perhaps for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reason she was eager for more detail. And in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venting for the most part as he went along, he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, how they might live in the country as the old-</seg><seg type="columnLine">world people had done.

"We</seg><seg type="columnLine">could carry food for ten or twelve days."

In a week</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so it was quite possible. Another week, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the inevitable thing they had to do. A great en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiasm for the country seized hold of them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed them. The sordid tumult of the town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they said, overwhelmed them. They marvelled that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this simple way out of their troubles had never come</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One morning near Midsummer-day, there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new minor official upon the flying stage, and Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's place was to know him no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our two young people had secretly married, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going forth manfully out of the city in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they and their ancestors before them had lived all</seg><seg type="columnLine">their days.

In their days the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawling suburbs of Victorian times with their vile</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads, petty houses, foolish little gardens of shrub</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and geranium, and all their futile, pretentious priva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cies had disappeared; the towering buildings of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new age, the mechanical ways, the electric and water</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains, all came to an end together like a wall, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cliff, near four hundred feet in height, abrupt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer. All about the city spread the carrot, swede,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turnip fields of the Food Company, vegetables</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were the basis of a thousand varied foods, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeds and hedgerow tangles had been utterly ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirpated. The incessant expense of weeding that</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on year after year in the petty, wasteful and</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbaric farming of the ancient days, the Food Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany had economised for ever more by a campaign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of extermination. Here and there, however, neat</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of bramble standards and apple trees with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitewashed stems, intersected the fields, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">places groups of gigantic teazles reared their fav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oured spikes. 1 lere and there huge agricultural ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines hunched under waterproof covers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingled waters of the Wey and Mole and Wandle</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran in rectangular channels; and wherever a gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevation of the ground permitted a fountain of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">odorised sewage distributed its benefits athwart the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and made a rainbow 01 the sunlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By a great archway in that enormous city wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged the Eadhamite road to Portsmouth, swarm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the morning sunshine with an enormous traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing the blue-clad servants of the Food Company</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their toil. A rushing traffic, beside which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed two scarce-moving dots. Along the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks hummed and rattled the tardy little old-fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned motors of such as had duties within twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles or so of the city; the inner ways were filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with vaster mechanisms--swift monocycles bearing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">score of men, lank multicycles, quadricycles sagging</seg><seg type="columnLine">with heavy loads, empty gigantic produce carts that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come back again filled before the sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting, all with throbbing engines and noiseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels and a perpetual wild melody of horns and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gongs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Along the very verge of the outermost way our</seg><seg type="columnLine">young people went in silence, newly wed and oddly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shy of one another's company.

By mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day they had come so near that they could see here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there little patches of pallid dots--the sheep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meat Department of the Food Company owned. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">another hour they had passed the clay and the root</seg><seg type="columnLine">crops and the single fence that hedged them in, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prohibition against trespass no longer held: the</seg><seg type="columnLine">levelled roadway plunged into a cutting with all its</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic, and they could leave it and walk over *the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greensward and up the open hillside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never had these children of the latter days been</seg><seg type="columnLine">together in such a lonely place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were both very hungry and footsore--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking was a rare exercise--and presently they sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the weedless, close-cropped grass, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back for the first time at the city from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had come, shining wide and splendid in the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">haze of the valley of the Thames. Elizabeth was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little afraid of the unenclosed sheep away up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope--she had never been near big unrestrained</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals before--but Denton reassured her. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead a white-winged bird circled in the blue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They talked but little until they had eaten, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then their tongues were loosened. He spoke of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness that was now certainly theirs, of the folly</seg><seg type="columnLine">of not breaking sooner out of the magnificent prison</seg><seg type="columnLine">of latter-day life, of the old romantic days that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed from the world for ever. And then he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came boastful. He took up the sword that lay on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground beside him, and she took it from his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran a tremulous finger along the blade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you could," she said, "you--could raise this</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strike a man ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed quite close to a huge flock of sheep, who stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bleated at their unaccustomed figures. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen sheep before, and she shivered to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">such gentle things must needs he slain for food. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheep-dog barked from a distance, and then a shep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd appeared amidst the supports of the wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels, and came down towards them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he drew near he called out asking whither</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton hesitated, and told him briefly that theji</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought some ruined house among the Downs, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they might live together. He tried to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an off-hand manner, as though it was a usual thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. The man stared incredulously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you done anything?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing," said Denton.

Why should we live in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shepherd stared more incredulously than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. "You can't live here," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We mean to try."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shepherd stared from one to the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'll go back to-morrow," he said. "It looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant enough in the sunlight. . . . Are you sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've done nothing? We shepherds are not such</seg><seg type="columnLine">great friends of the police."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton looked at him steadfastly. "No," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But we are too poor to live in the city, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't bear the thought of wearing clothes of blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas and doing drudgery. We are going to live</seg><seg type="columnLine">a simple life here, like the people of old."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shepherd was a bearded man with a thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful face.

That</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was once a town called Epsom. There are no houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and the bricks have been used for a sheep</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen. Go on, and another heap on the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">root-land is Leatherhead; and then the hill turns</seg><seg type="columnLine">away along the border of a valley, and there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods of beech. Keep along the crest. You will</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to quite wild places. In some parts, in spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the weeding that is done, ferns and bluebells</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other such useless plants are growing still. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it all underneath the wind-wheels runs a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight lane paved with stones, a roadway of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Romans two thousand years old. Go to the right of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, down into the valley and follow it along by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks of the river. You come presently to a street</seg><seg type="columnLine">of houses, many with the roofs still sound upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. There you may find shelter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They thanked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it's a quiet place.

The phonographs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the story-tellers, the kinematograph entertain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, the news machines--none of them are to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found there. If you are hungry there is no food,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you are ill 110 doctor. . . He stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall try it," said Denton, moving to go on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a thought struck him, and he made an agree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment with the shepherd, and learnt where they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">find him, to buy and bring them anything of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stood in need, out of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND in the evening they came to the deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">village, with its houses that seemed so small</seg><seg type="columnLine">and odd to them: they found it golden in the glory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sunset, and desolate and still. They went from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one deserted house to another, marvelling at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaint simplicity, and debating which they should</seg><seg type="columnLine">choose. And at last, in a sunlit corner of a room</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had lost its outer wall, they came upon a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower, a little flower of blue that the weeders of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Food Company had overlooked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That house they decided upon; but they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain in it long that night, because they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolved to feast upon nature. And moreover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">.louses became very gaunt and shadowy after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight had faded out of the sky. So after they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had rested a little time they went to the crest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill again to see with their own eyes the silence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaven set with stars, about which the old poets had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had so many things to tell. It was a wonderful sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Denton talked like the stars, and when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down the hill at last the sky was pale with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn. They slept but, little, and in the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they woke a thrush was singing in a tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So these young people of the twenty-second cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tury began their exile. That morning they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very busy exploring the resources of this new home</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which they were going to live the simple life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They did not explore very fast or very far, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went everywhere hand-in-hand; but they found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginnings of some furniture. Beyond the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage was a store of winter fodder for the sheep of.</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Food Company, and Denton dragged great arm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuls to the house to make a bed; and in several of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the houses were old fungus-eaten chairs and tables</seg><seg type="columnLine">--rough, barbaric, clumsy furniture, it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and made of wood. They repeated many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the things they had said on the previous day, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards evening they found another flower, a hare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell. In the late afternoon some Company shep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">herds went down the river valley riding on a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">multicycle; but they hid from them, because their</seg><seg type="columnLine">-presence, Elizabeth said, seemed to spoil the romance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this old-world place altogether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this fashion they lived a week. For all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">week the days were cloudless, and the nights, nights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of starry glory, that were invaded each a little more</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a crescent moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Yet something of the first splendour of their com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing faded--faded imperceptibly day after day; Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's eloquence became fitful, and lacked fresh topics</seg><seg type="columnLine">of inspiration; the fatigue of their long march from</seg><seg type="columnLine">London told in a certain stiffness of the limbs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each suffered from a slight unaccountable cold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, Denton became aware of unoccupied time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In one place among the carelessly heaped lumber of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old times he found a rust-eaten spade, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this he made a fitful attack on the razed and grass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown garden--though he had nothing to plant or</seg><seg type="columnLine">sow. He returned to Elizabeth with a sweat-stream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing face, after half an hour of such work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There were giants in those days," he said, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding what wont and training will do. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">their walk that day led them along the hills until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could see the city shimmering far away in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley. "I wonder how things are going on there,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then came a change in the weather. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and see the clouds," she cried; and behold! they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a sombre purple in the north and east, stream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up to ragged edges at the zenith. And as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went up the hill these hurrying streamers blotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the sunset. Suddenly the wind set the beech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees swaying and whispering, and Elizabeth shiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered. And then far away the lightning flashed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed like a sword that is drawn suddenly, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant thunder marched about the sky, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they stood astonished, pattering upon them came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first headlong raindrops of the storm. In an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant the last streak of sunset was hidden by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling curtain of hail, and the lightning flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and the voice of the thunder roared louder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all about them the world scowled dark and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Seizing hands, these children of the city ran down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hill to their home, in infinite astonishment. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">ere they reached it. Elizabeth was weeping with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismay, and the darkling ground about them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">white and brittle and active with the pelting hail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then began a strange and terrible night for them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the first time in their civilised lives they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in absolute darkness; they were wet and cold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivering, all about them hissed the hail, and through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long neglected ceilings of the derelict home came</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisy spouts of water and formed pools and rivulets</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the creaking floors. As the gusts of the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the worn-out building, it groaned and shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered, and now a mass of plaster from the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">would slide and smash, and now some loosened tile</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rattle down the roof and crash into the empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenhouse below. Elizabeth shuddered, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still; Denton wrapped his gay and flimsy city cloak</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her, and so they crouched in the darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And ever the thunder broke louder and nearer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever more lurid flashed the lightning, jerking into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a momentary gaunt clearness the steaming, dripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">room in which they sheltered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never before had they been in the open air save</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the sun was shining. All their time had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spent in the warm and airy ways and halls and rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the latter-day city. It was to them that night</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if they were in some other world, some disordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaos of stress and tumult, and almost beyond hop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that they should ever see the city ways again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The storm seemed to last interminably, until at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last they dozed between the thunderclaps, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">very swiftly it fell and ceased. And as the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">patter of the rain died away they heard an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ffTTTTIAT is that?" cried Elizabeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> VV It came again. It was the barking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs. It drove down the desert lane and passed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through the window, whitening the wall before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and throwing upon it the shadow of the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow-frame and of a tree in black silhouette, shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light of the waxing moon. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as the pale dawn was drawing the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them into sight, the fitful barking of dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">came near again, and stopped. They listened. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pause they heard the quick pattering of feet seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing round the house, and short, half-smothered barks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then again everything was still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ssh!" whispered Elizabeth, and pointed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of their room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton went half-way towards the door, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood listening. He came back with a face of af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected unconcern. "They must be the sheep-dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Food Company," he said. "They will do us</seg><seg type="columnLine">no harm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down again beside her. "What a night</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has been!" he said, to hide how keenly he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't like dogs," answered Elizabeth, after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dogs never hurt any one," said Denton. "In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old days--in the nineteenth century--everybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a dog."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was a romance I heard once. A dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed a man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not this sort of dog," said Denton confidently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Some of those romances--are exaggerated."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Suddenly a half bark and a pattering up the stair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">case; the sound of panting. Denton sprang to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and drew the sword out of the damp straw upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they had been lying. Then in the doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared a gaunt sheep-dog, and halted there. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind it stared another. For an instant man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute faced each other, hesitating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Denton, being ignorant of dogs, made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp step forward. "Go away," he said, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsy motion of his sword.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dog started and growled. Denton stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply. "Good dog!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The growling jerked into a bark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good dog!" said Denton. The second dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled and barked. A third out of sight down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">staircase took up the barking also. Outside others</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave tongue--a large number, it seemed to Denton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is annoying," said Denton, without taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye off the brutes before him. "Of course the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shepherds won't come out of the city for hours yet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naturally these dogs don't quite make us out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't hear!" shouted Elizabeth. She stood up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton tried again, but the barking still drowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice. The sound had a curious effect upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood. Odd disused emotions began to stir; his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">18</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">changed as lie shouted. He tried again; the bark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing seemed to mock him, and one dog danced a pace</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, bristling. Suddenly he turned, and utter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing certain words in the dialect of the underways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">words incomprehensible to Elizabeth, he made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dogs. There was a sudden cessation of the bark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, a growl and a snapping. Elizabeth saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarling head of the foremost dog, its white teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and retracted ears, and the flash of the thrust blade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The brute leapt into the air and was flung back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Denton, with a shout, was driving the dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. The sword flashed above his head with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden new freedom of gesture, and then he van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished down the staircase. She made six steps to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow him, and on the landing there was blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stopped, and hearing the tumult of dogs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denton's shouts pass out of the house, ran to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nine wolfish sheep-dogs were scattering, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhed before the porch; and Denton, tasting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange delight of combat that slumbers still in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood of even the most civilized man, was shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and running across the garden space. And then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw something that for a moment he did not see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dogs circled round this way and that, and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. They had him in the open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In an instant she divined the situation. She would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have called to him. For a moment she felt sick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless, and then, obeying a strange impulse, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered up her white skirt and ran downstairs. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hall was the rusting spade. That was it! She</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized it and ran out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She came none too soon. One dog rolled before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, well-nigh slashed in hal f; but a second had him</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the thigh, a third gripped his collar behind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fourth had the blade of the sword between its</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth, tasting its own blood. He parried the leap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fifth with his left arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It might have been the first century instead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-second, so far as she was concerned. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gentleness of her eighteen years of city life van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished before the primordial need. The spade smote</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard and sure, and cleft a dog's skull. Another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouching for a spring, yelped with dismay at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected antagonist, and rushed aside. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted precious moments on the binding of a femi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine skirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The collar of Denton's cloak tore and parted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he staggered back; and that dog too felt the Spade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ceased to trouble him. He sheathed his sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the brute at his thigh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the wall!" cried Elizabeth; and in three sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds the fight was at an end, and our young people</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood side by side, while a remnant of five dogs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ears and tails of disaster, fled shamefully from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stricken field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment they stood panting and victorious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then Elizabeth, dropping her spade, covered her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and sank to the ground in a paroxysm of weep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Denton looked about him, thrust the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sword into the ground so that it was at hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stooped to comfort her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT last their more tumultuous emotions subsided,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they could talk again. She leant upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, and he sat upon it so that he could keep an eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">open for any returning dogs. Two, at any rate, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on the hillside and keeping up a vexatious barking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was tear-stained, but not very wretched now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because for half an hour he had been repeating that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she was brave and had saved his life. But a new</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fear was growing in her mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are the dogs of the Food Company," she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said. "There will be trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am afraid so. Very likely they will prosecute</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us for trespass."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the old times," he said, "this sort of thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">happened day after day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Last night!" she said. "I could not live through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">another such night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at her. Her face was pale for want of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sleep, and drawn and haggard. He came to a sudden</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">resolution. "We must go back," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at the dead dogs, and shivered. "We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cannot stay here," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must go back," he repeated, glancing over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder to see if the enemy kept their distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We have been happy for a time. . . . Ryt the world</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is too civilized. Ours is the age of cities. More</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of this will kill us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what are we to do? How can we live there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Denton hesitated. His heel kicked against the wall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on which he sat. "It's a thing I haven't mentioned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">before," he said, and coughed; "but . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You could raise money on your expectations,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Could I ?" she said eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course you could. What a child you are!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stood up, and her face was bright. "Why did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you not tell me before?" she asked. "And all this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time we have been here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at her for a moment, and smiled. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the smile vanished. "I thought it ought to come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from you," he said. "I didn't like to ask for your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">money. And besides--at first I thought this would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be rather fine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has been fine," he said; and glanced once more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder. "Until all this began."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," she said, "those first days. The first three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They looked for a space into one another's faces,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and then Denton slid down from the wall and took</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To each generation," he said, "the life of its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time. I see it all plainly now. In the city--that is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the life to which we were born. To live in any other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fashion. . . . Coming here was a dream, and this--is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the awakening."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a pleasant dream," she said,--"in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beginning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long space neither spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we would reach the city before the shepherds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come here, we must start," said Denton. "We must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">get our food out of the house and eat as we go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Denton glanced about him again, and, giving the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dead dogs a wide berth, they walked across the gar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">den space and into the house together. They found .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the wallet with their food, and descended the blood-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stained stairs again. In the hall Elizabeth stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"One minute," she said. "There is something here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She led the way into the room in which that one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little blue flower was blooming. She stooped to it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she touched it with her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want it," she said; and then, "I cannot take</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it____"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Impulsively she stooped and kissed its petals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then silently, side by side, they went across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">empty garden-space into the old high road, and set</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their faces resolutely towards the distant city--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">towards the complex mechanical city of those latter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">days, the city that had swallowed up mankind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Ways of the City</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PROMINENT if not paramount among world-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing inventions in the history of man is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that series of contrivances in locomotion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">began with the railway and ended for a century or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more with the motor and the patent road. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">these contrivances, together with the device of lim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ited liability joint stock companies and the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">session of agricultural laborers by skilled men with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingenious machinery, would necessarily concentrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind in cities of unparalleled magnitude and</seg><seg type="columnLine">work an entire revolution in human life, became,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the event, a thing so obvious that it is a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of astonishment it was not more clearly anticipated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet that any steps should be taken to anticipate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miseries such a revolution might entail does not ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear even to have been suggested; and the idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moral prohibitions and sanctions, the privileges</seg><seg type="columnLine">and concessions, the conception of property and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsibility, of comfort and beauty, that had ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered the mainly agricultural states of the past pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perous and happy, would fail in the rising torrent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of novel opportunities and novel stimulations, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to have entered the nineteenth-century mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That a citizen, kindly and fair in his ordinary life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could as a shareholder become almost murderously</seg><seg type="columnLine">greedy; that commercial methods that were reason-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able and honorable on the old-fashioned countryside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should on an enlarged scale be deadly and over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelming ; that ancient charity was modern pauperi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zation, and ancient employment modern sweating;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, in fact, a revision and enlargement of the duties</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rights of man had become urgently necessary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were things it could not entertain, nourished as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on an archaic system of education and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundly restrospective and legal in all its habits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. It was known that the accumulation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in cities involved unprecedented dangers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pestilence; there was an energetic development of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanitation; but that the diseases of gambling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">usury, of luxury and tyranny should become en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demic, and produce horrible consequences was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the scope of nineteenth-century thought. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, as if it were some inorganic process, practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhindered by the creative will of man, the growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the swarming unhappy cities that mark the twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">first century accomplished itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The new society was divided into three main</seg><seg type="columnLine">classes. At the summit slumbered the property</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner, enormously rich by accident rather than de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign, potent save for the will and aim, the last avatar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Hamlet in the world. Below was the enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude of workers employed by the gigantic com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panies that monopolized control; and between these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two the dwindling middle class, officials of innumer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able sorts, foremen, managers, the medical, legal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">artistic, and scholastic classes, and the minor rich, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle class whose members led a life of insecure</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxury and precarious speculation amidst the move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of the great managers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Already the love story and the marrying of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons of this middle class have been told: how</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they overcame the obstacles between them, and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">they tried the simple old-fashioned way of living on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the countryside and came back speedily enough into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city of London. Denton had no means, so Eliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beth borrowed money on the securities that her father</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mwres held in trust for her until she was one-and-</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rate of interest she paid was of course high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of the uncertainty of her security, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arithmetic of lovers is often sketchy and optimistic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet they had very glorious times after that return.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They determined they would not go to a Pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">city nor waste their days rushing through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one part of the world to the other, for in spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one disillusionment, their tastes were still old-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashioned. They furnished their little room with</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaint old Victorian furniture, and found a shop on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forty-second floor in Seventh Way, where printed</seg><seg type="columnLine">books of the old sort were still to be bought. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">their pet affectation to read print instead of hearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">phonographs. And when presently there came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet little girl, to unite them further if it were pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, Elizabeth would not send it to a Creche, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom was, but insisted on nursing it at home. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent of their apartments was raised on account of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this singular proceeding, but that they did not mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It only meant borrowing a little more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Elizabeth was of age. and Denton had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a business interview with her father that was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreeable. An exceedingly disagreeable interview</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their money-lender followed, from which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought home a white face. On his return Eliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beth had to tell him of a new and marvelous intona-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of "Goo" that their daughter had devised, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denton was inattentive. In the midst, just as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at the cream of her description, he interrupted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How much money do you think we have left, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that everything is settled?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stared and stopped her appreciative swaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Goo genius that had accompanied her de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scription.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't mean . . .?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he answered. "Ever so much. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been wild. It's the interest. Or something. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shares you had, slumped. Your father did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. Said it was not his business, after what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. He's going to marry again. . . . Well--</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have scarcely a thousand left!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only a thousand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only a thousand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Elizabeth sat down. For a moment she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded him with a white face, then her eyes went</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the quaint, old-fashioned room, with its mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle Victorian furniture and genuine oleographs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested at last on the little lump of humanity within</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DENTON glanced at her and stood downcast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he swung round on his heel and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down very rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must get something to do," he broke out pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently. "I am an idle scoundrel. I ought to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of this before. I have been a selfish fool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wanted to be with you all day ..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped, looking at her white face. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came and kissed her and the little face that nestled</seg><seg type="columnLine">against her breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all right, dear," he said, standing over her;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you won't be lonely now--now Dings is beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk to you. And I can soon get something to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you know. Soon . . . Easily . . . It's only a shock at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first. But it will come all right. It's sure to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. I will go out again as soon as I have rested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and find what can lie done. For the present it's hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think of anything . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''It would be hard to leave these rooms," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth; "but--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There won't be any need of that--trust me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are expensive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton waved that aside. He began talking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work he could do. He was not very explicit</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it would be; but he was quite sure that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something to keep them comfortably in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy middle class, whose way of life was the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one they knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are three-and-thirty million people in Lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don." he said: "some of them must have need of me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Some must."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The trouble is . . . Well--Bindon, that brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">little old man your father wanted you to marry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's an important person. ... I can't go back to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying-stage work, because he is now a Commissioner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Flying Stage Clerks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "1 didn't know that," said Elizabeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was made that in the last few weeks ... or</seg><seg type="columnLine">things would be easy enough, for they liked me on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying stage.

I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest a little while, and then we'll dine, and then I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">start on my rounds. I know lots of people--lots."</seg><seg type="columnLine">So they rested, and then they went to the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining-room and dined, and then he started on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for employment. But they soon realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the matter of one convenience the world was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as badly off as it had ever been, and that was a nice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure, honorable, remunerative employment, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample leisure for the private life, and demanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">no special ability, no violent exertion or risk, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sacrifice of any sort for its attainment. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolved a number of brilliant projects, and spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">many days hurrying from one part of the enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">city to another in search of influential friends; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his influential friends were glad to see him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">very sanguine until it came to definite proposals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then they became guarded and vague. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">part with them coldly, and think over their behavior,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get irritated on his way back, and stop at some</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone office and spend money on an animated but</seg><seg type="columnLine">unprofitable quarrel. And as the days passed, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got so worried and irritated that even to seem kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and careless before Elizabeth cost him an effort--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she, being a loving woman, perceived very clearly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After an extremely complex preface one day, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped him out with a painful suggestion. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected her to weep and give way to despair when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came to selling all their joyfully bought early Vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torian treasures, their quaint objects of art, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">antimacassars, bead mats, repp curtains, veneered</seg><seg type="columnLine">furniture, gold-framed steel engravings and pencil</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawings, wax flowers under shades, stuffed birds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all sorts of choice old things; but it was she</seg><seg type="columnLine">who made the proposal. The sacrifice seemed to fill</seg><seg type="columnLine">her with pleasure, and so did the idea of shifting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartments ten or twelve floors lower in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel. "So long as Dings is with us, nothing mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters," she said. "It's all experience." So he kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, said she was braver than when she fought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheep-dogs, called her Boadicea. and abstained very</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully from reminding her that they would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pay a considerably higher rent on account of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">little voice with which Dings greeted the perpetual</seg><seg type="columnLine">uproar of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His idea had been to get Elizabeth out of the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it came to selling the absurd furniture about</seg><seg type="columnLine">which their affections were twined and tangled; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it came to the sale it was Elizabeth who hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled with the dealer while Denton went about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">running ways of the city, white and sick with sor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row and the fear of what was still to come. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">they moved into their sparsely furnished pink-and-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white apartments in a cheap hotel, there came an</seg><seg type="columnLine">outbreak of furious energy on his part, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly a week of lethargy during which he sulked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at home. Through those days Elizabeth shone like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a star, and at the end Denton's misery found a vent</seg><seg type="columnLine">in tears. And then he went out into the city ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and--to his utter amazement--found some</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His standard of employment had fallen steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">until at last it had reached the lowest level of inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendent workers. At first he had aspired to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">high official position in the great Flying or Windvane</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Water Companies, or to an appointment on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the General Intelligence Organizations that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced newspapers, or to some professional part-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nership, but those were the dreams of the beginning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From that he had passed to speculation, and three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred gold "lions" out of Elizabeth's thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">had vanished one evening in the share market. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was glad his good looks secured him a trial in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position of salesman to the Suzannah Hat Syndicate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Syndicate dealing in ladies' caps, hair decorations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hats--for though the city was completely cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered in, ladies still wore extremely elaborate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful hats at the theatres and places of public</seg><seg type="columnLine">worship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT would have been amusing if one could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">confronted a Regent Street shopkeeper of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nineteenth century with the development of his estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lishment in which Denton's duties lay. Nineteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Way was still sometimes called Regent Street, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was now a street of moving platforms and nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight hundred feet wide. The middle space was</seg><seg type="columnLine">immovable and gave access by staircases descend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into subterranean ways to the houses on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Right and left were an ascending series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuous platforms each of which traveled about</seg><seg type="columnLine">five miles an hour faster than the one internal to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that one could step from platform to platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">until one reached the swiftest outer way and so go</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the city. The establishment of the Suzannah</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hat Syndicate projected a vast facade upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer way, sending out overhead at either end an</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlapping series of huge white glass screens, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which gigantic animated pictures of the faces of well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known beautiful living women wearing novelties in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hats were thrown. A dense crowd was always col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected in the stationary central way watching a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">kinematograph which displayed the changing fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion. The whole front of the building was in per- *</seg><seg type="columnLine">petual chromatic change, and all down the facadc--</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hundred feet it measured--and all across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street of moving ways, laced and winked and glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered in a thousand varieties of color and lettering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inscription--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Susanna! 'ets! Suzanna! 'ets!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A broadside of gigantic phonographs drowned all</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation in the moving way and roared "hats"</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at the passer-by, while far down the street and up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">other batteries counseled the public to "walk down</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Suzannah," and queried, "Why don't you buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl a hat ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the benefit of those who chanced to be deaf</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and deafness was not uncommon in the London</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that age, inscriptions of all sizes were thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the roof above upon the moving platforms</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, and on one's hand or on the bald head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the man l&gt;efore one, or on a lady's shoulders, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a sudden jet of flame before one's feet, the mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing finger wrote in unanticipated letters of fire "ets</seg><seg type="columnLine">r chip t'dc," or simply "cts." And despite all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts so high was the pitch at which the city lived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so trained became one's eyes and ears to ignore all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorts of advertisement, that many a citizen had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed that place thousands of times and was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaware of the existence of the Suzannah Hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syndicate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To enter the building one descended the staircase</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle way and walked through a public</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage in which pretty girls promenaded, girls who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were willing to wear a ticketed hat for a small fee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The entrance chamber was a large hall in which wax</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads fashionably adorned rotated gracefully upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedestals, and from this one passed through a cash</seg><seg type="columnLine">office to an interminable series of little rooms, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its salesman, its three or four hats and pins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its mirrors, its kinematographs, telephones and hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">slides in communication with the central depot, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable lounge and tempting refreshments. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">salesman in such an apartment did. Denton now be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. It was his business to attend to any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incessant stream of ladies who chose to stop with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. to behave as winningly as possible, to offer re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">freshment, to converse on any topic the possible cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomer chose, and to guide the conversation dexter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously but not insistently towards hats. He was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggest trying on various types of hat and to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his manner and bearing, but without any coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">flattery, the enhanced impression made by the hats</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie wished to sell. He had several mirrors, adapted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by various subtleties of curvature and tint to differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent types of face and complexion, and much de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended on the proper use of these.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton flung himself at these curious and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">very congenial duties with a good will and energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would have amazed him a year before; but all to</seg><seg type="columnLine">no purpose. The Senior Manageress, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected him for appointment and conferred various</seg><seg type="columnLine">small marks of favor upon him, suddenly changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her manner, declared for 110 assignable cause that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was stupid, and dismissed him at the end of six</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks of salesmanship. So Denton had to resume</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ineffectual search for employment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This second search did not last very long. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">money was at the ebb. To eke it out a little longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">they resolved to part with their darling Dings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took that small person to one of the public crbches</seg><seg type="columnLine">that abounded in the city. That was the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of the time. The industrial emancipation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, the correlated disorganization of the se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded "home," had rendered crt-chcs a necessity for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all but very rich and exceptionally-minded people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therein children encountered hygienic and educa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional advantages impossible without such organiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Creches were of all classes and types of luxury,</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to those of the labor Company, where children</seg><seg type="columnLine">were taken on credit, to be redeemed in labor as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they grew up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT both Denton and Elizabeth being, as I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained, strange old-fashioned young people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of nineteenth-century ideas, hated these con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venient crcchcs exceedingly and at last took their</seg><seg type="columnLine">little daughter to one with extreme reluctance. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were received by a motherly person in a uniform who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very brisk and prompt in her manner until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth wept at the mention of parting from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">child. The motherly person, after a brief astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at this unusual emotion, changed suddenly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a creature of hope and comfort, and so won Eliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beth's gratitude for life. They were conducted into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vast room presided over by several nurses and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of two-year-old girls grouped about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">toy-covered floor. This was the Two-year-old Room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two nurses came forward, and Elizabeth watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bearing towards Dings with jealous eyes. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were kind--it was clear they felt kind, and yet . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently it was time to go. By that time Dings</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happily established in a corner, sitting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor with her arms filled, and herself, indeed, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most part hidden by an unaccustomed wealth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">toys. She seemed careless of all human relation-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships as her parents receded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were forbidden to upset her by saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-bye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the door Elizabeth glanced back for the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and behold! Dings had dropped her new wealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was standing with a dubious face. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth gasped, and the motherly nurse pushed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and closed the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can come again soon, dear," she said, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected tenderness in her eyes. For a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth stared at her with a blank face. "You can</seg><seg type="columnLine">come again soon," repeated the nurse. Then with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a swift transition Elizabeth was weeping in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurse's arms. So it was that Denton's heart was</seg><seg type="columnLine">won also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And three weeks after our young people were</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely penniless, and only one way lay open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They must go to the Labor Company. So soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rent was a week overdue their few remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessions were seized, and with scant courtesy</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were shown the way out of the hotel. Eliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beth walked along the passage towards the staircase</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ascended to the motionless middle way, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulled by misery to think. Denton stopped behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to finish a stinging and unsatisfactory argument with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel porter, and then came hurrying after her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed and hot. TTe slackened his pace as lie over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">took her, and together they ascended to the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">way in silence. There they found two seats vacant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sat down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We need not go there--yet?" said Elizabeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--not till we are hungry," said Denton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They said no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth's eyes sought a resting-place and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">none. To the right roared the eastward ways, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the ways in the opposite direction, swarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">with people. Backwards and forwards along a cable</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead rushed a string of gesticulating meji,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed like clowns, each marked on back and chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one gigantic letter, so that altogether they spelt</seg><seg type="columnLine">out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Purkinje's Digestive Pills"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An anaemic little woman in horrible coarse blue can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vas pointed a little girl to one of this string of hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing advertisements.</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" said the anamiic woman: "ther's yer</seg><seg type="columnLine">father."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Which?" said the little girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Tm wiv his nose colored red." said the anaemic</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little girl began to cry, and Elizabeth could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have cried too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ain't 'e kickin' 'is legs!--just!'' said the anaemic</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman in blue, trying to make things bright again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Looky--now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the facade to the right a huge intensely bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">disc of weird color span incessantly, and letters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire that came and went spelt out--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Does this make you Giddy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a pause, followed by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Take a Purkinje's Digestive Pill."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A vast and desolating braying began.

The weather was kind to them, the seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sunlit and warm, and overhead the shining aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes went and came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last towards sunsetting their time was at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, and they made their vows to one another and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasped hands, and then rose up and went back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ways of the city, a shabby-looking, heavy-hearted</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair, tired and hungry. Soon they came to one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pale blue signs that marked a Labor Company</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bureau. For a space they stood in the middle way</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding this and at last descended and entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Labor Company had originally been a char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itable organization; its aim was to supply food,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter and work to all comers. This it was bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do by the conditions of its incorporation, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was also bound to supply food and shelter and medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal attendance to all incapable of work who chose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">demand its aid. In exchange these incapables paid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">labor notes, which they had to redeem upon recovery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They signed these labor notes with thumb-marks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were photographed and indexed in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way that this world-wide Labor Company could</seg><seg type="columnLine">identify any one of its two or three hundred million</seg><seg type="columnLine">clients at the cost of an hour's inquiry. The day's</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor was defined as two spells in a treadmill used</seg><seg type="columnLine">in generating electrical force, or its equivalent, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its due performance could be enforced by law. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice the Labor Company found it advisable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">add to its statutory obligations ol food and shelter a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few pence a day as an inducement to effort; and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">enterprise had not only abolished pauperization alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, but supplied practically all but the very high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est and most responsible labor throughout the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nearly a third of the population of the world were</seg><seg type="columnLine">its serfs and debtors from the cradle to the grave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this practical, unsentimental way the problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the unemployed had been most satisfactorily met</seg><seg type="columnLine">and overcome. No one starved in the public ways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no rags, no costume less sanitary and sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the Labor Company's hygienic but inelegant</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue canvas, pained the eye throughout the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. It was the constant theme of the phono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphic newspapers how much the world had pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressed since nineteenth-century days, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies of those killed by the vehicular traffic or dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of starvation were, they alleged, a common feature</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all the busier streets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton and Elizabeth sat apart in the waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">room until their turn came. Most of the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">collccted there seemed limp and taciturn, but three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four young people gaudily dressed made up for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quietude of their companions. They were life</seg><seg type="columnLine">clients of the Company, born in the Company's</seg><seg type="columnLine">creclie and destined to die in its hospital, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been out for a spree with some shillings or so of</seg><seg type="columnLine">extra pay. They talked vociferously in a later devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opment of the Cockney dialect, manifestly very</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud of themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth's eyes went from these to the less assert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ive figures. One seemed exceptionally pitiful to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. It was a woman of perhaps forty-five, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold-stained hair and a painted face, down which</seg><seg type="columnLine">abundant tears had trickled; she had a pinched nose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry eyes, lean hands and shoulders, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusty worn-out finery told the story of her life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another was a grey-bearded old man in the costume</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bishop of one of the high episcopal sects--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">religion was now also a business, and had its ups</seg><seg type="columnLine">and downs. And beside him a sickly, dissipated-look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing boy of perhaps two-and-twenty glared at Fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Elizabeth and then Denton interviewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manageress--for the Company preferred women</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this capacity--and found she possessed an ener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getic face, a contemptuous manner, and a particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly unpleasant voice. They were given various</seg><seg type="columnLine">checks, including one to certify that they need not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have their heads cropped; and when they had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">their thumb-marks, learnt the number corresponding</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereunto, and exchanged their shabby middle-class</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes for duly numbered blue canvas suits, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">repaired to the huge plain dining-room for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">first meal under these new conditions. Afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were to return to her for instructions about</seg><seg type="columnLine">their work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they had made the exchange of their cloth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Elizabeth did not seem able to look at Denton at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first; but he looked at her, and saw with astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that even in blue canvas she was still beautiful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And then their soup and bread came sliding on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">little rail down the long table towards them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped with a jerk, and he forgot the matter. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had had no proper meal for three days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After they had dined they rested for a time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither talked--there was nothing to say; and pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently they got up and went back to the manageress</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn what they had to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The manageress referred to a tablet. "Y'r rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't be here; it'll be in the Highbury Ward, ninety-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventh way, number two thousand and seventeen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Better make a note of it on y'r card.

One'd think these things didn't matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEIR ways to their work lay together for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. And now they found they could talk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Curiously enough, the worst of their depression</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed over now that they had actually donned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue. Denton could talk with interest even of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work that lay before them. "Whatever it is," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "it can't be so hateful as that hat shop. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">after we have paid for Dings we shall still have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole penny a day between us even now. After-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards--we may improve--get more money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth was less inclined to speech. "I wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">why work should seem so hateful," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's odd," said Denton. "I suppose it wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be if it were not the thought of being ordered about</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . I hope w^shall have decent managers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth did not answer. She was not thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that. She was tracing out some thoughts of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course." she said presently, "we have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">using up work all our lives. It's only fair--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stopped. It was too intricate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We paid for it." said Denton, for at that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not troubled himself about these complicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We did nothing--and yet we paid for it. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I cannot understand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps we are paying," said Elizabeth pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently--for her theology was old-fashioned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently it was time for them to part, and each</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the appointed work. Denton's was to mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">a complicated hydraulic press that seemed almost an</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent thing. This press worked by the sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">water that was destined finally to flush the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">drains--for the world had long since abandoned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">folly of pouring drinkable water into its sewers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This water was brought close to the eastward edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city by a huge canal, and then raised by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous battery of pupips into reservoirs at a level</seg><seg type="columnLine">of four hundred feet above the sea, from which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread by a billion arterial branches over the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thence it poured down, cleansing, sluicing, working</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery of all sorts, through an infinite variety</seg><seg type="columnLine">of capillary channels into the great drains, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cloacae maximae,* and so carried the sewage out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agricultural areas that surrounded London on</seg><seg type="columnLine">every side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The press was employed in one of the processes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the photographic manufacture, but the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the process it did not concern Denton to understand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The most salient fact to his mind was that it had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be conducted in ruby light, and as a consequence the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room in which he worked was lit by one colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe that poured a lurid and painful illumination</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the room. In the darkest corner stood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">press whose servant Denton had now become: it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge, dim. glittering thing with a projecting hood</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had a remote resemblance to a bowed head, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatting like some metal Buddha in this weird light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ministered to its needs, it seemed to Denton in</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain moods almost as if this must needs be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscure idol to which humanity in some strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">aberration had offered up his life. His duties had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a varied monotony. Such items as the following will</seg><seg type="columnLine">convey an idea of the service of the press. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing worked with a busy clicking so long as things</seg><seg type="columnLine">went well; but if the paste that came pouring through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeder from another room and which it was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petually compressing into thin plates, changed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality, the rhythm of its click altered and Denton</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened to make certain adjustments. The slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay involved a waste of paste and the docking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or more of his daily pence. If the supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paste waned--there were hand processes of a peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort involved in its preparation, and sometimes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers had convulsions which deranged their out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">put--Denton had to throw the press out of gear. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the painful vigilance a multitude of such trivial</seg><seg type="columnLine">attentions entailed, painful because of the incessant</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort its absence of natural interest required, Denton</seg><seg type="columnLine">had now to pass one-third of his days. Save for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional visit from the manager, a kindly but</seg><seg type="columnLine">singularly foul-mouthed man, Denton passed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">working hours in solitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth's work was of a more social sort. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fashion for covering the private apartments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the very wealthy with metal plates beautifully</seg><seg type="columnLine">embossed with repeated patterns. The taste of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time demanded, however, that the repetition of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patterns should not be exact--not mechanical, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">"natural"--and it was found that the most pleasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangement of pattern irregularity was obtained by</seg><seg type="columnLine">employing women of refinement and natural taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">to punch out the patterns with small dies. So many</seg><seg type="columnLine">square feet of plates was exacted from Elizabeth as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minimum, and for whatever square feet she did in</seg><seg type="columnLine">excess she received a small payment. The room, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">most rooms of women workers, was under fx man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ageress : men had been found by the Labor Company</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only less exacting but extremely liable to excuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">favored ladies from a proper share of their duties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The manageress was a not unkindly, taciturn person,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the hardened remains of beauty of the brunette</seg><seg type="columnLine">type; and the other women workers, who of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated her. associated her name scandalously with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the metal-work directors in order to explain her</seg><seg type="columnLine">position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only two or three of Elizabeth's fellovv-workers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were born labor serfs; plain, morose girls, but most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them corresponded to what the nineteenth century</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have called a "reduced" gentlewoman. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ideal of what constituted a gentlewoman had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •Principal or largest sewers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">altered: the faint, faded, negative virtue, the modu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated voice and restrained gesture of the old-fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned gentlewoman had vanished from the earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most of her companions showed in discolored hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined complexions, and the texture of their reminis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent conversations, the vanished glories of a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quering youth. All of these artistic workers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">much older than Elizabeth, and two openly expressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their surprise that any one so young and pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">should come to share their toil. But Elizabeth did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not trouble them with her old-world moral con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY were permitted, and even encouraged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">converse with each other, for the directors very</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly judged that anything that conduced to vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ations of mood made for pleasing fluctuations in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their patterning; and Elizabeth was almost forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear the stories of these lives with which her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">interwove: garbled and distorted they were by van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity indeed and yet comprehensible enough. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">soOn she began to appreciate the small spites and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliques, the little misunderstandings and alliances</seg><seg type="columnLine">that enmeshed about her. One woman was exces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sively garrulous and descriptive about a wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">son of hers; another had cultivated a foolish coarse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of speech, that she seemed to regard as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wittiest expression of originality conceivable; a third</seg><seg type="columnLine">mused for ever on dress, and whispered tojilizabeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">how she saved her pence day after day, JTnd would</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently have a glorious day of freedom, wearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . and then followed hours of description; two</seg><seg type="columnLine">others sat always together, and called one another</seg><seg type="columnLine">pet names, until one day some little thing happened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they sat apart, blind and deaf as it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another's being. And always from them all came</seg><seg type="columnLine">an incessant tap. tap, tap, tap, and the manageress</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened always to the rhythm to mark if one fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Tap, tap, tap, tap: so their days passed, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lives must pass. Elizabeth sat among them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindly and quiet, gray-hearted, marveling at Fate:</seg><seg type="columnLine">tap, tap, tap; tap, tap, tap; tap, tap, tap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So there came to Denton and Elizabeth a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">succession of laborious days, that hardened their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, wove strange threads of some new and sterner</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance into the soft prettiness of their lives,\nd</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew grave lines and shadows on their faces. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, convenient ways of the former life had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceded to an inaccessible distance; slowly they learnt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lesson of the under-world--sombre and labori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous, vast and pregnant. There were many little</seg><seg type="columnLine">things happened : things that would be tedious and</seg><seg type="columnLine">miserable to tell, things that were bitter and grievous</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bear--indignities, tyrannies, such as must ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">season the bread of the poor in cities; and one thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was not little, but seemed like the utter blacken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of life to them, which was that the child they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given life to sickened and died. But that story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ancient, perpetually recurring story, has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">told so often, has been told so beautifully, that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no need to tell it over again here. There was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same sharp fear, the same long anxiety, the deferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitable blow, and the black silence. It has always</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the same; it will always be the same. It is one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the things that must be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it was Elizabeth who was the first to speak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after an aching, dull interspace of days: not, indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the foolish little name that was a name no longer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but of the darkness that brooded over her soul. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come through the shrieking, tumultuous ways</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the city together; the clamor of trade, of yelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">competitive religions, of political appeal, had beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon deaf ears; the glare of focussed lights, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing letters, and fiery advertisements, had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the set, miserable faces unheeded. They took</seg><seg type="columnLine">their dinner in the dining-hall at a place apart. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want," said Elizabeth clumsily, "to go out to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying stages--to that seat. Here, one can say</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton looked at her. "It will be night." he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have asked,--it is a fine night." She stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He perceived she could find no words to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself. Suddenly he understood that she wished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the stars once more, the stars they had watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">together from the open downland in that wild honey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon of theirs five years ago. Something caught at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat. He looked away from her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There will be plenty of time to go," he said, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter-of-fact tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And at last they came out to their little seat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying stage, and sat there for a long time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. The little seat was in shadow, but the zenith</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pale blue with the effulgence of the stage over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and all the city spread below them, squares</seg><seg type="columnLine">and circles and patches of brilliance caught in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mesh-work of light. The little stars seemed very</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint and small: near as they had been to the old-</seg><seg type="columnLine">world watcher, they had become now infinitely re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mote. Yet one could see them in the darkened</seg><seg type="columnLine">patches amidst the glare, and especially in the north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward sky, the ancient constellations gliding steadfast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and patient about the pole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long our two people sat in silence, and at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth sighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I understood," she said, "if I could under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand. When one is down there the city seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything--the noise, the hurry, the voices--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must live, you must scramble. Here--it is nothing;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing that passes. One can think in peace."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," said Denton. "How flimsy it all is! From</seg><seg type="columnLine">here more than half of it is swallowed by the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">... It will pass."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall pass first," said Elizabeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," said Denton. "If life were not a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, the whole of history would seem like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">happening of a day ... Yes--we shall pass. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city will pass, and all the things that are to come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man and the Overman and wonders unspeakable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused, and then began afresh. "I know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you feel. At least I fancy ... Down there one thinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one's work, one's little vexations and pleasures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's eating and drinking and ease and pain. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives, and one must die. Down there and everyday</seg><seg type="columnLine">--our sorrow seemed the end of life. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up here it is different. For instance, down there</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would seem impossible almost to go on living if</seg><seg type="columnLine">one were horribly disfigured, horribly crippled, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graced. Up here--under these stars--none of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">things would matter. They don't matter. . . . They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a part of something. One seems just to touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">that something--under the stars. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped. The vague, impalpable things in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, cloudy emotions half shaped towards ideas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished before the rough grasp of words.

W. J. LUYTEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  of Harvard College Observatory, Cambridge, Mass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           It is with a feeling of gratification that we publish for the benefit of our readers, the interesting note</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       from Professor Luyten, pointing out the fallacy in the story, "TEN MILLION MILES SUNWARD." A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       force coming from the outside is essential to change the earth's orbit, and it will be observed that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       energy involved in a tremendous rapidity of flow of water into the Caspian Sea, or the discharge of some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       Inconceivably great projectile would bring to bear a force from the outside. We naturally cannot and do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       not wish to add anything to Professor Luyten's very clear and comprehensive statement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          In connection with the idea of discharging projectiles, we may refer to Jules Vern's story, "The Pur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       chase of the North Pole," in our issues of September and October, 1926. Here, in order to shift the North</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       Pole, Jules Verne's scientists discharge an enormous projectile into space, in exact accordance with Pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       fessor Luyten's statement. Jules Verne' in his story, however, assumed that the people of his tale merely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       desired to shift the North Pole toward the Temperate Zone, and not to divert the earth from its orbir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTRONOMICALLY speaking, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing is totally unsound; it is en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely impossible to change the course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth (I mean in its path around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun) by doing anything from the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself. To change the earth's orbit would</seg><seg type="columnLine">require a force coining from the outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the most, we could do a little toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">it by breaking the earth in two, then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two bits might very well pursue another</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit. The fundamental law of mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ics is that the centre of gravity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth will remain in its orbit so long; as</seg><seg type="columnLine">only interior forces act, and in the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Caspian adventure we are dealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a purely interior force. Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shifting of the centre of gravity on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its account would he very small.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the water flowed from the Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sea into the Caspian at a tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of speed, it might for the time being</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow down the rotation of the earth a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little and make the day a few seconds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">longer, but would have no further effect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After the Caspian had been filled up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotation would come back to practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same value it had before. Also, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a case, if the earth swerved at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its course, it would do that gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, and not suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If we were really in the predicament</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed by the author of "Ten Million</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miles Sunward" our only salvation would</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie in shooting off enormous projectiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction opposite to the way we</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to go. This is essentially a force</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Concerning the Black Sea-Caspian con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection it might he of interest to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there is a canal between the rivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don and Volga, thereby connecting these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two seas. At least so I was told when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in Russia last summer. I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">think however that the thing is 011 any</seg><seg type="columnLine">large scale and probably too high up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill the Caspian with Black Sea water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ yeast men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hyD&amp;Oid H.

Since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last war, Moronia has perfected some kind of a light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray. A machine is placed every mile along their en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire border. From these machines the rays go out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">presumably in a fan shape. When the ray'strikes an</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane, the engine not only stops but apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">explodes.

So far, twenty of our planes, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guised as commercial machines, have been destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and our aviators killed. In every instance the bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">were brought to the frontier by the Moronians. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each time they have simply explained that something</seg><seg type="columnLine">went wrong with the machinery and the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped in their country. We have every reason to</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that they have perfected some power which</seg><seg type="columnLine">will render impossible any attack on the enemy by</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.

Said Von Dort, "A country that thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">rewards honesty is a land rotten to the core." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">men around the table kept an awkward silence as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Premier Plautz stood up. "You gentlemen know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to do. I will accept no excuses for incompe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tency. Moronia must be destroyed. We will meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">again a week from today. The Secret Service had</seg><seg type="columnLine">better follow Von Dort and imprison him. I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust him. Keep him in solitary confinement and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will deal finally with him in a few days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Von Dort, however, was already in his automobile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving Eupenia as fast as he could. He paused at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his home only long enough to almost throw his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and baby and a few valuables into his car; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started for Moronia at seventy miles an hour. Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dort was thoroughly mad. For ten years he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">served in the air service of Eupenia, advancing slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from mechanician to Chief of the Service. During</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time he had done his best. Under his leadership</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corps had achieved the finest type of morale. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that his men were always ready to gamble on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance in war, but he could not sit still and see his</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire force sent to what he felt was certain death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During his ten years of military service he had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample chance to study the Premier. He knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">every man who had dared to oppose Plautz had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an unfortunate end, disgrace, exile or death. Life</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Von Dort. with his wife and baby was too sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sacrificed unless absolutely necessary. The for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer Chief of the Air Service fully realized all this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He increased the speed of his car. Moronia was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">destination for other reasons than because it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest border. He felt that he could trust them, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies, more than he could trust the other nation?</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were friendly to Eupenia. Also, his wife had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from that nation. She was the daughter of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">former Moronian general, who died in the last wrar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Von Dort had been a mem!&gt;er of the army of occupa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and once having met this particular young lady,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his loyalty to Eupenia was insufficient to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from falling in love. He felt that if he had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">die, it would be better to die with his wife and baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mountains of Moronia, than in solitude in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eupenian prison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE radio message beat them to the frontier, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Von Dort saw that the barricade had been low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered. It was a sturdy wooden gate, but the automo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bile hit it going eighty miles an hour and reduced it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kindling. The car finally stopped, rather dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heveled in looks but with the motor still running, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile inside Moronia. There Von Dort stopped as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as possible, having a deep respect for the vigi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lance and accurate shooting of the Moronia border</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrol. He did not wish to arouse their suspicion in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any way. The car was soon surrounded by cavalry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, who politely but firmly asked for full details as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his identity and reason for entering the country in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a precipitous manner. Realizing that there w'as</seg><seg type="columnLine">no reason for deceit, he gave them a brief account of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trouble and asked to be taken to the General-in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief of the Moronian army.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moronia, nominally a monarchy, was in every re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spect democratic, except that it had a King. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizen felt an equal amount of reverence and fra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ternity for this monarch. There was rank, both in</seg><seg type="columnLine">civil and military life, but promotion was by merit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without either syncophancy or tyranny. Conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently it was easier to see the Commanding Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral in Moronia than it was to see the Third Assist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant Secretary of Agriculture in Eupenia. The Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ronians lived among the mountains, and like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagles of the crags, prized their liberty. In conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quence of all this it was only a few hours before Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dort was telling his story to General Androvitz and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his staff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They believed all that he said. Especially did they</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe him after his wife talked to them in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">native patois. There were some present who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known her father well. One old officer was even able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remember the celebration of her christening. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">general discussion was finally ended by Von Dort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I fled because I knew that Premier Plautz in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to have me killed, and I came here because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife and because I felt keenly the injustice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another war. Moronia is to lie destroyed for no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other reason than selfishness and greed. The force</seg><seg type="columnLine">against you is overwhelming.

I am sorry that it all has to end</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus, hut we have done our best. One more inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion like our ultra-light rays would have saved us--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but our scientists have done their best, and as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have failed, so have they. Colonel Von Dort, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust your honesty and welcome you to our ranks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your desire to die on the field of battle will probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">be realized."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The meeting was just breaking up, each participant</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to carry the sad news to his friends, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard at the door announced the presence of Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings, one of Monrovia's staff of scientific investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor Billings," said the King, "a harmless fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">from America. He has worked in our laboratory for</seg><seg type="columnLine">years without pay except for his bare expenses, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is about broken-hearted because so far he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to make any discovery of importance. I wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could get him back to America before war begins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let us humor the old gentleman and listen to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">story. I want you to show his age the proper respect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let there be no levity. His loyalty and faithful en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavor demand our greatest courtesy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings came in and was seated by the King. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stooped-shouldered, bald and trembling. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-pitched voice cracked like 'static under his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your Majesty and Gentlemen," he said. "After</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of the most tedious experimentation, I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally discovered a method of defending ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the Eupenians."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine!" said the King. "Now tell us all about it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I propose that we make an army of Yeast Men."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is a fine idea, Mr. Billings," said the King</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothingly. "I am sure that your discovery has</seg><seg type="columnLine">merit. Now I want you to go over to America and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a long vacation, and after you are thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested you can come back and visit us again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you do not understand," pleaded the old man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I suppose you think that I am senile. The inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is complete and I am sure it will work. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical and simple. The one machine I have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">functions perfectly. It can easily be duplicated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone can run it. All we need is an abundance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yeast and hundreds of machines. You shoot the lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle fellows out like bullets from a machine gun."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, what happens then?" asked General Andro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitz.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They just grow and walk around a little and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If they do that they will be typical soldiers," in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrupted the Chief of the Artillery Service. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is about all we will do between now and Christmas."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But in dying they will win the victory!" eagerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">chirped the inventor in his high-pitched cricket</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice." Cannot you understand that they will die</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rot in Eupenia?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The King gently took the old man by the shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as he talked the tears came to his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       Y dear Billings. The thing you describe is</seg><seg type="columnLine">lVl just a soldier. For hundreds of years the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moronians have died in defense of their country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had died and rotted, and yet we, as a nation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have slowly withered away. Brave men by the thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand have done just that, and to what avail? Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerness to help has worried you sick. Go and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long rest. Yeast Men and real men may die and rot</seg><seg type="columnLine">but our dear Moronia is doomed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But cannot you see it?" pleaded the inventor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh! Please try to see it. Yeast Men by the mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions and billions walking into Eupenia and rotting</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Cannot you see how it is going to work ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I beg your pardon," asked General Androvitz,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"but did you say billions?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I did. A few drops of yeast grows to be a soldier</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">six feet tall. Give me as many machines as those you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">made to generate the anti-aircraft rays and I will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">produce Yeast Men by the million. I will make a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">million every day as long as it is necessary."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And they live just so long and then die?" asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the King.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, they live about three days. During that time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they are able to move about twenty-five miles. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they die and rot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"A fairy tale," said the Premier, who, up to this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time, had kept silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But I can prove it. I have made one. If you see</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">just one of them, will you believe it? Let me show</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you just one!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The King held up his hand for silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Gentlemen, let me talk to Billings. Please do not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">interrupt. He is nervous--and so am I. We must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">get to the real truth in this matter. I would never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forgive myself if he really found something of value</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and lost it because of our incredulity. Now, Friend</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Billings, let us pretend that we are alone. Pay no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attention to these other men. Listen to my questions,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and answer them as simply as you can. Remember</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that I am not a scientist and do not understand big</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">words. Now, how much yeast does it take to make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a soldier?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"About two drops."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How big does he grow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"About six feet tall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Do they look like real men ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Just a little. You see they are made of dough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Do they walk as we do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No. It is sort of a creeping shuffle--amoeba</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">movement."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"If they are not destroyed, how long will they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">live ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"About three days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What happens then ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"They cease to grow or move. They die and de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cay--rot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Suppose one of them is shot or has his head cut</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">off with a saber, or is torn into pieces by a cannon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ball, what then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Each piece would keep on living and growing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and moving till the end of the third day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You said they would move at eight miles an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hour?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, if nothing stopped them. They would be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in Eupenia at the end of forty-eight hours, and by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">end of the third day they would rot there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Are you sure of all this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It worked out in the laboratory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What makes them grow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It is a peculiar form of yeast.

Just as soon as it is liberated, it be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gins to extract nitrogen from the air, and expands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It not only expands, but it actually grows by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rapid division of the yeast cells."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I do not understand it," said the King, "but I am</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">willing to take your word for it.

No soldier was checked just</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a smell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But this will stop them. I have a little bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. It has one drop of the end slime diluted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand times.

Roughly, the soldier took two deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">smells. Then Billings corked the bottle, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">volunteer slumped from the chair down to the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay there, white, sweating and vomiting. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">others hastened to help him loosen his collar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" exclaimed the King. "Just two whiffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a bottle containing a thousandth of a drop, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each dead Yeast Man produces thirty pounds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff. Will it kill ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not men, but plants," was Billing's reply. "Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this." He emptied the bottle on a large clay jar</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding a blooming cyclamen. At once the plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">withered and died. A curious foetid smell filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. The King rose hastily and sought an opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. So did the rest seek doors and open win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows. while carrying the fainting Chief of the Artil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lery Service with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as they got outside the room, in the pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, the King turned to the inventor:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Show me just one man like those you describe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Billings--just one man, and the resources of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kingdom are at your command."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have made them.

You see. they go</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a straight line unless they are led, and the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">way we could keep him under observation was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead him around in a track."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will go and see him." said the King, "and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will take with us the Professor of Mathematics from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the University. Gentlemen, follow us in your cars.'*</seg><seg type="columnLine">The party reassembled at an old race track, over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown with grass and a quarter mile in circumfer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. Slowly walking around this track was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistant from the Morovian laboratories. Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were resting on a bench. The walking man held</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rope and was leading by it a peculiar creature. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an Yeast Man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IMAGINE a six-foot man of dough, with a crust</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard enough to hold it erect, yet viscid enough to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">allow it to move forward. A creature with a head</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no face, with spade-like hands without fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and instead of two legs and feet, simply--simply a</seg><seg type="columnLine">body like a skirt, which rested firmly on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a two-foot base. It was the convulsive movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this base and the mass of fermenting yeast above</seg><seg type="columnLine">it that in some way enabled it to move slowly over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. It was such a creature, with a broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas band around its waist, that the Morovians saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">being led around the track. Mr. Billings ran for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward eagerly and conferred with his men. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to the group of officers surrounding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">King.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They report that it had gone around the track</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety-nine times. That is twenty-three miles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly twenty-four. It was four feet tall at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the first day and at the end of the second day it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was full grown. It is now nearly three days old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if our calculations are correct, it will soon die."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Yeast Man slowly moved around the track.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just in front of the tumbled-down grandstand it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. Billings instructed his men to take off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas belt. The party gathered around the motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less figure. Suddenly it began to grow shorter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stouter. It swayed, and finally out of balance, started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fall forward, bending at the waist. An unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor filled the air. Suddenly it bent double, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally melted into a pool of greenish yellow slime.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The odor grew increasingly frightful, so that it drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the observers further and yet further away. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass touched by the slime withered and died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The King turned to the professor of mathematics.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Professor," he said, "estimate the size of that pud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle. Multiply it by five billion. Estimate the terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory filled with that odor. Suppose sw'h masses, five</seg><seg type="columnLine">billion such masses, were scattered equally over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eupenia. What would be the result ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor figured on the back of an old en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velope. He used the stub of a short pencil which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously stuck in his mouth after every fifth figure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally he said, "If you could arrange to have them</seg><seg type="columnLine">die at different places, the whole of Eupenia would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be covered about six inches deep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The King turned to his staff:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am satisfied, gentlemen. We will have hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of these machines made, and when we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to begin operations, Mr. Billings can make</seg><seg type="columnLine">five thousand Yeast Men to start with. Our citizens</seg><seg type="columnLine">can lead them for three days, and just as they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to die, we will turn them loose on all the high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways and open spaces leading to Eupenia. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time, we will start making them by the million.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our attack will come before the enemy's ready. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">it works, we will obtain a bloodless victory. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">way we can make a success of it is to spring it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as a total surprise. Cut all the wires leading to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eupenia. Confiscate at once all the radio sets. Be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more careful than ever in watching the suspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">spies. It would not be a bad idea to imprison them</seg><seg type="columnLine">till this is over. Put a triple guard on the border.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Permit no intercommunication.

At the same time do not omit a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">item leading to the preparedness of our little army.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I understood Von Dort to say that we would be at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked on the first of October.

May</seg><seg type="columnLine">God save our Country and bless our good friend, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings. Now, Gentlemen, to work, day and night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without rest, to make this machinery, gather an</seg><seg type="columnLine">abundance of material and train men to use the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEAR every road connecting the two coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tries, large canvas camouflage screens were</seg><seg type="columnLine">erected. Captive observation balloons sent up by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eupenian air service reported no massing of Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ronian troops. Behind these canvas screens, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, thousands of the men and women of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain kingdom took turns leading five thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yeast Men in their monotonous journey toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. All day and all night on the 17th, 18th and</seg><seg type="columnLine">19th of September, these five thousand Yeast Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved and grew behind the protecting curtains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their genesis had been so timed that at dusk on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third day they were two days, twenty-three hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thirty minutes old. Then they were turned loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the main highways and were started on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow shuffle toward Eupenia. Some, of course, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked at the border barricades. Others crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">around or over and had advanced several hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards into the enemy's country before dissolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime peculiar-looking machine guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being placed at intervals of one mile, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">manned by a group of trained Moronian soldiers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These guns were simple in construction, and mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on sturdy tripods. Above each was a small hopper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which yeast was fed to a small but powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">press operated by condensed air. Each blow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ram produced a Yeast Man one-eighth of an inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">high. These were dropped into the barrel of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun and were blown out into the air several hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet away from the gun. Like thistle down they</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated, gradually dropping to the ground, base down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and head erect. Immediately on touching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, they began their peculiar shuffling movement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was to continue in the exact direction in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had started. As the guns worked, they revolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly through a forty-five degree horizontal arc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each gun fired two Yeast Men a second. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant one hundred and twenty a minute; seven thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. two hundred an hour, or 172,800 in the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twenty-four hours. There were seven hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns made, but only about five hundred were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual use at any one time; the others acting as re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placements. Counting the total time these five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred guns were in use, it was later estimated that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were fired about ten days. This made a total</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 1.728.000 for each gun, or a grand total of eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and sixty-four million Yeast Men manufac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured during the campaign.

It will be remembered that this slime,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a one-to-a-thousand dilution, was sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong to produce disabling vomiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These guns began operations twenty-four hours</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">before the five thousand fully-grown Yeast Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were liberated. They then moved slowly forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and behind them came successive waves of smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet smaller men of dough. At the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first twenty-four hours, the oldest of the Yeast Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been shot from the five hundred guns, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly four feet high. The woods and fields of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eupenia bordering on Moronia were dotted with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar creatures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The statement made by Mr. Billings that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to manufacture them by the billions never</seg><seg type="columnLine">materialized. The machines worked more slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he had anticipated. It was also seen that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large number were caught in trees and ravines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unable to continue their march. Yet a sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">number reached the smooth highways and level pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures to do everything that was required of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also the work was facilitated later in the campaign</seg><seg type="columnLine">by mounting the guns in airplanes and literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">showering the towns and cities with the little fellows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, however, was not attempted till it was seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the morale of the Eupenians was completely de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the entire campaign not a single Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ronian died of injuries incident to warfare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though time and again many of them fell exhausted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from lack of sleep. The radium workers not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">received painful burns but were affected for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">years as the result of the prolonged exposure to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious emanations from the weird element.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These, however, were but slight horrors of war com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared with what might have happened had the Eu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penian attack found the Moronians in their previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">defenseless condition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  During September. 1930, all had been active in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kingdom dominated by Premier Plautz, who was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">real ruler of Eupenia, in place of the feeble-minded</seg><seg type="columnLine">King. All branches of the army, including the avia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion section, had been mobilized. Fifty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained and well-armed men were in camp ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin the destruction of the little mountainous king-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom of Moronia. The attack was timed to begin on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first of October. Premier Plautz no longer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">content with his usual statement that Moronia must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be destroyed. He was now saying that the time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, for the actual work of destruction to begin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An interesting fact was that the escape of Col.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Von Dort and his admission into Moronia as a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of refuge was to be made the actual causa belli. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thirtieth of September his surrender was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded within twenty-four hours. If it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not conceded, the Eupenian army would at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance. If the demand were complied with, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">army would advance anyway. Moronia, as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Premier Plautz was concerned, had to be destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A broad highway connected the capital cities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two kingdoms. This was the road used by Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dort in his dramatic flight for safety. It was here</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the border that he had crashed through the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ricade. At this point, the Eupenian border guard*</seg><seg type="columnLine">was commanded by Lieutenant Kraut, and under</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was a company of ninety privates and non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">commissioned officers. On the evening of the nine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teenth of September, the Lieutenant was writing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">daily report and wishing for something to happen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieve the deadly monotony of daily routine. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had finished this report and was signing it, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentry rushed in and stated that a number of pecul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">iar looking naked men were at the boundary gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to enter the country. Suspecting a trap, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant at once called his entire force to arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and personally investigated the matter. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached the barricade, he was astonished to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of grayish white creatures, six feet high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving aimlessly on the other side of the gate. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heads without features, bodies without legs, arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">without fingers. Cautiously, he touched one and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivered at the peculiar soft sensation that was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted by the animal's skin. Realizing that his men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were watching him closely and that any sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervousness on his part would be communicated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and feeling certain, too, that each of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar shapes was but a mask and cloak for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moronian soldier, he drew his revolver and shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the odd things several times through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart section. The bullet holes closed ancTuiere was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no blood. The thing kept on with its curious shuf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Attention, men," he commanded. "Open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gates and we will take them all prisoners. God</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows what they are. but they cannot hurt us any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and we will hold them till to-morrow and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">send them in trucks to the General-in-Chief."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His men obeyed the command but there were many</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the new creatures than there were soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus while over seventy were captured, several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred passed the barricade and started moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the guard-house the telephone was ringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently. Headquarters wanted to know if any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing new had developed and whether Lieut. Kraut</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his command were safe. Disquieting messages</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being received from the other outposts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they wanted an immediate report. Lieut. Kraut</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to tell about the peculiar things he had cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured, and the Major at the other end of the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">reprimanded him for being drunk again. The Lieu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenant protested that he was perfectly sober. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Major demanded an exact description of the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal. The Lieutenant had one brought into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">office and held near his desk while he gave a verbal</seg><seg type="columnLine">description over the telephone. Even while he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking, the animal softened and started to melt. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant described the process as long as he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk. Even while writhing 011 the floor in deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">nausea and vomiting, he tried to tell what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. but his retching only convinced the Major</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Headquarters that the Lieutenant was beastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk. Finally the Lieutenant was dragged out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office by two of his men, who waded through</seg><seg type="columnLine">pools of indescribable filth to rescue him. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too sick to realize that his entire command had fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Post, though here and there one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers lay on the road too sick to move. Outside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road was impassable on account of the puddles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of slime which dotted it. Cursing and vomiting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Lieutenant staggered through the dark woods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking pure air and freedom from the stench, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in memory produced a recurrence of the pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trating nausea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime those of the novel creatures who still</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived were shuffling slowly down the broad highway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every few minutes losing one of their number by</seg><seg type="columnLine">death and decay. In the dark hours of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">they died unseen and unmourned, but each of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">left behind a horrible evidence that they had once</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived. Over the pools of slime others of their kind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">walked, some three feet high, others a foot high and</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there could be seen midgets only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches high but resembling their larger brothers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every detail. When the sun rose, there also arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from every road between the two kingdoms, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell of death a million times magnified. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though Moronia were surrounded by a circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">decay three miles deep. Meantime the smaller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger Yeast Men were advancing into Eupenia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the woods and meadows, tumbling into</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravines, catching fast in trees and bushes, falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">into streams and being swept away in the current,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet ever with a sound like soft snow falling, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little ones, new born, were floating down through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air like goose down, and on and on the machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the border of Moronia kept up their gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">thump-thump-thump and with each thump was cre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated one more new life, one more soldier, brainless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearless, bloodless, filled with the urge to keep on</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving till dissolution came. And they all moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">downhill, from the mountainous Moronia, into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies' more level country. They were perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the Eupenian out-posts had experienced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same novel sensations and made the same report that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was made by Lieutenant Kraut as soon as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to talk. None of the officers who came to head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters to report could produce any proof that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they really had seen such massive monstrosities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every officer had to periodically stop his verbal re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port till another period of vomiting had passed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commander-in-Chief thoroughly believed that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone drunk and insane through the effects of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheap whiskey and put them all under arrest. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time he sent several spies on motor-cycles</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a thorough investigation. These returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">babbling hysterically of an army of creatures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sizes, and every spy was vomiting with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiastic persistency that the officers had shown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Commander-in-Chief began to curse the morals</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his army and went and started to get "drunk"</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even then Eupenia might have saved herself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it is a question as to just how efficacious any</seg><seg type="columnLine">campaign of shrapnel, or any building of fences or</seg><seg type="columnLine">digging of ditches, would have proved. W'hat really</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened was no doubt inevitable, yet the fact re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains, and it is of historical importance, that twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours passed before any offensive was started.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Data was gathered and observations and lengthy re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports were made. Otherwise nothing was done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These reports, especially from the border regions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of such a varied and fantastic nature that little</seg><seg type="columnLine">value could be placed on them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FINALLY Premier Plautz decided to personally</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigate the situation. He took with him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief-of-Staff and a group of scientists from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">University. They found the new creatures by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of thousands and of all sizes. They also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came as near as they could to several of the puddles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of end-slime. An effort to observe these carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the aid of gas masks was useless. Even when</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the foetid material was gathered at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a long pole, it could not be brought close enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make any observations of value. Several of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things were carefully studied, both chemically and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anatomically, but not a single observer connected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving oddities with the pools of decay. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE YEAST MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be remembered that after the first hour of the offen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive no more Yeast Men had died, and the reports</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rapid dissolution of the first wave were en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely discredited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For the first time in his life, Premier Plautz was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a loss to know what to do. To him the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation was incomprehensible. At one side of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobile a five foot abortion was slowly moving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its featureless face asking only one question. "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">was I made?" In the Premier's hand was a watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystal and on the glass was a new creation, barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter of an inch high, in every respect the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">duplicate of its brother standing by the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car.	X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does this mean, Professor Owens?" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled Premier asked the Chemistry teacher.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What kind of things are these? They cannot fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have no weapons, no brains, no blood. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">they know is how to grow and move forward. Evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently they come from Moronia, but for what reason.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is it a declaration of war?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old Professor answered to the best of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability and what he said was surprisingly near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are just Yeast Men, Your Excellency. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have examined them in every way, chemically and</seg><seg type="columnLine">microscopically and they are just peculiarly shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of dough animated by some very active</seg><seg type="columnLine">yeast. Their movements resemble dough overflow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a pan. 1 do not know what they mean but I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what they are. I have had one cut up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">baked in loaves and it tastes like a fairly good kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whole wheat bread."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Here the Chief-of-Staff interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Of course we could consider it as a declaration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of war and attack, but what would be the influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the world's opinion of us? Reporters would</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush in from the Paris and London papers. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make us a laughing stock of the universe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What could we say? That we were afraid of lumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yeast? That wc were using our artillery on po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tential loaves of bread? So far, these creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not committed a single deprivation. No lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been lost, not a house burned, not a single pig</seg><seg type="columnLine">or chicken killed. Think what a reporter from an</seg><seg type="columnLine">American paper would do to us if he had a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to write it up? How he would describe our infantry</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring bullets into dough, our brave cavalry men</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting the heads off of bread men? Far better</seg><seg type="columnLine">would it be to take them as fast as we can and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribute them among all of our people and let them</seg><seg type="columnLine">make bread with them. That would be a joke.

All that afternoon and evening thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of Yeast Men were brought into the towns</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cities of Eupenia in private automobiles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">army trucks. The Premier, quick to act for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal advantage issued an order canceling all</seg><seg type="columnLine">contracts for'flour and directing that the army be</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplied with bread baked from the dough creatures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each company in the army was directed to forage</seg><seg type="columnLine">for its own supply and to keep them in their tents</seg><seg type="columnLine">till they were needed for baking bread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning, which was the beginning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third day of the Moronian offensive, thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Yeast Men were exhibited in parade through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets of the Eupenian capital, each one in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of a soldier. The citizens laughed till they</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried at the comical spectacle, and slapped each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the back as they pointed out "the only kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers Moronia could attack with." Within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours it became quite the fashion to have your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">jiersonal Yeast Man. Children walked around lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their little dough pets. High School pupils</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted theirs with the class colors and numerals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These things could be led and guided. Herr Schmidt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Honorable President of the Ancient Order of Eu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penian Cab Drivers, made a harness for a pair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had them draw a light buggy through the streets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his grandson for driver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That third day was a fete day for all Eupenia.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Premier, however, had gone to unnecessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor to bring the Yeast Men into the city.

Instead of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">a joke, this thing w'as becoming a problem. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gathered into the parks, thrown into the cellars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">herded out into the country, but still they came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing numbers.

Not all at once, but in increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers. And twilight advanced to add darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the horror.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad enough in the country districts where here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there the pools of end-slime dotted the woods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meadows; but in the cities, especially in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capital, the immediate result was a panic.

The houses were filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. The streets were filled with it. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">living things that were unaffected were the Yeast</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men waiting for their turn to die.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">infantry could build fires and burn them.

It traveled on all</seg><seg type="columnLine">fours, but its hind limbs were four times as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forelegs, so that its nose almost touched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. It stood sixteen feet high at the thighs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was covered with hard, bony, plates, except on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">underbody, forming an impenetrable armor. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of the head, over the back, and halfway</seg><seg type="columnLine">down its tail, was a succession of bony plates in</seg><seg type="columnLine">double columns, and varying in height from a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of inches to three feet, each razor-sharp at the edges,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and coming to a sharp point at the top. The head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very small, and triangular in shape, with small</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, and a mouth that cleft back past its eyes. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous tail was its one means of offense or de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense. Enormous at the base, (fully ten feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter,) it tapered gradually for its whole length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twenty-five feet, and ended in a very blunt tip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where the bony, finlike, plates had ended in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the tail, a series of four pairs of extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp, conical, spikes, of about two feet in length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began. When the stegosaurus lashed out with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiked tail, it would produce the same result, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hit a person with a board through which a series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nails had been driven.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, then, was the monster upon which the flesh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating tyrannosaurus looked. Ordinarily, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of other, and more easily conquered game,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have passed the stegosaurus by, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Plated Lizard" was regarded by the other dinosaurs</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same way as the present animals regard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">porcupine. But Cayna was in no mood to pass any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing by with which he might do battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So. with a mighty roar, he charged the armored</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinosaur, lashing out at the other's head with one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his smaller forelegs. But the stegosaurus had antici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pated the movement, and had drawn its head inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">its armor, like a mud-turtle, and the blow only</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraped the impenetrable plates on its neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus they jockeyed around for some moments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tyrannosaurus always being careful to keep at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other's head end, out of reach of the destroying</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail, and the stegosaurus endeavoring to wheel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike a bone-crushing blow with his spiked</seg><seg type="columnLine">appendage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the old king had not survived many fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">battles by sheer luck. He resorted to strategy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Striking a slow, hesitating blow toward the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealed head, he induced the sluggish giant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike at it. This it did, and when its head was fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, the wily monarch lashed out. carrying away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right side, and one eye, of the "plated dinosaur's"</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Screaming in amazement, the great stegosaurus</seg><seg type="columnLine">reared up on its hind legs. It was the opening for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Cayna had been waiting. Leaping forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sized the other's neck with both forepaws.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, supporting himself with his tail, he swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">disemboweled the other with his immense hind legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The great tail of the stegosaurus lashed convulsively</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few seconds, then was still, and the flesh-eater</seg><seg type="columnLine">dined well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAVING satisfied his hunger, but not his blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">lust, Cayna went forth again, until he arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a rather small plain. Nearby, alongside a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder, was a huge bull triceratops, snorting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pawing the earth savagely. He was evidently an</seg><seg type="columnLine">outcast from a vast herd which could 1)e seen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance, stretching as far as eye could reach, count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less thousands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The triceratops was about eleven feet tall at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thigh, where, like the stegosaurus, he was the tall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est. However, his forelegs were not nearly so short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in comparison to the hind legs, as were the stego-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saurus'. He was, also like the stegosaurus, covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hard bony plates or knobs, which served him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as armor. He also possessed a bony frill about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, which gave him the appearance of a Roman</seg><seg type="columnLine">gladiator. He had, characteristic of a dinosaur,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great tail, enormous at the base, and tapering-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradual ly. Three horns and a parrot-like beak com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletes his description. One horn over the nose, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a foot and a half in length, and the other two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one over each eye, four or five feet in length. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">all three were of needle-like sharpness. A monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy of the gigantic Cayna's best efforts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charging, with a roar, out into the open, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tyrannosaurus leaped upon the "three-horns" back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavoring to sink his giant fangs through the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrable armor. But his efforts were unavailing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The triceratops, with an impatient shake of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty frame, hurled the tyrannosaurus from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">insecure hold, up against the great boulder. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling rapidly, it sank its shorter nose-horn its</seg><seg type="columnLine">full length into the tyrannosaurus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old monarch, in desperation, seized the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">two great horns of the triceratops in his smaller fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paws, and forcing the great head down, thus origi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated a hold which rendered the other helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The triceratops, bellowing insanely, continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gore and slit the tyrannosaurus' flesh to ribbons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his nose horn and parrot-like beak, but was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to inflict a fatal wound. But in spite of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible punishment, the tyrannosaurus continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">force the great head downward; and finally it touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. Then, screaming in triumph, he sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">his great fangs into the now unprotected neck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crunching it until he severed the spinal column, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horned giant fell dead at his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the old king had not escaped unscathed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was bleeding from a score of wounds, so, 110</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner was_ his adversary dead, than he hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to a little pool he knew of, to lick and bathe</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wounds. He was chastened in body, but not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit, and his two previous battles had only caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flame of his blood lust to burn more brightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After perhaps an hour of bathing and licking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds, Cayna ventured forth once more, coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally to a pebbled beach by the great sea water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found a gigantic brontosaurus basking at full</seg><seg type="columnLine">length upon it. Of all the colossal dinosaurs, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were none so huge as the brontosaurus, excepting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diplodoeus, a creature greatly resembling him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A great monster, about seventy-five feet long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing sixteen feet at the thigh'(where, a char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acteristic of a dinosaur, it stood the tallest), and</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighing nearly forty tons.

It had an abnormally long</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, with a head at the end so small that it looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a mere continuation of the neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, then, was the creature upon which Cayna</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged forth, and leaping upon the mountainous</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, buried his great fangs in the thick rolls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh at the base of the neck, and ground steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward in a search for the spinal column.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The monster, at the first attack, had leaped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming shrilly, into the air, for all its great</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight. It bit, ineffectually, at the tyrannosaurus'</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy hide, with its small, frail teeth, and lashed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with its heavy tail. The last, however, was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely ineffectual.

Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty-five years later, a submarine, almost exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the one his vivid and prophetic mind conceived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerges from a German harbor and travels under</seg><seg type="columnLine">its own power over a distance of 4,(XX) miles, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the North Sea, the English Channel, down the At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantic, through the entire length of the Mediterranean</seg><seg type="columnLine">and up through the Dardanelles to Constantinople!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And by way of diversion it manages to sink several</seg><seg type="columnLine">battleships of the enemy by means of its torpedoes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, bold as he was, Jules Verne never conceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an "impossible thing," and while his famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nautilus was equipped with almost every other</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern submarine necessity, the infernal atitomobile-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpedo was missing.

No doubt you thought I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been killed by a meteor last night. Well, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">Americans put it, 1 certainly had 'a close shave.' A</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor crashed down on my aerial 50 feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">where 1 was sitting; of course it went up in smoke--</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic vapor, to be correct--due to the tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat generated by the impact of the meteor on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">granite rocks. The meteor went up in a fiery cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of red vapor and I was blown headlong a distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of over 50 feet, right down into the mouth of a giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater, by the resulting blast of the concussion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This long-extinct crater is a very deep one; how</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep, I was soon to learn! I went down head first</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kept on falling down that abyss at a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of speed, for what seemed to be hours. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept on plunging down, I was gloomily reflecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">what an inglorious end it was. to die at the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unromantic crater on a dead and dried-up moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought of many things, when I suddenly became</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious of a frightful cold. Call it instinct or pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of mind, or what you will, but, as soon as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had started on my downward journey, I had jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">my body in such a manner as to righten it; in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, after a few attempts, I succeeded in falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet down. It was indeed a fortunate circumstance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the sun was almost directly over the crater, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it saved me the anguish of plunging into a pitch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">black abyss. While it was not nearly as light as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the top, still I could see where I was falling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was some consolation. Thus, when I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">down toward mv feet after a while, I am sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart, which had lost some beats, stood still en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely. It took me a few seconds to collect my be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered senses, for this is what I saw:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The crater had no bottom at all: it went right</seg><seg type="columnLine">through to the center of the moon, where it con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected with another crater, which went to the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite side. I knew this must be so because when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down I saw several stars shining through</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliantly from the night side of the moon. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the awful truth flashed through me and I almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooned. I was falling through the whole diameter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the moon! I had been in many tight quarters be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, during my somewhat exciting career, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience indeed bade well to be the inglorious end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my adventurous life. However, my far-famed</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of mind and my cool head soon asserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, as was naturally to be expected of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew the diameter of the moon to be 2,164</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles. A quick mental calculation proved that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take my falling body about 24 minutes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the center of the moon. As there was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop my fall. I must naturally continue to fall, due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the tremendous momentum acquired, till my body</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have fallen for 48 minutes. If I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage then to grasp a projecting rock, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">commence to fall back again toward the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon. I reasoned that once more my momentum</seg><seg type="columnLine">would carry me past the center and I would then be</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost carried to the mouth of the opposite crater--</seg><seg type="columnLine">my original starting point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say almost, for the friction of my body against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air would tend to retard my fall. If at this point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where my speed was again zero, I could not succeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in taking hold of a projecting rock of the crater's</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, I would begin to fall down once more, the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">as before. I would then continue falling back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward exactly like a bouncing ball, each time, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever--just like a rubber ball--a little less than on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous plunge. Thus my drops would become of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter duration, and finally I would fall no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I had mentioned betore, the sun was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead, shining down into the crater. 1 also re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered that it was almost exactly 12 o'clock mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, terrestrial time, when the meteor smashed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">aerial; this, then, was the time I started on my re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable journey into the bowels of the moon, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tremendous effort I pulled out my chronometer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted that it was 12.23 a. m. In another minute I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would fly past the center of the moon. Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, I saw in the uncertain light that I went whizz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through an immense hollow, proving to me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the moon was far from solid, due no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt to the centrifugal force of the moon at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time when it had not solidified, some millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago. I estimated later that the moon was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense hollow sphere with a solid crust about 500</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles thick. By way of a homely comparison, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon therefore must be a hollow globe like a rubber</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball. And like the latter, it is filled inside with air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while its crust can be compared to the rubber of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In another minute I had passed the center and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now dropping toward the other side of the moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If 1 continued falling in my present position. I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally emerge at the opposite side with my feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the sky, as a little reflection will reveal to you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So once more I jerked my body about, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling-'up,' with my head at the top, my feet point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the sun. At the end of another 24 minutes I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could feel my body slowing up from the terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. As the crater at this side of the moon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunately rather narrow, I found little difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reaching for a projecting rock as soon as my</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge had come to a dead stop. I held on for dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and clambered up a narrow ledge, where I fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">down exhausted and panting from my dreadful ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ft\7'OU would, of course, like to know my sensa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tions in falling through 2.164 miles of space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">going over 16 miles per second at the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon. Well, the first minute it is rather unpleasant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Highly so. The place where your stomach should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">by right is one vast area of nausea. But once you</seg><seg type="columnLine">become accustomed to it, it becomes bearable, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is nothing else to do. You might think that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush of air would kill you in a few seconds, or else</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw all the air out of your lungs, and thus asphyxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate you. But neither is the case, for the air is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin on the moon that the rush is not as terrific as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be on earth. Also, by keeping the mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly shut and breathing--with difficulty, it is true</seg><seg type="columnLine">--through the nose, one does not die in 48 minutes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The friction of the air against my body did not ignite</seg><seg type="columnLine">either, for, as I told you some time ago. the tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture inside the moon is near the absolute zero, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful cold of the stellar world. But neither did I</seg><seg type="columnLine">freeze to death, for the simple reason that the fric-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of my body through the attenuated air was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient to keep me comfortably warm. Thns you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, that if it had not been so cold, I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned up; and. if the friction of the air against</seg><seg type="columnLine">my body had not heated it. I would have frozen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death long before I reached the center of the moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, too, another important point to consider is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that on the moon, as I explained before, my body</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighed 27 pounds, against 170 pounds on earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is, of course, a rather small weight, and for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason my fall was not as terrible as it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARON MUNCHHAUSFN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been if my body had weighed 170 pounds, as it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth. For that reason, too, 1 was not attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much to the sides of the crater as 1 would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been otherwise. Also it was fortunate that the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">craters widened out considerably the further down</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went into the moon's interior. As a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, the 'hole' of each crater at no point was less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than three miles in diameter. This was indeed very</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky for me, for the following reason:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we drop a stone into a very deep and narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft, this stone will never reach the bottom, as has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been shown experimentally on earth. Instead, it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">bury itself in the eastern wall of the shaft long be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore it gets near the bottom, providing the shaft is</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep enough. The explanation is that the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotates on its axis from west to east at a speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">1,524 feet per second at the equator. Thus it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent that the earth revolves more quickly than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone can fall in a few seconds.* It therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">intercepts the stone's flight, with the result that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone must of necessity strike the eastern wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft. This phenomenon is termed 'the falling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a body toward east.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, precisely the same condition exists on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, of course. Fortunately, 1 started falling at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the western side of the crater, but as the latter was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so wide, I never came near enough to its eastern wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hit it. Likewise the other crater, at the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the moon, measured some four miles in dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meter and. while I finally did reach the eastern wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my flight had come to an end as explained already.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, nature favored me all through, for the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotates with a velocity of but 15 1-3 feet per second</seg><seg type="columnLine">at its equator, against a tangential speed of 1,524</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet of the earth. For this reason there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger that my body would collide with the sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crater somewhere in the interior of the moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But in the meanwhile my troubles were far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">being terminated. No sooner had I regained my</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath than I became conscious of the terrible cold;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I was now but a few feet from the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, on that side which was turned away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, where only icy cold, darkness and desolation</seg><seg type="columnLine">reign. Aside from this, I was some 2,160 miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from Flitternix, my companion, and our 'Inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar.' Walking around half of the moon was out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the question; neither could I stay where I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">without freezing to death. So I climbed up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the moon with considerable effort. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the aid of the starlight. I ran rapidly around to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the western side of the crater, for I had to run in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to keep warm. After having obtained my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearings by the aid of the stellar constellations, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make sure that I was at the western side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater, I took a deep breath, looked down in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abyss through which the sun was shining from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side, and dived head down into space once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, I had reasoned that it was far better</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attempt the flying journey through the moon once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than to perish with the cold on the dark side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon. Besides. I had experience now and. hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing been successful once, it was natural that I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect success again. I had nothing whatever to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose, and everything to gain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My first experience was repeated without any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> * The speed of a falling body at the surface of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the first second is 16 1/12 feet.

I calculated that I should land</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the eastern wall of the far crater within 48 min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes, if everything ran smoothly. But I had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">our good old sun out of my calculations. You see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gravitational attraction of the sun controlled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall of my body in the same proportion as it controls</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rotation of the moon, of the earth and of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets. I mentioned how, in my former flight, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had risen to the top of the moon; as a matter of fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat higher, for the opening of this crater was</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher than the surface of the moon. But now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was falling toward the sun, and the sun was aiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">and accelerating my flight; for I moved constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For this reason, at the end of 48 minutes, I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not strike the eastern end of the crater. Instead, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">whizzed right past the eastern wall, almost brushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and continued to rise up into the air about 100</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, before my speed was spent. I promptly pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared myself to plunge down into the crater again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, before I realized it, I had begun to fall down</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more, when the unexpected happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suddenly felt a rope encircling my body, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">before 1 had time to think, I was jerked sideways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">In another second I had fallen on a heap of sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was looking with astonishment into Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flit ter nix's eyes!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tt^pl-IIS is what had happened: Flitternix had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">J. of course, seen me fall into the crater, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had rushed to the edge, he had seen how I dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with lightning speed. Looking closer, he also</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed what I saw, namely, that the crater went right</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the entire mass of the moon, for he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the stars shining through from the other end. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was loath to believe that the fall would kill me, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a scientist of note, he calculated exactly, in ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance, what was likely to happen to me. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected that it would take me some two hours to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the round trip, as he knew that I could not possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay at the other side of the moon.

Unper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed as he is by such mere details, he went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Interstellar' and had his lunch. Within two hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">he returned to the crater, armed with a telescope</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a long rope. It did not take him long to locate</seg><seg type="columnLine">me down in the abyss by means of his glass, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rapidly coming to the surface then.

Without water, life, as we know it, cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">exist. Now, ages ago, the shortage of water had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made itself felt on Mars. Long before the first cave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man appeared on earth, Mars had been an old world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where civilized peoples had reigned for centuries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While our ancestors were still jumping from limb to</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb among the trees in primordial forests and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungles, the water problem on Mars had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">acute. The fertile lands were fast turning into</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserts, for rains had become more and more infre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent, until they had stopped almost entirely. Fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thermore, as Mars is flat, practically without moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains of any sort, there could not be any natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivers to convey the water to the plains and valleys</seg><seg type="columnLine">as is the case on our world.

For the long unswerving straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines which we see are part of the canals bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water down from the poles to the desert land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there to irrigate it.

The largest, Phobos. is about</seg><seg type="columnLine">36 miles in diameter, while the smaller, Deimos, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only 10 miles in diameter.

In a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian morning, therefore, Phobos can be seen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly change from new moon to first quarter, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">full moon, then last quarter and finally again new</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon; and all this in 7/ hours! A unique feature</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Phobos. too, is that it revolves more quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Mars than Mars revolves upon its own axis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars turns around its axis in 24 hours, 37 minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 22 seconds. Thus the Martian 'day' is almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">38 minutes longer than the terrestrial day. During</seg><seg type="columnLine">one Martian day, therefore, Phobos has spun more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than three times around Mars! As seen from Mars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phobos appears about as large as the Moon appears</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the inhabitants of the Earth. Deimos, the smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, is 12,300 miles distant from Mars. Whereas</seg><seg type="columnLine">its larger brother takes but I'/z hours to revolve</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Mars, Deimos requires 132 hours to complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">its circuit, or almost six days. However. Deimos is</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far removed from Mars, and it is such a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">object, that to the Martians it really does not appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a moon at all--at least not as we umlerstand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">term. For it must be apparent that if we view an</seg><seg type="columnLine">object measuring 10 miles across from a distance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">12,300 miles, we can hardly expect to see much. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reason.

For the Martian atmosphere is consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably thinner than the terrestrial one, and for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason it does not absorb so much light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After circling around Mars at a height of 10,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles for some time, we finally decided to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing.

While I was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring open-mouthed at the nearest Martian, Flitter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nix, who had recovered first from his surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nudged me and said: 'Didn't I tell you?'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NLY then did I remember our discourse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">V/ the previous day, when we were speculating</seg><seg type="columnLine">together as to the probable appearance of the inhabi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tants of Mars. I remember now that Flitternix had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said something like this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have seen on Earth that animal life is pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible under the most adverse conditions. We find</seg><seg type="columnLine">life at the North Pole in the most awful cold, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we find life at the equator in the most intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat. We find life in the thinnest mountain air, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we find life at the bottom of the ocean. The latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">is particularly interesting, because even up to a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago, scientists of note denied that a fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">large creature, such as a fish, could withstand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous pressure of water at the bottom of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean. For, the scientists argued, the fish would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be crushed to death by the thousands of tons of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">above it. Not only that, but they argued further</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, as it gets colder as one descends into the depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ocean, the temperature finally drops below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the freezing point of fresh water. How, then, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fish live in such an abode? It was simply impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible. The fish might just as well live in a frying</seg><seg type="columnLine">pan. The arguments were strong indeed against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility of life at the bottom of the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But then the Challenger expedition came along</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carried on deep-sea dredging. No sooner had</seg><seg type="columnLine">this expedition begun to dredge, than they fished</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bottom of the ocean, a most astounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimen of deep sea fish, built on a plan to with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand enormous pressures. True, it was dead when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it arrived at the surface of the ocean, but it was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be expected, for as soon as the enormous pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which the fish was accustomed was taken away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he naturally burst inside. So our 'wise' scientists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their beautiful logic, were wrong once more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impossible, as always, was found to be very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mention this only in passing, to show you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">life can accustom itself to almost any condition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are very few exceptions, indeed, to this rule,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seems to me. Therefore, we have absolutely no</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to believe that the little planet Earth, among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the billions of the worlds, should be the only fortu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nate one on which life thrives. Arrhennius has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstrated already how life is propagated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one planet to another. This famous philosopher has</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown that minute life-carrying spores so small</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they cannot be seen by the naked eye, are car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried through space, propelled by the pressure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight til) they strike another heavenly body. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conditions are suitable, the spore will germinate</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time and life will spring up--if it is not there</seg><seg type="columnLine">already--on that world. It has been proved that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these spores can exist in an absolute zero and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect vacuum for years, without losing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">germination power--another proof how nature pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tects life under almost unbelievable conditions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore, to say that there is life only on the Earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not only idiotic in the extreme, but it also reveals</seg><seg type="columnLine">a total lack of appreciation of the wisdom of Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty Nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, it is also an indisputable fact that plants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals and humans, too, are entirely dependent</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon their surroundings. If, for instance, you take</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Eskimo and transplant him and his family on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">island under the equator, his light color will change</seg><seg type="columnLine">into black in a few generations. Likewise evolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">shows that the human body very quickly adapts itsel f</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the tasks imposed upon it. Thus a man whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandfather and father were hard-working laborers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will nine times out of ten inherit a bony as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">robust body and a relatively small brain. Whereas</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man whose grandfather and father were mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maticians, nine times out of ten will have a compara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively small-boned body, which is far from robust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his brain will be large.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surroundings are everything, and given time they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will transform man or animal into different beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now let us apply this reasoning to Mars and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us see what we will find. To begin, it has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved beyond dispute that Mars has an atmosphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, although thinner than that of the Earth, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably thick enough to sustain human life, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we know it. Professor Lowell has proved that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mean temperature on Mars is about 47 degrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fahrenheit. In some sections, near the equator, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">instance, the temperature can be less than 65 de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grees Fahrenheit. It was argued in former years</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, on account of the far greater distance Mars is</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed from the Sun than the Earth, the tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture must be far below zero. Recent astronomical</seg><seg type="columnLine">researches, however, completely disproved this. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of fact. Mars proper receives really more</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat than does the Earth, for the following reasons:</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Martian atmosphere is much thinner than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrial, consequently the Sun's rays pierce it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with far less loss than is the case on Earth. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, there are no clouds on Mars to cut off almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">50 per cent of the received Sun's rays, as is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual case on Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then again, the Martian day is almost exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as the terrestrial. Also due to the inclination</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Martian axis, which is almost exactly the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that of the Earth, the seasons are like the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">restrial ones except that they are twice as long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the Martian year is just twice as long as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrial one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, we know that the planet Mars, due to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">small size, has an older life history than the Earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Civilization on Mars must date back several hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand years. The law of evolution teaches us</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we must therefore expect a very cultured, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as accomplished race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As our terrestrial evolution shows, the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">BAKON MUNCHHAUSEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">head is growing larger and larger all the time. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been the same on Mars, for conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are almost the same as on Earth. We must,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, expect to find a race with enormous heads.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the air is thinner on Mars, sound will not carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as in a thicker atmosphere. Therefore, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must expect big funnel-like ears on the Martians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and since a big head almost invariably has big eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we may safely deduce that the Martians have large</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. But there is one important difference of physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal conditions on Mars, as compared with those on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth--namely gravitation. For what weighs one</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound on Earth weighs but 0.38 pound, or a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">over one-third pound, on Mars. Less bodily weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes for excessive growth, for the reason that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity pulls less on the body frame. A little cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culation. based upon the above gravitational figures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leads us to suspect that the average Martian should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mals breathe through their noses as a rule.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As to the Martians' hands, it is probable we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">find them rather small in proportion to the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body. The Martians have probably advanced so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far that manual labor has been abolished for hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of generations. It is almost certain that as</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything must be done with machinery, manual</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor is absolutely unknown today on Mars. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally, in the course of several thousand years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">begins to tell and the hands must shrink. We may</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore expect that the eight-foot Martian has a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand rather smaller than ours. Again, as no physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal labor of any sort is performed by the Martian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms are probably thin and muscleless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As to his feet, we shall, in all probability, find</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to be very large.

It will be seen that the canals, in many cases practically straight, or are almost on the great circles of the planet, suggesting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        very strongly artificial construction, while some of them which are curved, are so regularly placed as to emphasize the idea that they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were constructed by inteUigent beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be about eight feet tall. As the sunlight is very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much stronger on account of the thin air on Mars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian, unless he is in the shade most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, probably has a dark skin, which may be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">red as that of a North American Indian or as dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that of a West Indian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As the air is so thin on Mars and as oxygen is</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed in large quantities for such big bodies as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians, we will not be surprised to find that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian has an immense torso, to accommodate his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponderous lungs. The latter must be doubly large</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to sustain such a large body and also to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work over quickly the small volume of oxygen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thin air.

Miles ahead of me</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched an enormous expanse of black sterility; at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my back was the teeming metropolis, five levels high</seg><seg type="columnLine">--if one counted the hangar-level, which did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover the residence sections.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had not long to wait, for almost immediately my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend appeared. What a sight he presented to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredulous gaze! He was literally covered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to foot with the two-inch ants, that next to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetles, had proved the greatest menace in their at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacks upon humanity. With wild incoherent cries he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled over the rock and stubble-burned earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as my stunned senses permitted, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooped down toward him to effect a rescue, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as my plane touched the barren earth, I saw&gt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was too late, for he fell, borne down by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicious attacks of his myriad foes. I knew it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless for me to set foot upon the ground, for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate would l&gt;e that of Eric. I rose ten feet and seiz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my poison-gas weapon, let its contents out upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the liny black evil things that swarmed below. I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not bother with my mask, for I planned to rise im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately, and it was not a moment too soon. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the waste-land, a dark cloud eclipsed the stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I saw coming toward me a horde of flying ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">interspersed with larger flying insects, all bent upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my annihilation. I now took my mask and prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn more gas upon my pursuers, but alas, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">used every atom of it in my attack upon the non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying ants!

A suffocating sensation seized me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not breathe! How high had I flown in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavor to escape the flying ants? I leaned over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of my plane, expecting to see the city far, far</seg><seg type="columnLine">below me. What was my utter amazement when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that I was scarcely a thousand feet high!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not altitude that was depriving me of the life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving oxygen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A drop of three hundred feet showed me inert</seg><seg type="columnLine">specks of humanity lying about the streets.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">another minute 1 had on my oxygen mask, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to a small portable tank for emergency use,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I rushed for the vicinity of the plant. There I</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnessed the first signs of life. Men equipped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen masks, were trying to force entrance into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked building. Being an employee, I possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the combination of the great lock, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I opened the door, only to be greeted by a swarm ol</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants that commenced a concerted attack upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The floor seemed to be covered with a moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">black rug. the corner nearest the door appearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to unravel as we entered, and it was but a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds before we were covered with the clinging,</seg><seg type="columnLine">biting creatures, who fought with a supernatural</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy born of despair. Two very active ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in getting under my helmet. The bite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their sharp mandibles and the effect of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisonous formic acid became intolerable. Did I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare remove my mask while the air about me was</seg><seg type="columnLine">foul with the gas discharged from the weapons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my allies? While I felt the attacks elsewhere upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my body gradually diminishing as the insects suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumbed to the deadly fumes, the two upon my face</seg><seg type="columnLine">waxed more vicious under the protection of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask. One at each eye, they were trying to blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. The pain was unbearable. Better the suffo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating death-gas than the torture of lacerated eyes!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frantically I removed the head-gear and tore at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shiny black fiends. Strange to tell, I discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could breathe near the vicinity of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen tanks, where enough oxygen lingered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">support life at least temporarily. The two vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects, no longer protected by my gas-mask, scur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried from me like rats from a sinking ship and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared behind the oxygen tanks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This attack of our enemies, though unsuccessful'</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their part, was dire in its significance, for it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown more cunning and ingenuity than anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had ever preceded it.

True, the broadcaster had an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced its dimensions, but the statistics concretely</seg><seg type="columnLine">given had failed to register a perfect realization of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its prodigious proportions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As 1 approached the cage, the creature was lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its dorsal covering toward me and I judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">it measured fourteen inches from one extremity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other.

As I stood there, mentally conjuring a pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of a world overrun with billions of such crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures as the one before me, the keeper approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cage with a meal-portion of synthetic food. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the food has no odor, the beetle sensed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's approach, for it rose on its jointed legs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came toward us, its horn-like prongs moving threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eningly; then apparently remembering its confine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and the impotency of an attack, it subsided</seg><seg type="columnLine">and quickly ate the food which had been placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">within its prison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The food consumed, it lifted itself to its hind</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, partially supported by a box. and turned its</seg><seg type="columnLine">great eyes upon me.

I seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see in my mind's eye the world again over-ridden</seg><seg type="columnLine">with insects, and that calamity due to the indis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cretions of one man! My next impulse was to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">over my problem to scientists, when a suspicion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth dawned upon me. These were seeds, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">germs of plant-life, and they might grow. But alas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where? Over all the earth man has spread his arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial dominion.

Then the television receiving apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">was put into operation, and we sat with breathless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest, our eyes intent upon the crystal screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, to be sure, a mean and unusual trick for a farm</seg><seg type="columnLine">to play upon its owner and the Mayor was both as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonished and sympathetic.

That part of the property covered with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water from the reservoir had been practically the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only really flat land in the whole estate; the rest was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling and hilly, and for the most part, covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber. The lake lay almost in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'farm,' as Wilson called it and, while it completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined the farm for agriculture, it added immensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its charm and beauty. Roughly oval and nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile in diameter, it twinkled in its bed like a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">sapphire encircled with emeralds. Owing to its depth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, according to Wilson's estimate, was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about five hundred feet, the water would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main cold always, which made it an ideal place for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any trout which entered from the creek, to live and</seg><seg type="columnLine">breed in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I said as much to Wilson that evening after sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">mulled the thing over in his mind for a moment, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the possibilities of such a proposition grew upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. he said, 'if that danged lake had fish in it, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't take any price you could name for it. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get more out of the water then than I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">got out of the land and still own it.' And I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was right. Given fish, he had the world by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail. It would make a wonderful summer resort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for cottages could be built along the lake which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring high rent for the season, lie surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed fish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4 6 AND the fish came, but not until we had about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> jt\ given up all hope that they would. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become Wilson's star boarder, for he had invited me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay there as long as I liked, as his guest. I spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the days helping Wilson keep house. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">widower for some years, and wandered about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake, looking for signs of fish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, one afternoon, just at sun-down, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">one feap out of the water. I shouted to Wilson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who answered the call on the run and got there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to see another one jump up out of the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths. He gripped my arm and said, 'Rutherford,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shall need some help, financially. If you want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go in with me. we'll split the profits. What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say?' I thought the matter over for a moment, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him I'd furnish the needed capital. We stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, at the side of the lake, until dark, talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter over and watching the 'dollars,' as Wil-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">son was pleased to call the trout, jump out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. We then went back to the house to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">further plans for the next season.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two weeks later we had a dozen summer cottages</seg><seg type="columnLine">well on the road toward completion. We expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to build more, later, but we figured a dozen, to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">with, would be sufficient, which shows how nearly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of greenhorns can come to making a correct</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess. We could have rented a hundred, if we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Later I wished I had never thought of build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a single cottage. But who could have dreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such consequence?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The cottages, which were erected on a sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">large, cleared space, on the southeast shore of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake, were completed before the cold weather set in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after closing the board shutters over the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows to protect them from possible breakage, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted our time to planning a campaign for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Winter passed reluctantly it seemed to Wilson</seg><seg type="columnLine">and me, but it gave way to Spring at last and shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">after I went to the city. There I had a series of talks</seg><seg type="columnLine">with certain dealers in fish, which resulted, as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the fishing season opened, in a big window display</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strings of trout that made the disciples of Isaac</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walton almost wild to swing a fly over their habitat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A carefully worded legend that accompanied the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">play gave the necessary information. The season</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened with all our cottages occupied and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">making money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">64T r[£RY shortly after, we began to hear strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">V noises, in the night. If we had been very</seg><seg type="columnLine">near a seaport town I should have thought the sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though rather sharp, was given by a ship's siren.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, since we were better than eighteen hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from the ocean, and a thousand miles from</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other body of water large enough to float a ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we concluded that it was a particularly awful whistle</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the railroad, that ran some three miles to the west</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us. It bothered us for about a week, then, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">all other noises that occur at frequent intervals, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to bother us much. There was some specula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion among the cottagers but, when we told them it</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably came from some engine, they accepted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement for fact, and forgot all about it. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, what does a little noise amount to when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishing is good? And it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was only one fault to be found with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake, or its environment. Owing to the altitude and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the added fact that it lay so deep down among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills, the nights were too chilly to permit of comfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the lake after dark. However, there was plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of warmth during the daytime, so it didn't matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">so very much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Along about the first part of July, however, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a stretch of very hot weather. The warmth con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued well into the night, and the early evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours found the lake pretty well dotted with boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">and canoes, passing back and forth near the shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pretty well out into the lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The first break in the calm order of our lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">came one evening, during this hot spell. Wilson</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I were down at the lake, cleaning some trout we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had caught. It was about eight, or a little later and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was getting dark rapidly. We had practically no</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight. We had just finished our job when a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">agonizing scream, as one in mortal anguish, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrating over the lake, from some point down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the southwestern corner.

In reply to our queries, one of the men said</seg><seg type="columnLine">chat the scream came from young Barnaby who, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father and mother, occupied one of the cottages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As it chanced, no one had been out on the lake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except the young man. All the other men, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exception of the two who were on the shore when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we got there, were in Hampton, laying in more sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies. When his mother called to young Barnaby to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in. lie answered he would be 'back in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments,' but for some unearthly reason, had started</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the deepening darkness of the western shore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boy's mother had remained on the cottage porch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">following the lad with a mother's anxious eyes, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddled away into the shadows.

One man said he was certain the boy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to change ends, in the canoe, and had cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized it in so doing. His neighbor was equally cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that he had dimly seen the young man stand up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the canoe and, with the paddle, strike at some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing and then suddenly pitch forward, out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe, screaming as he fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ALL this was told by the two men, while the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  jLiL four of us, in two boats, were racing toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot where the boy was last seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Although the man who declared the accident had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been due to the boy's attempt to 'change ends' still</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck to his opinion, I felt, somehow, that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong. Barnaby was, I had been told, a crack swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer and. considering that he must have been close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shore when he fell into the water, I was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that merely being capsized would hardly have</seg><seg type="columnLine">elicited such a cry of agony. No! I felt, abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely, that there had been some sort of an attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">made upon him and that he had tried to fight off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacker, whoever, or whatever it was, with his pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle, and that he had failed in the attempt. And, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to guess what sort of danger the unfortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy had faced, chills of horror went down my spine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So thoroughly convinced was I that something</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible had happened to Barnaby, and that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond help, that the sight of his overturned canoe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we drew near it, acted only as a sickening con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmation. Yet, knowing that it was useless, I urged</seg><seg type="columnLine">a careful search and, with the others, called his name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and again. They may have hoped; I did not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I merely knew the boy was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I kept my thoughts to myself, however, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">voicing my suspicions would* only make matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse. It would be bad enough to believe her only</seg><seg type="columnLine">son had been drowned, but. I doubted whether her</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason would bear the shock of the awful thing I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in mind. Wilson followed my example.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Having no grappling irons, we would not drag</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake that night, but I told Mrs. Barnaby. who</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore up remarkably well, that I would get some from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hampton in the morning. Hampton had none, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to devise them from clumsily made heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods and hooks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Young Barnaby's father wanted to go with us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but 1 prevailed upon him to remain with his wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt it was l&gt;est, because, while I did not expect to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recover the body, I realized the possibility of some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing very sinister, and I felt it would be better for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him not to see what the irons might bring to the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Maybe he sensed something of my thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he consented at last to remain behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We loaded the clumsy drag with the rope at-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tached (I had bought eight hundred feet, in order</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fo make sure we had enough) into the boat and. with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wilson at the oars, pulled over to the place where the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">accident occurred. We had some trouble getting the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drag into the water, owing to its awkward shape and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weight, but we finally succeeded in lowering it.

Then, there was another ac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cident and, this time, it was a particularly horrible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one.

It was covered with low brush and weeds that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hid the surface of the ground from view, but did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not greatly impede my progress. I plowed my way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the top and started across the rounded back, to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the reservoir. I had gone only a few paces</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, without warning, the ground gave way beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet and 1 soon found myself, in a heap, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravel, at the bottom of what seemed to me to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an over-sized cistern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "1 was not injured but I was considerably shaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, for 1 had fallen about ten feet. For a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 was inclined to laugh at myself, for I cut a funny</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure sitting there, hunched up. But there was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to laugh at. 1 found myself in a serious position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I was imprisoned at the bottom of a hole, sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by unscalable walls of loose gravel. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, no one had seen me at or near this isolated</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, so unless a miracle happened, no one ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come in time to find me alive. Well, sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, staring at the opening through which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen would'do no good, so I began to take my sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings into serious consideration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It soon became evident that the hole had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug by some one for a definite purpose; what that</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose was I had no idea. The opening at the top,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I discovered, had been covered with planks which, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course of a short time had become covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth and vegetable matter; in turn this furnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil in which had grown the weeds that hid the spot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None of the boards had fallen into the hole, nor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there anything I could use to enable me to reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening. As there was nothing else I could do, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to kick gravel from the walls and heap it up</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the pile was high enough to enable me to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the broken boards, grasp some bush, or other</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, and get out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew I had a tedious job ahead, for I had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hands to use as a shovel. At one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole, quite a pile of gravel load fallen of its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight, which gave me a good start. I thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Throwing double handfuls into the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor soon proved to be a bad job. My hat also</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved too slow a method, so I spread my coat, filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. then carried it over to the slowly growing mound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which I dumped these accumulations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had a heap about three feet high when, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">scooping up another double handful, my fingers came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in contact with the surface of a box. I soon had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncovered fully and found it to be about a foot deep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen inches wide, and about two feet long. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to kick the cover off. in order to find out what,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if anything, it contained, when I was moved to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amine it a little more closely first. It was a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I obeyed the impulse, because, after carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">prying off the cover, which had begun to show signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dry rot, I discovered a two gallon cannister of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitro-glvcerine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The reason for the hole became apparent at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been used as a chamber for explosives while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reservoir was in process of construction, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">box very likely had been overlooked when the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very carefully I carried it over and laid it on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, on top of the little heap of gravel. Digging</seg><seg type="columnLine">further I found another box, and another, until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found fifteen. I piled these, pyramid fashion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the hole through which I had fallen; then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">holding my breath and taking care not to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">false step, 1 climbed to the top and soon found my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in the sunshine once more where 1 could breathe</seg><seg type="columnLine">freely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SfTI THEN I reached the reservoir, I found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">VV trout jumping. The fish problem settled, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">started back toward the house for my tackle. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about half the way to the fence when I saw Wilson, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long stick in his hand, trying to head off a cow that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had broken from the corral, and was now headed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mules are supposed to be, and are, stubborn, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it comes to downright 'orneryness,' I think a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cow is pretty much of a fool. Added to this, cows</seg><seg type="columnLine">are nervous things, ready to stampede at a moment's</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice and when they get a notion into their heads,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can't club it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, this cow was a Holstein, and valuable so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Wilson saw her heading for the lake he very</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally objected, considering the sort of tenant</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lake harbored.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was too far away to be of assistance and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast was too much for him alone. Dodging past his</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging club, she drove, head on, for the water, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail, so it seemed, flapping, in derision. She was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the gallop when she reached the water, so she</seg><seg type="columnLine">went entirely under. I saw her come up, a few yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bank and, cow-wise, start for the farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore. I don't know why a cow will always, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar circumstances, make for the farthest point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless it is because as I said, they are just plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">fools.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In his anxiety over his cow, Wilson forgot some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he should have remembered: if the lake was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous place for the Holstein, it was even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous for him. But he may never have thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the lizard at all. At any rate he ran to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little dock that projected out into the water, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting into the boat that was tied there, began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">row frantically after old bossy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was too far away to warn him of his danger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although it didn't actually seem great then; the lake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a great blue gem bathed in the golden rays of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon sun, suggested nothing further than</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimpled beauty, made somewhat sinister by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge that, deep down in its sapphire depth there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been, and might at the moment be, a nameless</seg><seg type="columnLine">and monstrous horror. I guess I have become a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a fatalist; it seems to me, things are pretty much</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid out for us from the beginning. We are sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to be 'free moral agents,' according to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clergy, yet I wonder if we really are. Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilson did not have to go out on the lake. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would he have gone if he had stopped to think. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame can hardly be attached to him for not stopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think. He never did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the time I reached the spot where the cow</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into the water, the animal was about a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards from shore, headed back, for Wilson had over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken her and made her turn back. There wasn't a&gt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to be nervous about, so far as appearances</seg><seg type="columnLine">went, but I was worried, and I urged him to hurry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He waved his hand and nodded and that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last thing he ever did. His hand had barely grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oar again when, silently, from the blue depths,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came into view, just behind Wilson, the awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and neck of the creature, whose shadow we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly seen that night, when we sat crouched on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ANCIENT HORROR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shaky platform spread over the branches of the fal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">len conifer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up it rose, to a height of seven or eight feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I, gazing upon its utter frightfulness, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzed and dumb. I saw its cavernous mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully three feet from snout to the angle of the jaw;</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw it open and reveal its gleaming, needle sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth over the head of the unfortunate man; and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was utterly helpless.

There was a slight working of the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible jaws, perhaps due to some sort of gustatory sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestion of the thing's instinctive machinery, then, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flash, down came the obscene head, the jaws closed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a snap and Wilson, only his legs protruding be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the lizzard's snout, was snatched from his seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the speed and ease with which a hen picks up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a kernel of corn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Horror unspeakable overpowered my mind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think I lost consciousness for a moment. Maybe I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went mad for a time, for I have no remembrance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">having gone to the house, nor, until awakened by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific crash of thunder, did I. have a realization that</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything had taken place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I regained my senses, I sat slumped over</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one of the kitchen chairs.

Shadows of strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories passed through my mind, suggesting noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing definite. Then another frightful crash swept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cob-webs from my brain and 1 felt memory coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with a rush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Other things came quickly, and perhaps for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately, to occupy my mind, and demand my atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, for one of the worst storms I had ever wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed, was brewing fast and furiously.

That there were several currents of</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, coming from as many different directions was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident, from the manner in which the tops of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees behaved. They fairly threshed about. Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently the temperature began to drop and great clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the northwest drove- past, beneath the blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">far overhead, and then the flashes of lightning be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came appalling, as the fire forks darted from cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cloud, while deafening peals of thunder sent every</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose thing a-rattle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then the rain came; came in torrents that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">veritable cascades of driven water, beating in at every</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack and crevice. There was a blinding flash a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards from the house and a tall tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">splintered into kindling, flew in all directions; this</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gale whirled and tossed about, finally driving it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the lake, the surface of which was beaten into</seg><seg type="columnLine">froth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I heard a crash overhead and knew the chimney</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone by the board.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the house was toward the east and since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm had come from the southwest and north, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively dry there. In this closet I found Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's Sunday suit, some shirts and a pair of shoes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">together with a few pairs of socks. The suit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too small, and the shoes too large, but I was in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">position to be particular, so I put them on. Unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have been in a similar predicament, you cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the comfort of dry clothing of any kind or</seg><seg type="columnLine">make.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After wringing out my own. clothes and hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">them over the backs of chairs to dry if the rain ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">let up I piled, some things on the floor and, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, for a bed, I soon forgot all about the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what had gone before it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A ray of sunlight on my eyes, reflected from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror, awoke me. My watch had stopped, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know just what time it was, although I judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must have been about nine o'clock. I was a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff and hungry, but otherwise, in pretty good shape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After drawing the chairs, over which my clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung, into the sunshine, I went down stairs, dug the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet ashes out of the stove, made a fire and cooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">some ham and eggs' and coffee for myself. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I started out to learn the extent of the damage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was plenty. The roof' of the barn had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen in, driving the walls outward.

I found them at last, in a small apple</seg><seg type="columnLine">orchard, apparently no worse for having been out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the storm, contentedly eating grass. I say had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, because practically every one of the trees had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been ruined, the branches having been torn off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, for no particular reason, I strolled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lake.

Soon I became</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of a muffled sound like a rushing of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over a fall, and wondered what caused it. A little</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, I noticed that the floatsani was drifting toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north end of the lake. This was odd. since there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no current and, curious to learn why, I started</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same direction. Soon the muffled sound be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came louder. It was coming from the lake! Puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, like a flash the explanation came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and I started north on the run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I soon reached the place where the noise came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from--a great rent at the end of the basin in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake lay. I looked toward the mound, or, rather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the place where the mound had been, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there 110 longer, and if I had been in doubt as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to what had caused the rent, I was soon in possession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of full knowledge. That unearthly crash had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused by the explosion of those fifteen cases of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitro-glycerine, and there may have been more buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sand, when a streak of lightning found its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the pit in which they were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The rocky floor of the pit must have been a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pot cover, over the subterranean cavern, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">caverns, and the force of the explosion had torn it</seg><seg type="columnLine">away rending the rocks and earth into a great tear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">extending through the wall which held the lake. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done even more; it tore out the wall between it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the reservoir, for I found, upon going around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chasm to the dam, that the water was rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowering. While I stood there, amazed at the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the charge, a large block of concrete from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the dam nearest me, broke loose and fell with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a splash, into water. Evidently, I thought, the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">dam was being undermined and was liable, at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, to fall. I made haste to get away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, and I acted wisely, for within ten minutes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole enormous structure of concrete crumbled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell; a part of it going completely out of sight in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole in the bed of the reservoir, while the rest went</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the opposite direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was apparent, since the chasm was enlarging</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily, that it would not take long to empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">both reservoir and lake and. being minded to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish, I went back to a point of safety, on the east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern shore, sat down 011 a rock and waited for the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ffQITTING there, wondering into what profound</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O	depths the waters of the lake and reservoir</seg><seg type="columnLine">were plunging, speculating upon the possible truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some tales I had read concerning people discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">living in a 'World Beneath a World,' I forgot, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, what was taking place before my eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was aroused from my reverie by a snort, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming back to actualities, I looked to see what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced it.

My powers of description are far too limited</seg><seg type="columnLine">to adequately describe that monster. Its body, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least the upper part, was fully exposed. Swan-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">in shape, it appeared to be nearly sixty feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point where the neck joined the body, to the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its tail, which resembled, in a way, the tail of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">duck. This body, armed or equipped with flappers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to those of a seal, but enormously larger, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a greenish black and was covered with what might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been, the slime and ooze of ages. Its neck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flexible as that of the swan, was fully two feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter at its base, tapering slowly to the head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight feet from the body. The head was a com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">posite of the crocodile and the tyrannosaurus, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">much larger, with loosely articulated jaws, permit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting of tremendous extension, as is the case with</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain snakes. The mouth, armed with teeth fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">six inches in length, was at least three feet long from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snout to the angle of the jaws. To add to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightfulness, the upper canine teeth, or fangs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved outward and downward over the lower jaw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were, as near as I could judge, at least ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches long. A more horrible creature I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine, and I wondered whether it might be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of some species that had never been cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logued. or whether it was what it appeared to be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hybrid. I think it was the latter and. since it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only one that had come into the light of modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, I also wondered if the thing could have begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">its existence away back there in the mesozoic era.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed impossible, and yet, who knows. At any</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate it certainly looked ancient enough to have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">born long before creation began.

Son of one of the wealthiest of our citizens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was prominent in all the big social activities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "upper set," and a member of all the exclusive</seg><seg type="columnLine">clubs. His name was constantly appearing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public prints, and I made the most of this oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to get a line on the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke in low, cultured tones, not looking di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly at us, and toying with a paper knife in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous fashion as he talked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I find myself in a most embarrassing situation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Fenner," he said, "and Davidson tells me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is unable to give me any assistance, because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter cannot be considered as legitimately in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. I suppose he's right. Also, I admit that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am showing poor sportsmanship in asking aid in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this business, but you will understand that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the money involved that leads me to unfair play.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am in a fair way to become the laughing stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the city, and at all costs this must be prevented."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And what is the difficulty, Mr. Watson?" Fenner</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked politely, as the clubman paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a silly bet that I was foolish enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make at the Lynx Club with young Fair yesterday</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon. We were discussing some of the popular</seg><seg type="columnLine">books of the day, and finally worked around to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">detective story which is having quite a run. Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've read the thing--chap is murdered in a room</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which there is no apparent ingress possible with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out detection--that sort of stuff. I remarked that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this kind of business was drivel--that in every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day life such things could not, and did not, take</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Young Fair, with all the romanticism of</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth, defended the writer and his clan. Said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">things occur in reality that outdo the marvelous</seg><seg type="columnLine">happenings of fiction. The dispute grew rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotter than either of us liked, and--well, we ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a bet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fair offered to bet me five thousand dollars that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he personally could demonstrate to a selected com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittee that the mysterious entrance or exit from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a room as described in this book was quite possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I accepted the wager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The committee was selected, and the conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed on.

He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be allowed the entire night in which to effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">his escape. If he succeeded, I agreed to find him</seg><seg type="columnLine">within 48 hours, and to explain how he got away</seg><seg type="columnLine">or forfeit the wager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The arrangements were made, and he entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chosen room at eight last evening.

He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fenner made no effort to conceal his grin. "Put</seg><seg type="columnLine">one over, eh? Any idea how he managed it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not the slightest," confessed Watson, dejectedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Apparently it is impossible. Yet he is gone. Mv</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty-eight hours are slipping away rapidly, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems as if I am slated to lose. I don't regard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money at all, you will understand. I. would give the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little devil that much if he asked for it. It is the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of having the young jackanapod hoodwink me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this fashion that makes me determined to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">him if I can. Yet I haven't any idea where to</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin. Now 1 am making you this offer.

"The</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected room was in the Commercial House. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning we forced the door, doing some little dam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. I told the proprietor that I would send work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men around to make the necessary repairs. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">may represent yourselves as locksmiths without</seg><seg type="columnLine">arousing any suspicion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right," Fenner agreed, cheerfully, "and now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Watson, give me a concise account of Fair's last</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We finally chose a room on the twelfth floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fair accepted this room without comment, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">suited me. It opens into a long corridor, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">leads to the elevator. It is much like the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms on that floor. The reason that it appealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me was that it was situated quite a distance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire-escape. In fact, it is inconceivable that Fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed out through the windows of the rooms."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Granting that he had nerve to venture out over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the abyss, couldn't he reach the roof ?" queried Fen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Watson shook his head in negation. "Three stor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies above, is the out-jutting cornice,- you know. Prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically no hand or foothold on the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. I don't imagine a cat could make it. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can eliminate the windows. The hotel proprietor</seg><seg type="columnLine">assures me that there are no secret passages, spaces</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the walls or anything of that sort in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. I take his word for it. Now as to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors. There are two. The one leading into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room from the corridor by which Fair entered, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one within the room in the left wall, leading into an</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjoining room, which also has a door opening into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corridor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Both these doors have ordinary locks, not dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">latches. For this reason, I suppose, they have also</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolts. There is a bolt on the inside of the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">which opens on the corridor, and a bolt on the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the room. There is a bolt on the other side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that door, by the way, within the adjoining room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked this morning. And for the occasion, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">put a bolt on the outside of the corridor door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When Fair entered the room we shot this out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side bolt. He shot the one on the inside. That's why</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to force our way in this morning. That bolt</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the inside was still in place. So also were both</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolts on the other door. And there you are."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fenner arose. "Your description of the condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions is good, Mr. Watson," he said, "and now Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I will become locksmiths and go down and see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can do anything for you. If T am able to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">you out, I'll call Davidson on the 'phone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do that," agreed Watson, "and remember, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money is all yours if you can successfully unravel</seg><seg type="columnLine">this mystery."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MASTER KEY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fenner nodded, and we passed out. leaving Wat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son seated at the table. As we passed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer office, Davidson favored us with a wink and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grimace to which Fenner replied by forming with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands a very creditable imitation of the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears of a mule.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We made our way to Fenner's house, attired our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves in working clothes, took a few- tools, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught a downtown car. As we rode, I ventured to</seg><seg type="columnLine">question Fenner, hoping that he might have a pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible solution to the riddle. He proved non-com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Wait.

That, I take it, is proof enough that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite possible. Here we are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On stating our errand to the manager, we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no trouble in securing admission to the room, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the departing bell-hop left us alone in the room from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Fair had contrived to find an exit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The damage to the door was trivial and Fenner</seg><seg type="columnLine">set about making the few necessary repairs. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">search carefully. Bill," he said, as he applied him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to the task of replacing the torn off bolt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its keeper, "and make sure that our young friend is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not here, disguised as a bed or a clothes tree."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ignoring the banter, I did make a thorough ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amination of the room, having come to the conclu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion 011 the way down that Fair might just possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">have remained in the room, avoiding detection by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some clever expedient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My efforts were fruitless, however, for a search</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced me that he could not possibly be in hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conditions were just as described bv Watson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no disorder or sign of unusual physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to suggest a possible answer to the enigma.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A glance out of the window assured me that Watson</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spoken the truth. Just to fancy a human being</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to the surface of that wall at that height</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sickening, and I felt convinced that Fair had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not made the fire-escape. Yet the bolted doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed proof that he had not passed through either</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, for it is possible to lock a door after you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">but hardly so to shoot a bolt inside of a closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Also the fact that there w-ere bolts on the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of each of these doors made it look like a rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult proposition for him to have opened them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, let alone having bolted them behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ceiling, examined from the vantage point of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, was as fruitless of clues as the previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutinized floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And now." said Fenner, after these details had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been attended to.

"I don't need money that badly. Watson's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short sport, or he would have seen this thing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, and not asked to buy the brains which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently lacks.

Naturally, it was not long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I was on my way in response to his request,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I knew that my friend would not call me away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my work without good reasons. Moreover, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">expenses were to be paid, and that appealed to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scottish blood!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hargraves met me at the depot on my arrival in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington and whisked me away to his apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once. No mention, other than that it was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing big, was made of the cause of his telegram,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I was comfortably settled in his study, after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good hot .shower and a general clean-up necessi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated by my journey. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we were snugly ensconsed in front of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable open fire, my host took a pile of fools-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap and drawings from a side table, and laying them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his knee, he leaned back in his chair and began:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have here a translation of one of the volumes</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained in the library and need the assistance of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychologist and an astronomer to work out de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails of tlie apparatus described here and, afterwards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the operation thereof. It is nothing less than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">signaling apparatus with which we can get into com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munication with the Martians--that is, if they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">still there," he added. "It is really a type of radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitter, but to me it appears to be totally new</seg><seg type="columnLine">in principle. Knowing that you are a radio enthusi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ast and that you have done much work on the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject, I secured permission to get you to oversee the</seg><seg type="columnLine">construction of the apparatus and assist me in get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting in touch with the Martians.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can go over this translation and the diagrams, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have had copied, this evening after dinner--it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly time for that now. Like to take a glance at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drawings before going in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took the proffered papers and glanced at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diagrams. As Dr. 1 largraves had intimated, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas were new to us. Though it would be classed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a radio transmitter, it was totally different to any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I had ever seen before. Gone were the famil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iar valves and oscillating circuits, they were replaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by purely mechanical methods of setting up the ether</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbances. The instrument was directional, send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out a beam that deviated from parallelism by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely small amount, hence the output of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangement was conserved, necessitating but a mi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nute fraction of the power that would be required to</seg><seg type="columnLine">operate even the most efficient of our beam trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During dinner we discussed the probability of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">signals being heard. According to Hargraves, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians had erected permanent receivers at various</seg><seg type="columnLine">points on the planet, connected with an alarm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recording system, so that as soon as the Earth re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied to the long-delayed message, the inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other planet would know that we had at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">found their gift to us. They had promised that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the receivers would remain in place and in order, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as there was the slightest chance that the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">would reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At-the conclusion of the meal, we again repaired</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the doctor's study and there I read the instructions</seg><seg type="columnLine">for making the receiver and the transmitter. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the facilities that were to be placed at my dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posal, T knew that it would not be long before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first signal would be directed towards its goal. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not understand the fundamental principles on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the operation of the apparatus was based, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">from references given in the text I learned that 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find them elucidated in another volume; Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graves promised to have this translated for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was introduced to Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smythe, the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">department under which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to work, and arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were quickly made</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were satisfactory to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all concerned. With three</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistants I set to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">without losing any time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a few days the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struments were well under way. The work was</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully apportioned among the three men so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no clue as to the exact nature of the apparatus they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were constructing could be obtained by any one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and the secrets of the instruments could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">leak out. As it came to me, part by part, I carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked them over from the original specifications</seg><seg type="columnLine">and assembled them into the components of the fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished transmitter. Gradually I began to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exact nature of the power used, and as I studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the works referred to in the text of the instructions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">T learned how to adjust and operate the apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">when in operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'JT'IIOSE of our readers who have read "The Retreat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">-* to Mars" will be interested in the present story,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which Is a sequel thereto. Mr. White, the author, who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is an astronomer, is so well informed about this subject,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that zee read with bated breath, his most unusual, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">well as powerfully written story.

A powerful telescope was needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to direct the beam of the transmitter to the far dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant receivers, and the necessary instructions for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">construction and its operation were given. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced more than far enough to take care of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the work ourselves, so these instructions</seg><seg type="columnLine">were only read in a cursory manner, though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained several new and far-reaching ideas that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would repay later study. It was unnecessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">construct an instrument specially for this work, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one I owned in my observatory was powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, and, with the slight modifications we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to make, we could use it in conjunction vyith the</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitter. The receiver lacked a few minor parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we left Washington, and these were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">forwarded to us as soon as they were finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The projector was connected to the telescope in</seg><seg type="columnLine">due course, all other work being suspended, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjusted so that the axis of projection was parallel</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the optical axis of the telescope. This adjustment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very delicate for, as I mentioned before, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam was practically non-divergent and, as the area</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would cover on the planet's surface would subtend</seg><seg type="columnLine">a solid angle of but four seconds of arc, the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">care had to be taken in making this adjustment. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had also to ascertain the effects of flexure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope tube in different positions and to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">table of the necessary corrections to be applied to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminate this error in setting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through some misunderstanding, the parts for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the receiver had not arrived by the time we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to make our first attempt to communicate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars. Nevertheless, we decided to make an attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">at letting our neighbors know that we were at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to communicate with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anxiously we watched the sky the afternoon be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the actual test took place, but it was cloudless</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was every indication of a good night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I checked up my computations carefully, so that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sure that there were no mistakes in the position</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the points to which the telescope had to be directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order that the signals might reach the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">receivers. It was necessary, of course, to direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beam to a point where the receiver would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the signals reached the planet--the velocity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the radio waves being finite. Three factors had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be taken into consideration on directing the beam.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first was that the planet was not where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed it to be for, due to the finite velocity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, the planet was somewhat ahead of the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it was observed, the amount depending upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the relative positions and distances of the Earth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars in their orbits; then again the time that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signals would take to reach the planet had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken into consideration. The second correction was</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to the refraction a beam of light suffers on enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing our atmosphere except when coming vertically</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward, this phenomenon making an object ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear higher in the heavens than it really is. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">third factor has already been mentioned, that due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the flexure of the telescope tube.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two o'clock found the planet high enough in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southeast to warrant the attempt. The seeing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair and with a power of six-hundred it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult to set on the computed position. Hargraves</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed a key of the twelve-keyed keyboard used</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a single long dash was sent on its way, hurtling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with the speed of light towards its goal, 82.000,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Martian code is difficult to describe without</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering into it fully. It was sent with the aid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve keys, each key altering the characteristic form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the "carrier-wave." The keys could be pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in combinations, with the result that a competent</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator could send a message almost as fast as</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech. Hargraves had become quite an adept with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and I had made a little progress, but not enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to transmit well. That was left to my companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following a series of calling dashes, Hargraves</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent off the following communication:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have discovered the library that was left by</seg><seg type="columnLine">your pioneers after their attempt to colonize this</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet had failed and, according to the instructions</seg><seg type="columnLine">left for the discoverers, we are attempting to estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish communication with you. Do not reply to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">message, because our receiver has not yet been in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalled. We will inform you when we are ready.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We are now going to repeat the signals to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiving station in case this is not heard.

It must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered that any translation that can be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Martian language into our own, must, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity, be decidedly free. The two languages have</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing in common, only the thought-forms can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be given. For this reason, the above is but a free</seg><seg type="columnLine">translation of the messages sent hurtling through</seg><seg type="columnLine">space to the planet of mystery at the rate of 186,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The call signal was repeated four times, and four</seg><seg type="columnLine">times the same message was sent out that night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each time to a different receiver, in the hope that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them, at least, would reach its destination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We would have to wait until the remainder of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiver arrived before we could learn if we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been successful or not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four days later the receiver was completed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rapidly installed, but much to our chagrin the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night was cloudy and never once did we catch a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of the planet, although the telescope was</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept pointed to it throughout the night and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyepiece was never left for an instant when there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the slightest chance of catching a glimpse of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following night was more favorable, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were able to see the planet long enough at a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to allow a setting to be made on the computed posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and to send our call out once more, this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed by a short announcement to the effect that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were ready to receive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For fifteen minutes, in which time a returning sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal should have reached us, we waited anxiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minute by minute passed without a single sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">emanating from the receiver phones, with which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were both equipped. _ Our attempt, we thought, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed.

Evidently the Martians could not get their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearings well enough to direct their beam to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">correct position for it must be remembered that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on the unilluminated side of the Earth. East-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood had heard the signals intended for us, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cloudy spell broke that afternoon, leaving us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a clear sky. Full of expectation, we sent our</seg><seg type="columnLine">signals out once more as soon as the planet was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">position. Twenty minutes after our first call, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headphones, with which we were both equipped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clattered violently, causing us to remove them. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing the intensity, we replaced them and Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graves commenced to put into shorthand, the mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage that roared through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Train upon the Elysium receiver." commanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">my companion, after the phones had ceased sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I rapidly computed the new setting point and</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed the telescope thereon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At my "All set," another message was sent out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guiding the telescope, as I was, I had no idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was going out or coming in. I would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait until we were all through before I could learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the context of the messages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the biggest thrill I had ever experienced as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sat back there on the observing ladder, with my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes glued to the binocular eyepiece and my fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the slow motion controls with which I corrected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slight irregularities of the driving clock. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the image would be blurred by a wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor seeing, and I would strain to hold the cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires on the point on which I was guiding, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">landmarks having disappeared in the general blur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours were taken uji in this way, without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">break other than was necessary to turn the dome or</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift the ladder, as the rotation of the Earth carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet across the sky. Eventually Hargraves</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the cryptic remark, "Well, that's that! All</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, old man. Come and get some coffee and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a smoke; you need it. I'll read this out to you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was glad of the respite, for the strain had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">great and my eyes and head ached with the intensity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my efforts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT would take up too much space in this account</seg><seg type="columnLine">to repeat the messages sent and received, word</seg><seg type="columnLine">for word.

Then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported that signals had been heard by an experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menter in another locality, some three hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and inquired if these emanated from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitter. At this we stood by for the return</seg><seg type="columnLine">message, which, as you know, nearly deafened us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its intensity. The message ran as follows:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Congratulations. We were expecting the library</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be found about this time. Our observations</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that it was still where we left it. We heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">all your signals; they were quite strong and well</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed. It is unfortunate that you did not hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">us last night; the error was ours. Conditions at</seg><seg type="columnLine">our transmitting station were none too good, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, combined with the masking of the lights of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your cities by dense clouds, caused an error to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. You were evidently just outside the beam.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tell us how the discovery of the library came about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now transmit to us for 0.0049 day*--during this in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terval we will transmit to you. then stop to receive</seg><seg type="columnLine">the message, which will take that time to reach you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In this way no time will be lost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following the receipt of this message, Hargraves</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to our Martians an account of his deductions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the resulting discovery of the library. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments after his conclusion, the phones sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and a communication of about seven minutes'</seg><seg type="columnLine">duration was received. This was followed by others</seg><seg type="columnLine">at intervals of the same length. My companion's</seg><seg type="columnLine">messages were accounts of the progress of civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on this planet and need not be recorded here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The following is an abstract of those received:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shortly after the Retreat to Mars, another un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreseen catastrophe overtook the Martians.

The Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians, being unaware of our system of measuring time were</seg><seg type="columnLine">compelled to adopt this method of conveying the time inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">val to us. This system is used a great deal in astronomical</seg><seg type="columnLine">work for, as will be seen, it facilitates computation consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erably.</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet Mars, but the returning pioneers carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them a new and more malignant enemy than</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heretofore been encountered. This did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack those who carried it back with them, as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">special physique and the acclimatization to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been subjected, had rendered them immune</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it, even though they were carriers. Within a year</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the return of the survivors, the wonderful sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem of the Martians was sadly disorganized; over</seg><seg type="columnLine">half the population were dead or dying from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful plague which swept over the planet like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scourge. Despite their knowledge of bacteriology</seg><seg type="columnLine">and medicine, the plague continued unchecked until</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than one hundred and fifty of the original</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of the planet's teeming population were</seg><seg type="columnLine">left alive. All these were survivors of that ill-fated</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition to the Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stupendous task confronted the survivors. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their calibre could not stand by and see all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had gained lost without a struggle. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">everlasting credit of those heroes of the past, let it</seg><seg type="columnLine">be said that the loss was small and the Martians of</seg><seg type="columnLine">today have them to thank for the advanced position</seg><seg type="columnLine">they hold. Picture, if you will, the problem before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The survivors, few of whom were scientists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they understood the term, had to set to work to</seg><seg type="columnLine">educate their offspring and to inoculate them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high ideals held by the vanished Martian com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munity. The sciences which were first stressed were</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of fundamental importance to the economic</seg><seg type="columnLine">life of the race. They included biology, chemistry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and engineering in all its branches, all the applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciences which were vital to the perpetuation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It must be remembered that the planet was fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing its water supply and that the first thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do was to continue the operation of the vast works</seg><seg type="columnLine">already constructed to conserve the planet's vital</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluid. Truly a tremendous task for so few.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A century later saw the planet's population in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased to a little over twenty thousand inhabitants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These were divided into district groups, each group</seg><seg type="columnLine">being responsible for the upkeep of all the state</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery within its borders--a tremendous task,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for much of the apparatus and plants had suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from neglect during the early part of the century.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thanks to the alloy--which we have called arenium</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that was used in its construction, corrosion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxidation did not affect the pumping machinery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water conservation system; in many places,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, neglect had played its part in rendering</seg><seg type="columnLine">inoperative many of the great public power plants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The social system, that had been developed before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cataclysm, held steadfast throughout the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">trials that any system could be subjected to, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">never once did it waver throughout the darkest times</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet ever knew. It must be said, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the survivors and their descendants continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the desperate remedy, instituted long before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of eliminating all who would or could not work</seg><seg type="columnLine">under their system, thus saving the unity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole at the expense of a few.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under these adverse conditions, it is not to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered at that the Martians made no progress.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Until they discovered how to conquer the subtle dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease that ever threatened them, little advance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in any of the sciences except bacteriology and</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine. Eventually, the corps of workers who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were continually engaged with the problem discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the means of eradicating the loathsome disease,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which was akin to leprosy. From that time their</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance had been slow but steady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It will be of interest to my readers, 1 think, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">record here the report we received on the reception</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our first signals. The first receiver we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained on was one located in the Solis Lacus region,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time there would correspond to about 2 P. M.</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. This particular receiver was located in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">observatory and the quiet of the afternoon had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken by the mellow sound of the alarm, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few moments later by a second. Immediately the</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the observatory staff were in a state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppressed excitement; the Earth had awakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her long lethargy. Connections were at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">made to all the public annunciators and before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">message came through, the whole of the planet knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Earth was in communication with them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last. The direction indicators that were at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">applied, gave them the position of our transmitter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They recognized that the signals were coming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a building they had always suspected of being an</seg><seg type="columnLine">observatory. A few minutes later the second re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiver, the one in the region we call Arcadia, sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">its alarm and the second message--a repetition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first, was received.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 was somewhat surprised at the fact that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians admitted showing excitement at the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceipt of our signals, for I had thought that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotions would have become practically non-existent</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the high development of the Martians. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned later that they had wisely preserved these</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotions, some being developed even. Had this not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the case they would have become machine-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatons and this state was looked upon by them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with horror; only the undesirable had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the conclusion of our inter-communication,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they asked us to call them the following night as</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was an important problem under discussion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they expected to give us some interesting in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE following night the skv cleared about</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleven o'clock, much to our relief, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained clear throughout the rest of the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fifteen minutes after our calling signal had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent out, the answer arrived. As the message came</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, I heard Hargraves exclaim, "Good Lord!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then relapse into silence. Imagine my curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity! The message ceased and- Hargraves turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me with the question, "How would you like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip to Mars?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Are you joking?" I asked in amazement. "No.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I am not," he replied. "The opportunity is offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us. Do you accept ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course I accept," T answered at once. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the journey to be made?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll tell you later, it you are sure you want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go. We can take two others along with us. T am *</seg><seg type="columnLine">going." With that he turned to the keyboard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent a short message.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes the Martian signals commenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and continued for the space of perhaps thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. When they ceased, mv companion said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to my surprise. "That is all for this time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is wrong?" T asked, for we had arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask quite a number of questions in the hope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">solving some of our individual problems.

I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In about fifteen days," Hargraves informed me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen to this." 1 sat on the steps of the observ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ladder while he read the message lie received. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since receiving your first signal, we have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">considering which would be the best method of</seg><seg type="columnLine">learning all we can from you, as well as instructing</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in all the things that we think will be of value</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you. It has been decided that the best method</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be for you to visit us during the coming con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">junction of your planet. To this effect we will send</seg><seg type="columnLine">you one of our space machines to bring you to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. As you probably know, we are not able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">withstand the extra strain to which our bodies are</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjected on the Earth, so that we are not able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay for any length of time. Moreover, we do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to run the risk of bringing disease back to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet again, so we believe it will be best for you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come here with our representatives in the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will be sent for you. You will understand, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel sure, that it is necessary for us to safeguard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">health of this planet above all things, hence you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not feel that you are subjected to indignities, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">special precautions are taken for our protection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The constitution of the atmospheres of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets is nearly identical, so that you will suffer no</seg><seg type="columnLine">inconveniences in that respect though the pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have to be increased for you. We will supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">you with protective coverings in which the pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be kept suitable to your well-being.

You have learned, we believe, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great lesson that, because a thing or phenomenon is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understood, it is not necessary to call in un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural or supernatural explanations to account</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came a brief pause followed by:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your acceptance of our offer has been received.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It will be as well for you to prepare a store of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions to last you at least fifty days, in case that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">food which we can supply proves unsuitable for you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In case you have perishable supplies, we will pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vide methods of preserving them.

It was traveling at a high rate of speed--</seg><seg type="columnLine">about two hundred and fifty miles an hour, I judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">--when it landed, and shot along to the dock, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">wc waited. We had marked our position, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been directed. Luckily, the dock, which be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to a marine engineering firm, was deserted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it was Saturday afternoon and the employees</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left. Only the watchman was present, besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves, as the space flyer swung alongside. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine was about one hundred and twenty-five feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, with a diameter of perhaps thirty feet. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was torpedo-shaped, with single wings, and a span</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a good hundred feet formed the supporting sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces when in the air. It had the familiar rudder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and elevators, but it lacked any visible means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">propulsion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A large glazed port swung inwards as we pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine to the dock, disclosing a figure which</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first glance appeared to be clad in old-fashioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor. He was a giant, fully nine feet tall and, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">one could judge from his protecting armor, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest like a barrel. His head was enclosed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent globe, which fitted into the neck-piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his covering, permitting us to see the smile of greet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon his rather handsome features. His fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head was broad and high, and his head was crowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a mass of curly chestnut hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What the watchman thought, I do not know, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a gasp and a "Lor' lumme!" from him. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told no one of the intended visit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As our little group approached the open port, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant handed us a sheet of material upon which some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was written. Hargraves read it and turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, saving, "Bring the baggage to the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dock." With the aid of the watchman, we trundled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cases up to the machine on a hand truck that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had borrowed, and as each piece was brought tfp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jointed arm, built up on the lazy tongs principle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot out and clasped it. whisking it away into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior of the machine. In a very short time all</seg><seg type="columnLine">our effects were on board and we followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We found ourselves in a broad passageway tra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versing the craft, at the opposite end of which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second glazed port similar to the one that now</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung to behind us. The space was half full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the baggage that had come aboard. Leading aft was</seg><seg type="columnLine">another smaller passage, and down this we were led</seg><seg type="columnLine">by our guide. Four compartments opened off from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this alley and we were directed into one of them. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">we entered, there came a rushing sound and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine began to plough slowly through the water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the broad glazed windows of the cabin we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the dock slide by. The sound grew to a roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the water slipped past us faster and faster, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">our view was obscured by a dense cloud of spray.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the spray cleared and we saw the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the water dropping rapidly away from us. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were aloft and swinging northward at an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed over the harbor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The land dropped away and the topography of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vancouver Island unfolded itself below, its lakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearing like little gems glittering in the sunlight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northward we flew, ever climbing. Soon we /could</seg><seg type="columnLine">descry the smoke of Vancouver, lying like a pall</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Burrard Inlet, and the Fraser River winding</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward into the distant hills. Ever climbing at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific rate, we sped over the mountains while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fjords of the coast appeared below us and the Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlotte Islands rose out of the blue Pacific to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northwest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So great was our pace, that the land, many miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, could be seen swinging by like a panorama.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were up in the rare atmosphere and the roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the driving jets, as I supposed it to be. gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminished in intensity with the lessening atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pheric pressure until presently it was but a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmur. Gradually, even this faint sound faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">out as we passed beyond the limits of the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelope and the familiar blue of the sky gave way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the blackness of interstellar space, studded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its brilliant suns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cabin was now brilliantly lighted by circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">transluscent plates on the walls and ceiling, behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the source of light was hidden. This illumina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was now necessary, for the diffuse light which</seg><seg type="columnLine">illuminates a room through its windows, when there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a considerable amount of air present, was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacking, only a bright patch of sunlight appearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the forward bulkhead of the cabin, which shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint light in the cabin!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am afraid that the impression we had given our</seg><seg type="columnLine">first Martian acquaintance was not very favorable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, in the excitement and interest of leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, we had neglected the elements of courtesy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This thought seemed to strike us all about the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, for Hargraves turned and wrote a short sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tence on one of the pads with which we had provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves, and handed it to the Martian, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained seated since he ushered us into this cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After reading it, he took a small box from his belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it hung, and connected a tube, leading from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to the lower part of his helmet. He then spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few moments. The voice, though muffled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the casing, seemed soft and melodious. After he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spoken, he took a sheet of paper-like substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the box, where it had gradually jerked into</seg><seg type="columnLine">view as he spoke, and handed it to Hargraves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I apologized," said Hargraves to us, "for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudeness in neglecting our host the way we did, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained that the novelty of the situation was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause. Our friend here understands how we feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. Ilis note goes on to explain that the cover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing he wears is to protect him from the danger of</seg><seg type="columnLine">contracting disease, as well as to protect his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the pressure of the air in the space flyer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which will be kept at the barometric height we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to. We will be required to wear some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what similar suits when we go into other parts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this craft. This portion is sealed off and assigned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our use; there are two sleeping chambers opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the cabin is next to this. He will now see</seg><seg type="columnLine">about storing our food supplies,.if one of us will go</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. By the way, this is the commander of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the craft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My wife and I retired with the skipper after Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graves had "introduced" us. In the next cabin were</seg><seg type="columnLine">several large receptacles built into the wall and fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with devices to prevent their contents from moving.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These were the refrigerators which had been prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised us. They were kept at a low temperature by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mixture of chemicals, which absorbed heat on »</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniting--an endothermic reaction. Arrangements</seg><seg type="columnLine">were also supplied for heating and cooking, again</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a chemical nature; this time the admixture which</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave out heat--an exothermic reaction. Two com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon examples of these reactions are: The heating</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a mixture of unslaked lime and water, which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">exothermic, and the cooling of a mixture of sodium</seg><seg type="columnLine">hyposulphite (the photographers' "hypo") and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water--endothermic. We spent the better part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RETURN OF THE MARTIANS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour transferring our food supplies to the food</seg><seg type="columnLine">chests. Eventually we finished and at once repaired</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the observation windows of the main cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. S my the asked the commander for information</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to our speed and other details. We were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">some live hundred miles above the Earth's surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as we could see, over the polar regions. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed was then about forty miles per second and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being gradually accelerated until we reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">final velocity of the order of ninety miles per second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which velocity would be retained until we got near</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our destination. Our guide then offered to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duct us through the machine and let us meet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other members of the crew, which numbered four.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On our acceptance of his offer, he showed us where</seg><seg type="columnLine">our suits were stored, assisted us to don them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed us how to adjust them so that they fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These suits were much like divers' suits, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">likeness was enhanced by the globular helmet which</seg><seg type="columnLine">surmounted them. Following their adjustment, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were shown how to control the air filter and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure adjustments. We then followed our guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward into a small chamber on the walls of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were several dials and indicators. This was an air</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock, and here the pressure was reduced to that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other compartments. The air was sterilized and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our suits were sprayed. Truly the Martians were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking no chances, nor could we blame them, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we remembered the billions of bacilli that were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our system or lurked in our clothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the lapse of a couple of minutes, a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was opened and we entered a large room about</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty feet long and the full width of the machine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the center of it a cylinder, about seven feet high</seg><seg type="columnLine">and five feel in diameter, rose up through an open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the floor. From its top led two large pipes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one passing forward and the other aft. A gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat radiated from them. On the forward wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this cabin, on either side of a central door, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of valves and gauges, or indicators of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some kind. A second Martian came aft to meet us</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we entered. He was heavily bandaged about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thighs and abdomen, but wore no other clothing or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornament. The flesh was brown as though from</seg><seg type="columnLine">continual exposure to the sun; his head, like that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his commander, was crowned with curly chestnut</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. He walked with apparent difficulty, to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stood, with a smile of welcome upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">features; then, turning to his superior, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieving himself of his armor, took the automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">writer from him and dictated into the mouthpiece</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few moments; then held out the sheet. Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smythe took it and read aloud for our benefit. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained a word of welcome and an invitation for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to avail ourselves of the opportunity of having</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mechanism of the craft explained. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted with alacrity and the second giant then took</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This compartment, and the one directly below it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained the power plant of the space flyer. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">central cylinder was the mixing chamber in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chemical fuel of the craft was forced by injec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors. The fuel was in the solid form and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulverized before going to the injectors. On admix-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. it exploded spontaneously and the resulting</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases were led forward and aft by the two pipes we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw. Tl&gt;e pipes divided into four, each branch</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplying a nozzle outside the hull of the craft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These nozzles could be turned and thus the machine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was guided when in space--the jets of incandescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas propelling the machine as a rocket is propelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloft. The tubes and combustion chamber were cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with insulating jackets to prevent undue loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heat--heat being synonymous with energy in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat engine. The pressure in the combustion cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber was of the order of fifteen hundred atmospheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">or about twenty-two thousand pounds to the square</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch; the temperature being 4,200 degrees absolute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which by subtraction of 273 gives the Centigrade</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature of 3,927 degrees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first Martian now joined us, attired in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of his companion. This attire was to sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port their inner organs under the greater strain to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they were subjected on or near the Earth. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now led through the central door in the bulk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to the foremost compartment--the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. Here we saw the third member of the crew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the same fine type as the others, but with slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker complexion, lie was seated in a comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able padded chair and his eyes were at the eyepieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what appeared to be the eye-end of a telescope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as indeed it proved to be. The rounded, transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose of the craft gave the pilot a clear view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens ahead of him. Above the control cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were told, there was the objective of a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">refracting telescope. When passing through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere, a streamline hood swung over this. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">accounts for our not having seen it. The focal</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of the lens, which was over eight feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter, was about one hundred and twenty feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sixty feet away, over our apartment, was a plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror which reflected the converging beam back</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to a point just ahead of the pilot, where an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other mirror reflected the beam down to the eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces. This huge instrument was necessary in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the pilot might avoid any small bodies in space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, with a velocity of such amounts as those we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were attaining, it was necessary to see a body at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least three hundred miles ahead in order to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Bodies too small to be seen with the power used</seg><seg type="columnLine">were too small to damage the craft. Several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">during our journey across the gulf we saw brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashes of light on the transparent nose-cap, due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impact of small particles of matter. This nose-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap was made of one of the toughest and hardest</seg><seg type="columnLine">substances known to the Martians, so hard that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was worked only with the greatest difficulty. Ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects to be made of it were usually cast into shape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to avoid machining. The components of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">lens over our heads were made of the same material,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though of different densities, in order that the lens</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be achromatic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In front of the pilot was a semi-circular dash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, on which the various instruments of naviga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion were mounted. These were pointed out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">described to us. An air speed indicator, automatic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally corrected for varying densities of the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere through which the machine might fly; pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure gauges indicating the pressure in the combustion</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber and the atmospheric pressure; a flow indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cator that showed the rate at which the propelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases left the nozzles, while other instruments sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied the other data that were needed by the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the operation of his craft, such as total-run meter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and space-speed indicator. This latter aroused my</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity. How, I asked, could the velocity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine be measured in space? The method was</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained to me and the theory of it proved to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite simple. One of two periscope-like arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ments projected an image oi the sun upon the slit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a spectroscope of very high resolving power. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sharpest and strongest spectral lines formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the instrument fell upon two line sensitive wires.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the line shifted one way or the other, the extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">heating effect upon one of the wires caused a flow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of electricity to pass through it, which, by an ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangement somewhat like the "Wheatstone bridge,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatically recentcred them. The wires were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected to an indicator. As the space flyer approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">or receded from the sun, fhe spectral lines shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the violet or red respectively--the well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known Doppler-Fizeau effect--thus indicating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity of the machine with respect to the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowing the angle between the path of the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the line joining the machine and the sun, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">-true velocity was easily found by an elementary</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigonometric computation, which was automatically</seg><seg type="columnLine">performed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On returning to our own quarters we were shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to operate the air lock so that we could come</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go at will. My wife had gone to them some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time before and, as we entered, we were pleasantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised to find the swinging table spread witli a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearty supper. I suddenly realized that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry, and on looking at my watch, was surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find that it was after eight o'clock, P.S.T. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been on our way for five hours. The Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">now appeared as a huge silver crescent with a smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. the moon, to the right of and beyond it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The meal finished, we returned to the pilot cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find the fourth and last member of the controls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Martian he had relieved talking to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here we remained, learning more about the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft and its operation. The air supply, we learned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was replenished with oxygen and the carbon dioxide</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed while the air passed through the filters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it did every five minutes, as this system was</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually in operation. For landing, the hull of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the craft was flattened below and stepped like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hydroplane; it was also equipped with wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">that disappeared into recesses in the hull, much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">our earthly "amphibians."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we retired, a gulf of half-a-million miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">had widened between us and the earth, which now</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared as a crescent twice the size the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">presents as seen from the earth. Cynthia herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">was visible, now but a third of her familiar self,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond and to the right of her big sister. The sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to the left--a flaming orb with a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet prominence at least a quarter-of-a-million</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles in height on the western limb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To complete a rather sketchy description of this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our temporary home, I must mention the arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the sleeping quarters. The beds, couches</seg><seg type="columnLine">or berths, which ever you want to call them, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">slung in a frame in such a manner as to always</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain horizontal; below them were cupboards, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we could keep our meagre personal effects.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The machine had been gradually assuming a tilt</seg><seg type="columnLine">upwards towards the bow, until we now had to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand-rails, when we moved about the craft. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rapidly losing weight, too; all our movements</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being made with the greatest ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE following day, according to our reckon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, found us nearly two million miles on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. I was caught unawares on awaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to my wife's amusement, for I sat up suddenly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in bed as is my wont, only to precipitate myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bed until I came into contact with what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the forward bulkhead, but which now</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be the ceiling. It took us some little</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to get used to this new state of affairs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many amusing little incidents took place before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">became accustomed to the rapidly vanishing effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gravity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day after day went by uneventfully, and during</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time Hargraves and Smythe set to work to</seg><seg type="columnLine">master the spoken language of the Martians, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved an easy task to them. My wife and I also</seg><seg type="columnLine">set ourselves the same task and worked at it steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that before we arrived at our destination we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make ourselves understood. The language of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martians is as logical as a language can be;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are no confusing "exceptions" and the verbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">are as simple to master, as are the written ones that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">described in my first account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We spent most of our time in the control cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we neared our destination and watched the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">features of the ruddy planet unfold as its distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">decreased. One afternoon I'caught a glimpse of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">canal like a spider web 011 the planet's surface, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">another and another until the surface was seen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be covered with an intricate network of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the day before our arrival, we were startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see brilliant jets of flame shoot ahead of us. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were from the retarding nozzles which the pilot had</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened. Almost at once the bow of the machine be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came its floor. For the past few days there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been no up or down to us; now, with our negative</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceleration, the direction in which the craft was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing became our nadir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of our suppressed excitement, we slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">well and awoke on the eleventh day to find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet a huge disk slightly to one side of our path.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The flow of the jets was increased from time to time</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we neared our goal. Our pilot was reducing our</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed and directing the craft so that it would strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper layers of the atmosphere tangentially with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the velocity that would carry the machine round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet like another satellite in a circular orbit, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">all power were cut off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we neared the planet, its features became more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more resolved, and I was intensely interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">in noting the development of details, which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed from the Earth as only the most vaguely</seg><seg type="columnLine">defined spots or blurs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We struck the outpost of the atmosphere over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northern point of the Syrtis Major, the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hour Glass Sea," which Huygens had drawn three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years ago. Eastward we swept, ever near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the planet's surface until, when over the region</seg><seg type="columnLine">we call Elyseum, the Trivium Charontis, a veritable</seg><seg type="columnLine">junction of canals, appeared on the horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Lucus Triviae of the Trivium was our ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jective and over this we glided in a great spiral,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "oasis" becoming a tessalated region, centered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a vast city beneath our feet. In a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes we were skimming the roofs of that city;,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, as a vast pile loomed ahead of us, there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight jar and the machine was rolling along a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth runway. We had landed on one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">galleries of a huge pyramidal building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A port below the wings was opened as the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to rest and the commander of the expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out, beckoning us to follow. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no crowds to meet us--only a single Martian came</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward from a large doorway as we alighted. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RETURN OF THE MARTIANS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">79</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were handed over to this newcomer with the advice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were to go to the official welcome. Led by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guide, we entered the doorway into a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber. On our entrance, he pressed one of a row</seg><seg type="columnLine">of numbered switches and the chamber glided</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly away. In a moment or two it stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stepped out into a large, well-lighted room, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows looked out on one of the broad galleries</seg><seg type="columnLine">encircling the building. The diminished sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining through the windows and in the rays of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat a Martian who appeared to be older than any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the few we had met before. He was clad like those</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the space machine after they had removed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">supporting bandages after leaving the Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we entered, he arose and walked over to greet</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, welcoming us on behalf of the people of Mars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At his request, we seated ourselves on the four chairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided for us, in front of a circular plate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some substance that glittered with all the colors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rainbow. This plate was set vertically in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel of arenium and around it were arranged a</seg><seg type="columnLine">set of reflectors of parabolic form with tiny coils</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wire in their foci.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am now going to introduce you to the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this planet," said our host. "This instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmits both the sound of the voice and an image</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anything placed before it. In this way all may</seg><seg type="columnLine">see and hear you. Tell me how you name yourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hargraves "did the honors," telling the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">our occupations as well as our names, and finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">by introducing himself. Dr. Smythe added that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence on Mars was due to Hargraves, who dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the library. At the conclusion of this cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony our host pulled out a small knob that pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected from the panel. The filaments in the reflec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors at once glowed a dull red, and we felt our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves bathed in a gentle heat through our helmets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Facing the screen, the Martian spoke.

We acknowledged our great</seg><seg type="columnLine">inferiority and hoped that they would be patient</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us and that they would overlook our multitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">of deficiencies. My wife concluded by presenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet with the store of books, which we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought with the hope that their perusal would</seg><seg type="columnLine">elucidate the difficulties which they must have in</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding such a complex system, or such com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexity with a lack of system, as existed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the conclusion of the simple ceremony, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">host outlined the social system of the Martians to us:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as the youth of Mars showed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural inclinations, they were trained along those</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines. On the completion of the training, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointed to a vacancy that was opened for them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there being no more prepared for a line of service</seg><seg type="columnLine">than it was shown that the branch could absorb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their advancement from this time on was gradual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until their period of service ended. The period of</seg><seg type="columnLine">service varied with the responsibility of the office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shortest being the term of those engaged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">executive positions; the longer of those engaged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tasks which required but little effort. The grading</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these tasks had been done scientifically, by actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">measurement of the amount of energy expended in</seg><seg type="columnLine">performing them. The product of the rate of en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ergy expenditure and a time factor, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">logarithmic, gave a constant quantity for all positions</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that of a simple machine operator to that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the President. In return for his labor, each member</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the community was provided with the necessities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life, according to the needs of his family. A state</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit was also given, which allowed him to indulge</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the luxuries the planet afforded. So highly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped were the Martians that they did not need</seg><seg type="columnLine">supervising; each man knew his duty and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done to the best of his ability; no shirkers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, nor had there been any for many ages. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">must not be thought that it was fear of punishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">that kept each man to his task, it was the knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was part of a smoothly working machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that it was only by the co-ordination of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole that he could live and enjoy the benefits the</seg><seg type="columnLine">system gave him and his millions of companions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This wonderful system had developed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity arising for the united efforts of the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the conservation of its water supply, as Lowell</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected and pointed out in his "Mars and Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canals." Let me quote him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "--Whether increasing common sense or increas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing necessity was the spur that drove the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this eminently sagacious state we cannot say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it is certain that reached it they have, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally certain that if they had not they must all</seg><seg type="columnLine">die. When a planet has attained to the age of</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing decrepitude, and the remnant of its water</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply resides simply in its polar caps, these can</seg><seg type="columnLine">only be effectively tapped for the benefit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants when arctic and equatorial peoples are</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one. Difference of policy on the question of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">all-important water supply means nothing short of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. Isolated communities cannot there be suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient unto themselves; they must combine to solidar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity or perish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The social and economic standing of every mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the community was the same. The birth rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet was stabilized in order to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">population well within the limiting number which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet could support, two to three children being</seg><seg type="columnLine">the number allowed each couple. Love and mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage, with its subsequent family, was the ideal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the race. Before mating, the applicants were sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected to the most rigorous tests before the union</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the couple was duly recorded. Seldom, indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it necessary for the applicants to be refused this</seg><seg type="columnLine">privilege and, once made, never was a union dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved. The tests, which were psychological and</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical, showed infallibly whether the union would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be satisfactory or not. Marriage took place at what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would consider an early age--as soon as both</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the union were mature, which corre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponded to an age of eighteen to twenty. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">women of Mars were much like the men, save for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more rounded limbs and slightly shorter stature. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">women were as active members of the planet's eco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomic life as were the men; they held the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">offices and incurred the same responsibilities, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only difference being that it was not usual for them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to assume these positions until their children were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer in need of them, for the early training</seg><seg type="columnLine">was entrusted to the mothers. The longevity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians surpassed that of the Jewish Methuselah,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an age of fourteen hundred years not being uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon. Sickness was unknown to them and death was</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually artificial, for on feeling the effects of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">age coming upon them, it was usual to go to one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the state institutions where they were painlessly put</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the long sleep that knows no waking. To some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us, this may seem cold-blooded, but on due con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideration. it appears to be the most humane pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cedure; to be a useless member of a community and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a parasite upon others is not an enjoyable state.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the conclusion of this outline, our host, who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we learned later, was no less a personage than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">President of Mars, conducted us to the upper story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vast pile, which formed the "Capitol"' of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, where the quarters which we were to occupy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been prepared for us. These had been sealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and supplied with compressors to keep the air at</seg><seg type="columnLine">our customary atmospheric pressure. Our supplies</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been removed from the space flyer and carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. We were hungry, so we were left to appease</seg><seg type="columnLine">our appetites, being directed to call our host when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ready to accompany him to the laboratories,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we had been asked to undergo an examina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion by a committee of scientists. Our meal finished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smythe went to the wall, turned an indicator as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been instructed, and informed our host that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ready. Donning our suits, we passed out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gallery through the air-lock, as directed. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes one of the numerous torpedo-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">aircraft that we saw speeding along the air lanes</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooped down and settled on the gallery. Our host,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was seated at the controls, invited us to enter. *</seg><seg type="columnLine">Briefly, the machine was described to us before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. Under the floor we were shown several cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders. about a foot long and four inches in diameter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to these w'ere connected heavy wires which led to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the driving and lifting mechanism. The latter con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained many heavy coils of wire, in a case supported</seg><seg type="columnLine">on two rails that were rigidly attached to the frame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of the machine over our heads. The source of</seg><seg type="columnLine">power was likened to electricity, but must not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">confused with that. On flowing through the coils,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a repulsive action was developed which drove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine upwards. Sliding on the two rails, the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainer so adjusted itself that the center of gravity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the machine was directly below it, thus accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modating itself for varytffg distribution of the loads</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine carried. A similar arrangement in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern served to propel the craft; this was mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a pivot which allowed the horizontal direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the driving thrust to be varied by the pilot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to steer the machine, while a second set of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coils in the bow served to retard and stop the car.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The power carried in the cylinders was enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive the machine at a speed of nine hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">per hour for thirty hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At my request, Hargraves inquired if the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians had not discovered how to transmit power by</seg><seg type="columnLine">wireless. They had, long ago, was the answer, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">its efficiency never reached a very high standard, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been abandoned, as everything inefficient was</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned, as soon as they discovered the source</seg><seg type="columnLine">of power they now used, which was practically one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred per cent efficient, compared with but six</seg><seg type="columnLine">per cent of the former.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We rose from the gallery as the operator turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dial, and then shot forward in a westerly direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, about half a mile above the city which shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">with wonderful beauty as the afternoon sun brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the bold but beautiful color schemes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">architecture. Continuing his description of the flyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its operation, our pilot informed us that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling of the machine was limited--above seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles the repulsive force was not enough to support</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--that was the reason another type had been devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oped for interplanetary work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a very short time we arrived at our destina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, covering the twenty-odd miles that separated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two buildings in four or five minutes. Alighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one of the ever-present galleries, we were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducted to a chamber in which eight Martians awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. I was the first "victim" and was led to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">antechamber, in the center of which was a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular platform. I was directed to stand on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform, facing a tall white screen. Behind me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to either side of me were circular batteries of lenses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">above and below which were arranged long narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes of a transparent medium in front of highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">polished reflectors of some greenish material. On a</seg><seg type="columnLine">table to the right of the screen were numerous in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struments whose use I could not begin to guess,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a piece of apparatus I did recognize--a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">conical pendulum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Directing me to remain motionless, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">committee took his stand at the table, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others crowded around the screen. 1 was suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed in a greenish glow and on the screen before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me there appeared an image of my figure as seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the front. Suddenly, the chest o'f my protect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing suit seemed to be sliced away in the figure, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flesh appeared, just as though a vertical slice</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been made through my clothing. Gradually, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">section plane cut deeper and deeper into my body</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the lungs, heart and stomach were shown in</seg><seg type="columnLine">section. It was a weird feeling to see oneself por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trayed thus, and it was all I could do to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RETURN OF THE MARTIANS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">81</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless. I could feel nothing, no more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">one feels the "X-ray," of which this was evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glorified example. In a few minutes the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed completely through me, exposing every</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiber and nerve of my body in its progress to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny of the watchers. At the end I was asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to step down and the operator went to the rear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen, reappearing with a number of sheets on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I caught a glimpse of my figure as it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared on the screen. For a few moments some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these, which had been singled out by the group,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were subjected to a careful scrutiny and discussion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then one of them turned to me and asked if I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to have corrected the various parts of my body</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were not functioning properly. I finally un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood his suggestion after several repetitions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On ascertaining that it would not take very long, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">assented and was then put into the hands of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">others who entered at some signal. The sheets were</seg><seg type="columnLine">given them and, after a brief discussion of my case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was led away into an adjoining room. Here I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid on a long white table, whose surface was cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with some soft smooth material and a metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamp was attached to each ankle and wrist. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once there seemed to be a snap in my brain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my consciousness reeled for a moment--at least so</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed--the bands were removed and I was di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected to arise. As I did so, I was astonished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find that my leg, which had troubled me ever since</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was unfortunate enough to run foul of a "five-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine" at Vimy Ridge, was as well as the other, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time I realized that my glasses had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed and that I could see far better than I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see with them. I was conducted back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Smythe and my wife were waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought you were never coming," said my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife. "What have they been doing with you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	told her, adding that I had not been gone for more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ten minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ten minutes! Look at your watch!" she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted. T looked at my wrist watch, which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapped outside the suit I wore. I had been gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly an hour and a half! That night, in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own apartments, I found several marks that looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like old scratches on my body. Yet I had never felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest sensation of the operations that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been performed on me. But from that time on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">several distressing symptoms that I had had for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time before, never bothered me again. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">surgery! T had been stripped, operated upon in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than six places and dressed, all in the short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time that I had been on the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a few minutes Hargraves appeared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was equally surprised to find how long he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">under that wonderful anesthetic. He, too, had "un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dergone repairs," as he called it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We now returned to the flyer, to find that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the control of another pilot, the President</seg><seg type="columnLine">having had an important call during our visit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratories. Our new pilot was one of the many</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had volunteered to instruct and entertain us dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing our visit. We were more than an hour in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning. for our guide took us all over the city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">explaining and pointing things out to us. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow, he promised us, he would show us some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of the great Martian irrigation system; he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having been a high official in the engineering depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. was assigned as our instructor in that subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That evening we watched the sunset from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">aerie and watched the rising of Phobos, the inner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moon of Mars. To an observer from the earth, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moons of Mars present surprising sights, for, poets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and non-scientific authors to the contrary, no heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enly bodies rise in the west to the inhabitants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. Yet here on Mars we watched the rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Phobos in the west, for, moving around its pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mary as it does, in about 7h. 39m., it moves faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the planet than the planet turns on its axis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rising in the west, it remains above the horizon</seg><seg type="columnLine">for about five and one-half hours; setting in the east</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reappear in a like interval in the west, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">through all its phases in eleven hours. Deimos, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer moon, was overhead at sundown. Here is an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other strange sight. The period of Deimos is 30h.</seg><seg type="columnLine">18m., hence he rises in the east, but remains above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizon for over two days. Phobos, the larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two moons, appears to have but one-fifth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diameter of the moon as seen from the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Deimos appears to be but one-twentieth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While we sat there watching the shades of eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning sweep over the city, there came an alarm from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the annunciator and we heard the President's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking to see us. He entered through the air-lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute later and seated himself at the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we were grouped. He said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was called away this afternoon to witness a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new discovery that has just been made. Discoveries</seg><seg type="columnLine">are now few and far between with us, and this latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been stimulated by the news of your intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit some weeks ago. It is a medical discovery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result of it is that we will now be able to visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">your earth with impunity. The discoverer has found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we can strengthen our bodies so that they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to withstand many times the pull of gravi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation to which they are subjected here; moreover</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drug so increases the resisting power of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body that no disease will affect it, as has been shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a subject who volunteered to try it on himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He has been proved to be immune from the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">virulent germs, cultures of which were injected into</seg><seg type="columnLine">him long enough ago to show definitely if they af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected him or not.

I wondered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I gazed out over the city, which was now lit as</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly as day, how long it would be before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would become as truly great as the Martians had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become, how long it would be before we would all</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to treat creatures which were as inferior to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us as we must be to the Martians with such kindness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with an apparent lack of condescension and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibition of superiority; truly the Martians were</seg><seg type="columnLine">great and more than worthy of emulation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">82</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE following day, we were conducted on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised tour of inspection of the "canals."</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had arisen early to see the Morning Star of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars, a brilliant, silvery white point of light in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern sky, accompanied by a fainter one close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It was hard to realize that this was our home</seg><seg type="columnLine">--over seventy million miles away. Our pilot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preceding afternoon arrived soon after we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished breakfast and we were whisked away at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, heading towards the northern polar cap.* Fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing the great circle course of the Dis, a broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt of cultivated territory running due north and</seg><seg type="columnLine">south, which is one of the seven larger "canals"</seg><seg type="columnLine">which spread fanwise northward from the Trivium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we sped north at the highest speed the machine could</seg><seg type="columnLine">attain. Three hours' flight brought us to the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fast melting cap and from aloft we could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole countryside inundated with water as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the eye could reach. We descended to within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few feet of its surface and our guide pointed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lateral and main ditches, which were fast carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the precious fluid to the great underground stor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age basins. Moving further north, we came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow cap itself and here the machine settled while</seg><seg type="columnLine">we got out and stretched our legs. It was mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">slush, and streams of water had in many places</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed the snow away, revealing the cap to be quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin. We were informed that the maximum amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of snow that fell was fifteen feet, while the average</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about ten. We returned to our machine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were then taken eastward to where a great rift</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed in the cap. This was the line of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canals and fresh vegetation was already springing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up under the rays of the early summer sun. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning the machine's nose southward, we proceeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the Utopia region and towards the "Wedge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Casius," the latter a great angular marking on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maps of the planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here we found a vast area under intensive cul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tivation : huge machines plowing, fertilizing and seed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the ground. On request, our pilot dropped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">until our machine rested on the top of a gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultivator below. We alighted and were conducted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the interior. The whole structure was vibrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hidden power as it moved forward at a speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of perhaps ten miles per hour. We were shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the control room, where the operator sat. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course we were at once recognized and. leaving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat, he greeted us, then conducted us below, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he explained the operation of the machine. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave it to guide itself for hours. The body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine was suspended about two feet above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level ground on endless caterpillar treads. The soil</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taken in forward by means of rotary scoops</seg><seg type="columnLine">after it had been loosened by the ploughshares;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was then carried to "digestors," which pulverized</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prepared it. Samples of the soil taken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">four points of the machine's seventy foot width</seg><seg type="columnLine">were carried to mechanical analyzers which con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuously determined the quantity and kind of fer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilizer required lo bring it up to perfection for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crops raised here, from which were obtained one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most important elements of their food supply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The analyzers then automatically regulated the sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply of the different fertilizers which were supplied</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the "digestors."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On leaving the machine, the soil was spread in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broad furrow from which it had been taken and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the process was completed by seeding and rolling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The work was carried on day and night at the rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of over three square miles a day for each machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of machines being engaged in the task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving the cultivator, we headed towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trivium once more, following a new "canal," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eunostos, from the point where it leaves the wedge</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Aquae Calidae, for several hundred miles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing Elysium and arriving "home" as the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">was setting, tired and hungry, for we had eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing since breakfast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The land is cultivated for widths from a few hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred yards to ten miles on either side of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">arteries of the planet, depending upon the size of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subterranean aqueduct. In the case of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger arteries, lateral pipelines convey the precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluid to the area under cultivation and the growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">that follows makes their course visible to the trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye at the other end of a good instrument under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best observing conditions on the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day we were shown the great under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground storage basins, hundreds of square miles iii</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent, where the precious fluid was sealed to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent loss by evaporation. With each of these vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">reservoirs were associated the pumping machinery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the system. We stood in awe under the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gigantic machines which would dwarf any</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly construction into insignificance, watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling metal shafts and the glittering piston rods</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they rose and fell, thudding out the heart beats</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet which sent its life blood coursing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through its artfiicial veins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day after day, during our twenty-seven day stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the planet, we were kept busily employed. I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, took the greatest interest in the astro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomical work of the planet and, with a machine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was placed at my disposal, I visited the principal</seg><seg type="columnLine">observatories of that world. How tiny even our</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge reflectors were, compared with the instruments</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	saw there. Imagine how I felt when I took my</seg><seg type="columnLine">place at the eyepiece of the giant of the giant re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flectors, with a mirror more than seven hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet across, more than seven thousand times the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-grasping power of the great Mt. Wilson re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flector. With the thin Martian air and its excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional clarity and steadiness, it was possible to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">observations with undreamed of powers, powers so</seg><seg type="columnLine">great that for the first time I saw stars as disks, tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">disks, it is true, but nevertheless, disks large enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some cases to see their photospheric disturbances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is impossible for us on the earth to see any star,</seg><seg type="columnLine">other than the sun, as a disk, due to the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, until the diameters, and hcnce the "resolving</seg><seg type="columnLine">power," of our instruments are greatly increased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the time for our departure drew near, a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">regret was felt by all of us, so much had the inward</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty of the Martians taken hold of us, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell that we were leaving a paradise. The one con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soling thought was, that we were not returning alone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with friends who, we felt sure, would soon be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to organize our woefully muddled world into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">world that would begin to approach the ideal we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had witnessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There seems no need for me to go into the details</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our return voyage or the surprise of the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the return of the Martians.

Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Koblischkc in the January issue claims that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridiculous; that human beings should ever evolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">into sexless automatons is biologically improb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, he thinks. The story states to the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Bi-chanifs and the, Tri-namics nropa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gated their species by fertilizing the female</seg><seg type="columnLine">ovum in ecto-genetic incubators till it was past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the embryonic stage of development. The young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bi-chanic or Tri-namic was then encased m a</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent cylinder. Finally, this led to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extinction of the female sex because it was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer necessary, then the whole race began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">die off. "The Machine Man of Ardathia" created</seg><seg type="columnLine">synthetically the equivalent of the female ovum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in ecto-genetic incubators developed it; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body after passing the embryonic stage was</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed in a transparent cylinder, as had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bi chanics and Tri-namics before them, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was also supplied with tubes furnishing it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary energy for rebuilding its body tissues,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was only a minor affair .due to the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of muscular activity carried on by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ardathian. Now. you see. sex was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">essential. An automaton defined is a machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled by some external agency having no</seg><seg type="columnLine">volition or cognizance of its own. The Ardathians</seg><seg type="columnLine">had both these attributes, wherefore call them</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatons! They still thought and reasoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat as humans do. They were not human,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were superhuman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ardathian was probably above most emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, as wc know them. Emotions didn't come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the reaction of their viscera, as it does in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our case. They were above . emotion, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it. for this reason: emotions arc traits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mammalia which have been developed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages of maternal protection. The extinction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sex among the Ardathians withdrew the maternal</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct and its influences eventually died out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, I don't see why this story should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded as fantastic or inconceivable. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's present tendency to rely upon machines to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do his work and even his thinking in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">eases, the gap between the human being and</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine is rapidly lessening in width, lliis is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great speculative field. The morbid vein in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the story runs is altogether fitting for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances.

So, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the writer is really picturing himself as a pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaser. let him think it over and see whether he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not needlessly disturbed. If he will study</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cover illustrations attentively, he will see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sometimes they arc very remarkable pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductions in the line of mcchanical detail. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">artist. Paul, who does many of them, has a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">special ability in the line of producing this class</seg><seg type="columnLine">of work, which most artists would find difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">or impossible.

Amazing Stories:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I have just been re-reading the Discussion Col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umns in the December issue of your magazine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I notice in it a letter from I. M. Lichtigman</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Brooklyn. In it lie speaks at length on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth Dimension and brings in an excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory about duration of light waves. But does</seg><seg type="columnLine">he know why time is considered the Fourth Di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mension? If not, I suggest that lie take a pencil</seg><seg type="columnLine">and draws a line with it on a sheet of paper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, if that line is to exist at all it must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, breadth and time, for, without this, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have been drawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As it is possible to travel in the three dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions that we know of, is there any plausible</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason why wc should not be able to travel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine? .Mr. Lichtigman speaks of a theory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duration of I.iglil Waves, but this may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing whatever to do with it. The idea about</seg><seg type="columnLine">time is that, once you have done something, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stays forever in a plane in time. This plane can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be traveled in just as any other plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As for the writer's few words on traveling into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the future they carry no weight at all. lie says</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, if nothing exists its picture cannot be made.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quite so. but how does he know that things in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the future do not already exist? When a blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">mail looks into a mirror he docs not see his</seg><seg type="columnLine">image, nor can he feel, hear, or smell it. There-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, I suppose, it docs not exist. This is all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his reasoning comes to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">My theory on Time-traveling is, that if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can Tiinc-travel, you are invisible and have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence. What would happen if you had? Take</seg><seg type="columnLine">one example. Suppose that 30 years ago, when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voting man, you had been the owner of a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and you were debating as to whether you</seg><seg type="columnLine">should add ail extension to your house or not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You wrote a letter to the builders but threw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, thinking better of your idea. Then you</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the Continent for a year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, if you can travel through Time and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence in the past, you coulago into the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">in safety and re write the letter, and send it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the builders. The extension is then built.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In the present time, then, a building will sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly arise out of the ground. But this is obvi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously ridiculous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Concerning the illustrations: Paul may be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good artist, but f am very glad that people do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have faces like those of some of the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his pictures. They are just as bad in The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Metal Emperor in Science and Invention. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">illustrations, by all means, but less of these faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">One word in conclusion, do not make Amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stories semi-monthly.

He had an immense head</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a straight forehead, at least seven inches high.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His light blue eyes were about two inches in diameter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and placed close together; moreover, they had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelously intelligent, as well as keen look in them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to describe. Their hypnotic gaze held</seg><seg type="columnLine">one spellbound and seemed to go clear through you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The long thin nose was enormous, but harmon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized well with the rest of the face; the complexion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was somewhat brown. The large ears stood out</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight and looked like enormous oyster shells, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inside turned towards me. I fowever, what caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eye particularly was the strange 'caps' all Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians wore. These caps looked as i f they were made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a flexible metal. From their back dangled what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1	thought to be a flexible metal wire. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon to know their purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The chest, or rather the torso of the Martians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was simply out of all proportion to the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. It was enormous, and made him look strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">top-heavy. His arms appeared thin and emaciated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as did his legs. His hands had each two thumbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and four fingers, the extra thumb being between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb and index finger, as compared to the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. The hand itself was very small; in fact, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked much like an Earth woman's hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The feet were almost circular in shape and meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured at least 18 inches in diameter. The base looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much like an elephant's foot, although the ankle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rather small and graceful, as compared to the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat foot. The outside of the Martian's dress glis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened strangely in the sunlight, and I felt sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must be made of a flexible metal, unknown to us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It fitted rather loosely and did not appear to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">much style. The upper part of the body was en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed in a sort of blouse, such as our young boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">wear on Earth. The trousers looked like knickers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that they extended down to the ankles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "While we were still gazing enraptured at these</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, marvelous beings, we suddenly became con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious that our brains were being filled with a won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful sort of music which seemed to originate inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">our heads. Instantly, the Martians who had stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">around in a haphazard manner, formed a lane, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">center of which was formed by ourselves. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one end we now perceived a colossal, bewildering</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure with a church-like appearance, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to turn around slowly on its axis. When its</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponderous portals, measuring at least 200 feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">height, had swung around so that they pointed in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, the structure ceased revolving. Immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately the portals slid back and out stepped a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguished looking Martian, taller even than his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers. He was dressed like them, except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his metallic cap appeared yellow in color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At a gesture, two Martians stepped toward us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, taking oft our headgear, replaced them with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft metallic caps. By this time the distinguished</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking Martian had come up close to us and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, only five feet away. He next placed the tips</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fingers of both hands to his temples, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we took to be a salute. We hastened to respond</seg><seg type="columnLine">likewise, but we must have executed the motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">poorly, for a faint, rather amused smile flitted over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brownish features of the august Martian. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned around and some attendants bade us with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a motion to follow the chief, which we did. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">then entered the church-like structure and we fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him deferentially.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Alier, my boy, I guess the telegraphone</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire must be almost full by this time.

The comet of the story always rises in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  east soon after sunset.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  2.	It is stated very clearly that the comet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "was swinging out again from the sun on its out-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ward journey into space."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  3.	It is also stated tip to the climax of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  story that the comet comes closer and closer to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now to consider these statements:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The action of the story would have been per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  fectly logical if the comet had not risen in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  cast every tiipht soon after sunset. To have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  done so it would have had to be already past the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  earth and far out into space, getting farther away</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  every day. Had it been traveling in the path</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ascribed to it, the comet would have either been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  high in the sky at sunset at the beginning of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  the story and farther toward the east each suc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  cessive night, as it passed the earth, or would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  have risen after midnight and earlier and earlier</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  until it reached the position in the story, de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  pending upon the direction it followed around</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  the sun.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice that the word SCIENT1 FICTION docs not</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear on the cov&lt;?r of the magazine at all. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 think that is a sad omission, because there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">many that are not familiar with Amazing Stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">and imagine it is a concoction of weird, eerie, hair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising thrillers, instead of a delightful set of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories based on scientific knowledge and fact. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am sure the latter impression is the one most de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sirable to cultivate. !!y all means do not consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing away with either the editorial page or with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discussions and the comments. I would also</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggest a page devoted to jokes of a scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature similar to the one conducted in Science</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Invention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1 will not commit myself as to which stories I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like or dislike as that is a matter of personal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">opinion.
