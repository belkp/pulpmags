Nu Yak, </p><p>die greatest monument man- </p><p>kind ever reared upon the face </p><p>of Earth, was dead. No creature of </p><p>flesh and blood moved along her thou- </p><p>sands of miles of multiple-tiered streets, </p><p>glanced appreciatively and pridefully </p><p>outward and downward through dizzy- </p><p>ing azure depths from the gleaming </p><p>pinnacles of her four-thousand-foot </p><p>towers, ‘strolled or lounged in her un- </p><p>kempt and silent parks. No silvery air- </p><p>"It was obvious to him now that these dead were </p><p>6 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>craft or fish-shaped strato-ships hurtled </p><p>purposely above her Himalayan sky- </p><p>line, no birds or insects sang or buzzed </p><p>in her wondrous hanging gardens. </p><p>Grass and weeds grew in crevices in her </p><p>disintegrating pedestrian walks, and fat </p><p>angle worms crawled unafraid through </p><p>their lush and fecund tangle. </p><p> Dry and chalk-white skeletons lit-</p><p>tered the streets—the skeletons of men </p><p>and women and children and birds and </p><p>domestic beasts. They strewed the dust- </p><p>carpeted corridors of great buildings; </p><p>they were even to be found—had any </p><p>sentient creature been there to search </p><p>for them—in the huge and hermetically </p><p>sealed gas shelters beneath the city. </p><p>The gas had lingered longer than the </p><p>men who had designed and built those </p><p>tremendous caverns had believed pos- </p><p>sible; thirst and oxygen starvation had </p><p>snuffed out lives the gas had not been </p><p>able to touch. </p><p> It was not only that way in Nu Yok</p><p>and in the Americas; it was the same </p><p>all over Earth. Even the yellow men, </p><p>big and little, who had first perfected </p><p>the gas and immediately deluged the </p><p>Americas with it in that last decade </p><p>of the Twenty-first Century, had also </p><p>perished. For the gas had been easy to </p><p>analyze, and easier to manufacture. </p><p>Dying, the Americas had struck back </p><p>at the yellow men with their own </p><p>weapon, and gasping doom had en- </p><p>circled the globe. All races of man- </p><p>kind, all air-breathing creatures, save </p><p>only the deep-sea fishes and the worms </p><p>that chanced to be far underground— </p><p>and, perhaps, a few toads and frogs, </p><p>encapsulated and dormant in dry lake </p><p>or river beds—had perished. </p><p> The last human creature had been</p><p>dead for over three years, and the last </p><p>bird or beast or insect for perhaps an </p><p>additional six months, when, at approx- </p><p>imately eleven o’clock in the morning </p><p>on June eighth, in the year—according </p><p>to occidental reckoning—two thousand </p><p>and ninety-seven, Thvall the Seeker </p><p>brought his fourteen-million ton neutro-</p><p>nium-hulled space-ship into Earth’s </p><p>atmosphere and, having already ob- </p><p>served Nu Yok’s towers and minarets </p><p>from half-way around the globe, set </p><p>her down as lightly as a drifting </p><p>feather in a cradle of granite rocks </p><p>near the southern boundary of that </p><p>rectangular stretch of greenery men </p><p>knew as Central Park. And, as he set </p><p>his ship down gently, careful to avoid </p><p>crushing the green vegetation, in </p><p>Thvall the Seeker’s curious soul there </p><p>was a great gladness. For Thvall knew </p><p>that his quest was ended. </p><p>IT had been a long and a lonely </p><p>search, spanning reaches of space </p><p>that light will not cross in twenty thou- </p><p>sand years. It had begun beyond the </p><p>hub of our stellar galaxy, and the years </p><p>of Thvall’s journeying were to the life </p><p>of a man as the age of the Pyramids is </p><p>to a single day. ' </p><p> Spawn of the innermost planet of a</p><p>blue-white dwarf sun deep hidden in </p><p>the globular cluster in Messier II, </p><p>Thvall resembled in no way save one </p><p>any of the diversified forms of life </p><p>which have evolved upon Earth down </p><p>the millenniums since the red heat died </p><p>from her surface rocks and permitted </p><p>her seas to form. Because of that sin- </p><p>gle resemblance Thvall had begun his </p><p>search; only because of it had he finally </p><p>arrived upon Earth. </p><p> Water! Thvall, like a man, required</p><p>water. The mechanical processes of </p><p>his existence, and of the existence of </p><p>his kind, depended upon an unfailing </p><p>supply of water. And upon Thvall’s </p><p>home world the water was almost </p><p>gone---- </p><p> Thvall well knew, when he began his</p><p>THE RED GOD LAUGHED </p><p>7 </p><p>quest, the odds against his succeeding. </p><p>To every hundred thousand suns there </p><p>was but one, and perhaps not even one, </p><p>with planets. To every thousand </p><p>planets perhaps, perhaps there was one </p><p>sufficiently supplied with water—and </p><p>suitable for colonization by his kind. </p><p>There were a hundred million chances </p><p>to one of Thvall's finding, anywhere in </p><p>the galaxy, that which he sought. And </p><p>the other galaxies, even the big, near </p><p>one in Andromeda, were too far </p><p>away. . . . </p><p> And now the quest was ended.</p><p> Thvall’s selection of Sol as a star</p><p>worthy of investigation had not been </p><p>haphazard. While still beyond the </p><p>white star Alpha in the constellation of </p><p>the Centaur he had noted that this </p><p>modest yellow-white sun was slightly </p><p>unstable, slightly variable, a star that </p><p>fluctuated, though to only a minor de- </p><p>gree, through a regularly recurrent </p><p>cycle. </p><p> That periodicity might mean al-</p><p>most anything; it might mean that </p><p>the star was on the verge of blowing </p><p>up, it might be caused by the resultant </p><p>of the gravitational attraction of at- </p><p>tendant planets, or it might be merely </p><p>the subsiding spasms of some ancient </p><p>solar malaise. From Alpha Centauri, </p><p>Thvall set his course for Sol. </p><p> He was fifteen billions of miles be-</p><p>yond the orbit of that planet men have </p><p>named Pluto when the steadily increas- </p><p>ing intensity of Sol’s illumination, actu- </p><p>ating certain mechanisms, awakened </p><p>him from the state of completely sus- </p><p>pended animation in which he voyaged </p><p>from star to star. He awoke instantly, </p><p>feeling neither refreshed nor ener- </p><p>vated, and lacking any recollection </p><p>whatsoever of the passage of time. His </p><p>first, and almost automatic activity, was </p><p>to reduce the velocity of his space-craft </p><p>from a hyper-Einsteinian, interstellar </p><p>speed to a pace more suitable to inter- </p><p>planetary cruising. </p><p> During those first brief, waking mo-</p><p>ments his ship traveled Solward a bil- </p><p>lion miles. </p><p> Immediately he had slowed the rush</p><p>of his ship toward the yellow sun, he </p><p>applied himself to his instruments, and </p><p>saw at once that the slightly nervous </p><p>star was plagued with a swarm of </p><p>planets. The outermost planets were </p><p>too cold to support life; their atmos- </p><p>pheres were raging seas of ammonia </p><p>and methane. The planet nearest the </p><p>luminary’ was without atmosphere; the </p><p>next was heavily blanketed with an at- </p><p>mosphere, which was, however, full of </p><p>carbon dioxide; the third planet—the </p><p>one with the pear-shaped moon—had </p><p>an atmosphere dripping with water- </p><p>vapor. </p><p> Thvall, looking upon Earth, knew</p><p>that his quest was ended. </p><p>HIS ship safely landed on Sol’s third </p><p>planet, Thvall began a series of </p><p>routine tasks. He analyzed the lumi- </p><p>nary’s radiation and the planet’s atmos- </p><p>phere with highly encouraging results; </p><p>his kind could adapt themselves to life </p><p>on Earth. Next he attempted commu- </p><p>nication with the green growing life, </p><p>but, although he quickly learned that </p><p>Earth’s vegetation possessed a dim, </p><p>vague consciousness, it was obvious that </p><p>its intelligence was too meager, too in- </p><p>stinctive for the development of orig- </p><p>inal thought. Obviously Earth’s vege- </p><p>tation could not have constructed the </p><p>aimless sprawling city in the midst of </p><p>which Thvall’s space-ship lay. It was </p><p>probable therefore that the city’s crea- </p><p>tors were temporarily absent. Perhaps </p><p>they were nocturnal creatures, who </p><p>lived during the day in underground </p><p>recesses and came to the surface of the </p><p>planet only at night. Perhaps they </p><p>8 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>were migratory. There were any num- </p><p>ber of plausible explanations of their </p><p>absence. </p><p> His preliminary scrutiny of the im-</p><p>mediate environment satisfactorily con- </p><p>cluded—and no motile form of Earth- </p><p>life having yet appeared to inspect his </p><p>ship, attempt communication with him </p><p>or perhaps dispute his peaceful inva- </p><p>sion of the planet—Thvall determined </p><p>to inspect one of the buildings which </p><p>towered skyward only a quarter of a </p><p>mile away, to the southward. Pru- </p><p>dently burdening himself with a variety </p><p>of apparatus and weapons, which he </p><p>distributed among several of his </p><p>smaller tentacles, he emerged through </p><p>the airlock in his ship’s hull and crawled </p><p>rapidly and with a slight tingling of </p><p>anticipation toward the nearest of the </p><p>buildings. </p><p> He had proceeded only a short dis-</p><p>tance when he came upon a bleached </p><p>mass of human bones, half hidden in </p><p>the rank grass. Examining them, he </p><p>realized at once that they had lived, </p><p>but—as his own amorphous race lacked </p><p>rigid skeletal structure of any sort, and </p><p>any conception of motile life being </p><p>hampered by rigidity was alien to him </p><p>—he had difficulty in imagining what </p><p>the creature had been like in life. He </p><p>concluded that it had been nowhere </p><p>near as motile as himself—perhaps </p><p>little more motile than the vegetation. </p><p> He also noted, however, and with</p><p>considerable approval, a number of </p><p>fat gray earthworms, and he paused </p><p>and attempted to communicate with </p><p>them, quickly discovering, however, </p><p>that, though they knew fear and hun- </p><p>ger, they were incapable of abstract </p><p>thought. </p><p> Continuing onward, he ascended a</p><p>long ramp which debouched upon a </p><p>broad street. On the opposite side of </p><p>the street the buildings began. The </p><p>street was littered with a large number </p><p>of small, egg-shaped wheeled mechan- </p><p>isms. Examining one of these through</p><p>its windows of fused silica and metal- </p><p>lic oxides, Thvall saw that it contained </p><p>two skeletons. </p><p> It was obvious to him now that these</p><p>dead were of the species which had </p><p>built the city. Why were they dead? </p><p>And had all of their kind throughout </p><p>the city perished? Or were some left </p><p>alive? </p><p> Uneasily Thvall, who realized only</p><p>too well that the unknown doom which </p><p>had snuffed out this bony form of </p><p>Earth-life might also be inimical to </p><p>himself, paused and made additional </p><p>tests. Reassurance of a sort returned </p><p>to him as he determined that Earth’s </p><p>atmosphere w’as remarkably stable and </p><p>that there were no electrical or atomic </p><p>mechanisms operating within the field </p><p>of his apparatus. Nevertheless, he de- </p><p>termined to proceed with extreme wari- </p><p>ness. </p><p> Crossing the broad street, Thvall</p><p>approached the base of the nearest </p><p>building and examined as much of the </p><p>interior as he could see through the </p><p>dusty though still partly transparent </p><p>windows. The structure was internally </p><p>subdivided into many small cubicles </p><p>profusely equipped with furnishings </p><p>which were, for the most part, incom- </p><p>prehensible to Thvall: he would have </p><p>to see those objects in use before he </p><p>could understand their purpose. </p><p> His bulk was too great to permit him</p><p>to enter through any of the windows, </p><p>but there were large doors which, after </p><p>a brief examination, he easily opened. </p><p>Entering the building, he found himself </p><p>in a chamber of considerable size, </p><p>which, like the smaller cells, was lux- </p><p>uriously furnished. The walls of this </p><p>room were profusely paneled with mir- </p><p>rors, which created the illusion of a </p><p>THE RED GOD LAUGHED </p><p>9 </p><p> chamber twice as large as actuality;</p><p> why this illusion should be necessary</p><p> or even desirable was utterly beyond</p><p> Thvall’s comprehension. Reflecting</p><p> surfaces in utter dissociation with any</p><p> recognizable form of apparatus what-</p><p> soever were a complete enigma to him.</p><p> The floor of this chamber was littered</p><p> with no less than twenty skeletons.</p><p> Some were still partly clothed in gar-</p><p> ments of vegetable, mineral and animal</p><p> fiber; some wore loose-fitting circlets</p><p> of metallic alloys around their tinier</p><p> appendages; many of the circlets held</p><p> geometrically carved bits of crystal-</p><p> lized carbon in claw-like sockets. Lift-</p><p> ing and examining a small, glass-dialed</p><p> mechanism which lay beside one of the</p><p> skeletons, Thvall discovered that it was</p><p> operated by an internal spring which</p><p> had, however, lost its tension; he re-</p><p> t wound the spring by turning a ratcheted</p><p> pin provided for the purpose, and dis-</p><p> covered that the mechanism produced</p><p> a regular pulsation, while three small</p><p> indicators beneath a transparent por-</p><p> tion of the mechanism’s shell revolved</p><p> at proportionate though greatly dis-</p><p> similar velocities. Correctly assuming</p><p> that the mechanism was a device for</p><p> measuring the passage of time, Thvall</p><p> replaced the watch beside the skeleton</p><p> of its owner and glided toward the</p><p> deeper recesses of the chamber.</p><p> Here he discovered a number of</p><p> doors arranged in an orderly row, and,</p><p> investigating one which was not fully</p><p> closed and which slid open easily, he</p><p> found that it opened upon a chimney-</p><p> like well. Within the well were a num-</p><p> ber of taut steel cables, which sup-</p><p> ported a square metal cage at a level</p><p> slightly beneath the door. Thvall had</p><p> opened the cage, Thvall saw at once,</p><p> was designed to be raised and lowered</p><p> from level to level of the building. Far</p><p>above, a tiny pinpoint of brilliant light </p><p>told Thvall that the well extended to </p><p>the top of the building; he instantly </p><p>determined to ascend the shaft and </p><p>view the city from that vantage-point. </p><p> He squirmed up the elevator shaft</p><p>like a gargantuan knot of writhing ser- </p><p>pents, and, reaching the elevator </p><p>motors, squeezed upward past them </p><p>and into a small, many-windowed </p><p>chamber. Here an iron door provided </p><p>egress to the roof of the building. </p><p>Thvall opened the door and squirmed </p><p>through. </p><p> On the roof of the building, in the</p><p>clean, sharp sunlight, Thvall put down </p><p>his instruments and weapons and se- </p><p>dately capered. This world was so </p><p>fair, so bountiful—and, as yet, so un- </p><p>developed ! There was no doubt now </p><p>that its ruling race were exceedingly </p><p>primitive, but they possessed intelli- </p><p>gence of a sort, too; if they proved </p><p>peaceable and friendly Thvall’s people </p><p>could teach them so much—so much! </p><p>—in return for a bit of the planet’s </p><p>desert land and a single lake of water. </p><p>Probably the first boon Thvall’s kind </p><p>would confer upon this world’s people </p><p>would be conquest of the plague which </p><p>had slain this city's inhabitants. Yes, </p><p>that would certainly be done first. . . . </p><p> The roof on which Thvall stood was</p><p>flat, and surrounded by a low parapet. </p><p>It was encumbered by only two objects, </p><p>the small structure which housed the </p><p>elevator motors and a huge torpedo- </p><p>shaped, steel cylinder which lay near a </p><p>corner of the parapet. Some of the </p><p>parapet bricks were broken, and there </p><p>was a long, dull scar on the roof. Ob- </p><p>viously the cylinder had been dropped </p><p>from a low altitude, had struck the </p><p>parapet a glancing blow, and had then </p><p>slithered across the roof. </p><p> What was the thing, and why had it</p><p>been dropped 011 this roof? </p><p>10 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>HHhvall slowly circled the object, </p><p>-*■ scrutinizing it intently. He saw that, </p><p>except for a short stubby rod protrud- </p><p>ing from its pear-shaped nose, it was </p><p>utterly without external moving parts </p><p>of any kind. But the rod looked like a </p><p>control of some sort. Thvall first ro- </p><p>tated the rod; then, when nothing hap- </p><p>pened, he tugged on it, and finally </p><p>pressed on it. That brought results. </p><p>The rod moved inward easily, and in- </p><p>stantly four small valves opened in the </p><p>cylinder’s circumference and a thick </p><p>gray gas poured forth and mingled </p><p>with the atmosphere. </p><p> For an instant Thvall hunched there</p><p>motionless, watching the gas ooze vis- </p><p>cidly from the metal cylinder and van- </p><p>ish in the clean, still air. Then, in a </p><p>lightning-flash of utter comprehension, </p><p>he understood the whole cryptic pat- </p><p>tern—the silent city, the dead every- </p><p>where, the significance of the gas-bomb </p><p>that was now pouring its lethal fumes </p><p>into the surrounding atmosphere. In- </p><p>stantly he darted for the open door </p><p>and the elevator shaft. . . . </p><p> He never reached that gaping well.</p><p>He detected no odor; there was no </p><p>warning pain, but abruptly the flat roof </p><p>was heaving and billowing like a swirl- </p><p>ing sea. </p><p> Vertigo danced in his alien brain,</p><p>an intense blackness deepened before </p><p>his single, thousand-faceted eye, and </p><p>strength and life went swiftly together </p><p>from his boneless tentacles. </p><p> Thus Thvall the Seeker died, and</p><p>the knowledge that on Earth — the </p><p>third planet of a minor sun deep sunk </p><p>in the thinning haze of stars twenty </p><p>thousand light-years beyond the gal- </p><p>axy’s axis — were the environmental </p><p>conditions and the water his people re- </p><p>quired so desperately, died with him. </p><p>And on Earth the frogs and fishes were </p><p>now the highest remaining forms of </p><p>sentient life. </p><p> But Mars, the Red God, laughed—</p><p>for though on Earth the men who had</p><p>deified him and honored him with a </p><p>name no longer lived to speak that </p><p>name, he had just claimed his last and </p><p>perhaps his most significant, sacrifice. </p><p> T® • •</p><p>rmities </p><p>By EDGAR DANIEL KRAMER </p><p>1 hree goldfishes in a bowl, </p><p>Three goldfinches in a cage, </p><p>Three lonely women with their dreams, </p><p>Afraid of Death and limping Age. </p><p>A broken bowl, an open cage, </p><p>Some feathers and a bit of bone, </p><p>An empty house and three new graves </p><p>Marked with three slabs of ghostly stone. </p><p>11 </p><p> usette</p><p>By SEABURY QUINN </p><p>An intriguing weird tale of the French Revolution—a romantic and appeal- </p><p>ing story that begins under the shadow of the guillotinef by the </p><p>author of “Roads” and “The Phantom Farmhouse” </p><p>12 </p><p>SUSETTE </p><p>13 </p><p>1. Rain Falls in the Rue des Fenetres </p><p>A SUDDEN spattering splash of </p><p>rain came sifting through the </p><p>almost naked branches of the </p><p>old horse-chestnut trees as Mordecai </p><p>Westhorne turned from the boulevard </p><p>into the Rue des Fenetres. He bent his </p><p>head against the coming storm and hur- </p><p>ried toward his lodgings, eager for </p><p>their warmth and quiet, for a chance to </p><p>rest, eager for the sight of things which </p><p>would remind him of America and san- </p><p>ity. </p><p> He needed reassurance that the</p><p>world had not gone utterly insane, that </p><p>there were places where men lived and </p><p>went about their business with the fear </p><p>of God before their eyes but with no </p><p>fear of men gnawing their brains like </p><p>canker-worms in festering fruit. For </p><p>this was Paris, in October—V end emi- </p><p>aire, according to the Revolutionary </p><p>calendar—and the guillotine — the </p><p>14 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>dreaded “chopper”—had been busy all </p><p>day long. </p><p> On his way back from his bureau by</p><p>the waterfront he had passed the tum- </p><p>brils, eight of them, bumping heavily </p><p>across the filthy flints on their way to </p><p>the scaffold set in the Place de la Revo- </p><p>lution, and the milling, jostling, scream- </p><p>ing, cursing, bestial-diroated crowd had </p><p>caught him up and bome him like a </p><p>chip dropped in the brook right to the </p><p>line of civil guards that ringed the place </p><p>of execution. The sight was sickening, </p><p>but fascinating. He wished to look </p><p>away, to shut his eyes, or hide them </p><p>with his hands, but he could no more </p><p>forbear staring at the chopper’s grisly </p><p>work than die charmed bird can avert </p><p>its eyes from the approaching serpent. </p><p> Sanson—“Monsieur de Paris'’—was</p><p>in charge, and with him his full crew of </p><p>*valets” in their crimson smocks, and </p><p>the three knocks sounded swifdy, rhyth- </p><p>mically, like the ricking of some mon- </p><p>ster clock of doom—the slapping knock </p><p>of the long plank to which the valets </p><p>strapped the victim prone, the clack of </p><p>wood on wood as the neckpiece was ad- </p><p>justed, then the thud that sounded as </p><p>the chopper fell. Two—four—a score </p><p>—two score and ten and six victims </p><p>strapped face-downward to the plank, </p><p>their necks latched in the pillory, then </p><p>the thumping of the dropping blade. A </p><p>pile of twitching corpses, gaping necks </p><p>cascading blood, fifty-six heads in the </p><p>baskets; the scaffold and the plank, even </p><p>the side-posts with the grooves in which </p><p>the chopper slid, reeking, splashed and </p><p>steamed with gore. And accompanying </p><p>the carnival of death the yells and </p><p>howls of obscene laughter from the </p><p>mob that gathered around the scaffold </p><p>like patrons at a comedy. </p><p> Mordecai was almost fainting when</p><p>the orgy finally ended, and fought his </p><p>way through the dispersing crowd with </p><p>desperate roughness. Even now the </p><p>memory of the grisly spectacle struck at </p><p>his stomach like an ice-cold blade, and </p><p>despite the rising storm he stopped to</p><p>lean against the wall and drink the cold </p><p>air in with shuddering gasps. He was </p><p>sick of Paris, sick of France, eager </p><p>with a longing almost past endurance </p><p>for the cleanness of New England and </p><p>the freedom of America. </p><p> The spell of nauseating weakness</p><p>passed and he bent his shoulders to the </p><p>rain which now came clown in almost </p><p>drowning torrents. As he plodded </p><p>through the storm his resolution </p><p>strengthened. He had a job of work to </p><p>do, and he would do it. England's </p><p>cruisers had swept the French ships </p><p>from the seas and, desperate for im- </p><p>ports, France had opened her West </p><p>Indian ports to neutral traders. New </p><p>England skippers and shipowners were </p><p>not backward in response, and a bridge </p><p>of Yankee clippers carried cinnamon </p><p>and coffee, sugar, rum, vanilla and to- </p><p>bacco from Martinique and Haiti to </p><p>the ports of France, returning to their </p><p>home docks with choice wines, louisine </p><p>and kindred luxuries. Foremost in the </p><p>fleet of carriers were the ships of West- </p><p>home &amp; Sons, shipowners of Boston, </p><p>and while old Ezekiel Westhorne su- </p><p>pervised the trade, and his sons Heze- </p><p>kiah, Obadiah and Micah sailed the </p><p>clippers, Mordecai, the youngest, was </p><p>in Paris as their representative, bar- </p><p>gaining with shippers, supervising re- </p><p>turn loads, seeing that prompt pay- </p><p>ments were made in good hard louts </p><p>and not in paper assignats. The West- </p><p>horne fortune increased steadily, and </p><p>he was here to help it grow. He hated </p><p>Paris, loathed the Frenchmen and </p><p>longed for home until the longing hurt, </p><p>but the family must be represented. </p><p>French frugality—to use no harsher </p><p>term—must be met with Yankee </p><p>SUSETTE </p><p>15 </p><p>shrewdness, again to use no harsher </p><p>term. Even as he swore to pack his </p><p>boxes and set sail for Boston when the </p><p>Mary Piper next heaved anchor from </p><p>the harbor of Bordeaux, he knew that </p><p>he would stay till need for him in </p><p>France was passed. </p><p> Through the drumming of the rain</p><p>drops and the skirling of the storm </p><p>wind came a cry, sharp and shrill as </p><p>pain, quavering as mortal terror: “Au </p><p>secours, pour I’amour de Dieu-” </p><p>The screamed appeal rose secant as a </p><p>naked knife-blade, then stopped quite </p><p>abruptly, held for eternity at its top </p><p>note, as if the screamer had been throt- </p><p>tled in mid-scream. </p><p>7\4"ordecai looked up, eyes narrowed </p><p>to the rain. A hundred feet away </p><p>two figures, blurred in the driving </p><p>storm, struggled with a third, and even </p><p>as he sighted them he saw them drop </p><p>a cloak or blanket over it and raise it </p><p>between them as if it were a sack of </p><p>meal or bale of merchandise. </p><p> Like everyone in Paris who was not</p><p>armed with sword or knife or pistol, </p><p>Mordecai bore an “executive author- </p><p>ity”—a loaded blackthorn stick two </p><p>inches thick and three feet long, se- </p><p>cured to his wrist by a thong of raw- </p><p>hide. “Halte-la!” he shouted as he </p><p>charged against the leveled lances of </p><p>the rain. “What goes on here?’-' </p><p> They met his onslaught with a coun-</p><p>tercharge. Dropping their quarry to </p><p>the walk unceremoniously, they sepa- </p><p>rated, one to the right, one left, and </p><p>rushed at him, one with a cutlas, the </p><p>other with a nine-inch dirk. </p><p> The sworded ruffian hacked a chop-</p><p>ping blow at Mordecai. Had he used </p><p>his cudgel as a guard the steel would </p><p>have cleft through it, but he was no </p><p>amateur with either quarterstaff or </p><p>sword, and as the cutlas descended he </p><p>dodged, swung back his stick and struck</p><p>down savagely. The loaded bludgeon </p><p>caught the poorly tempered blade mid- </p><p>way between the point and hilt and </p><p>snapped it short, as if it were an icicle. </p><p> “Pardithe devil’s in his elbow!”</p><p>swore the disarmed footpad. “Upon </p><p>him, Jacques! Give him the coup de </p><p>Pere Frangois!” The loaded stick </p><p>swung again and he dropped to the </p><p>brick footwalk, blood streaming from </p><p>his ears and nostrils. </p><p> The other bravo was not idle. Even</p><p>as he struck the swordsman with his </p><p>cudgel Mordecai felt himself seized </p><p>from behind. An arm was round his </p><p>neck, a dagger flashed, he felt a blow </p><p>above his heart that all but drove the </p><p>breath from him. </p><p> Had it not been for the great care</p><p>which Aunt Deborah Hastings took for </p><p>all her nephews’ souls’ welfare, he </p><p>would have felt nothing, for the dagger </p><p>had a needle-point and was driven by </p><p>the hand of one skilled in assassination. </p><p>But before he left for Paris Aunt De- </p><p>borah presented him with a small vol- </p><p>ume of religious exercises, “Gems of </p><p>Devotional Poetry for Occasional and </p><p>Daily Use by the Rev. Japheth Higgin- </p><p>botham, M.A.,” and made him promise </p><p>he would keep it always with him while </p><p>he stayed in the Gomorrah of the mod- </p><p>ern world. Mordecai’s New England </p><p>conscience would not let him break his </p><p>promise; so into the breast pocket of </p><p>his coat the Reverend Master Higgin- </p><p>botham’s compilation of atrocious verse </p><p>was thrust each morning when he set </p><p>out for the office. It contained a hun- </p><p>dred and twelve pages and was bound </p><p>in full morocco and—as wickedness </p><p>had aforetime met its master in the </p><p>hard, uncompromising faith of old </p><p>New England, so was the murderous </p><p>dagger-point stopped by Master Hig- </p><p>ginbotham’s poetry tonight. </p><p>16 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> With a quick bend Mordecai lunged</p><p>forward, put his hands behind his neck </p><p>and grappled with the rascal straddling </p><p>his back. One who’d tussled with the </p><p>toughest of the young roughs Boston’s </p><p>waterfront produced knew every hold, </p><p>fair and unfair, the wrestler’s art could </p><p>boast, and the would-be assassin cata- </p><p>pulted to the pavement with a force </p><p>that sent him slithering across the wet </p><p>bricks, brought him up against a house- </p><p>wall with a thud, and left him lying as </p><p>inert as was his broken-headed com- </p><p>panion. </p><p> “Citizen, are you unhurt?” asked</p><p>Mordecai as he turned toward the per- </p><p>son in the blanket. </p><p> The square of sopping cloth moved</p><p>like an alligator wakening to sluggish </p><p>life, and a face peered at him from an </p><p>upraised corner. “They are gone, Citi- </p><p>zen?” asked a girl’s voice; then, as she </p><p>saw him standing alone over her: “Do </p><p>not make yourself anxious for me. I </p><p>am of the good health.” The blanket </p><p>slipped away and she rose nimbly, un- </p><p>assisted, ancl looked at him through </p><p>dripping light-brown curls. </p><p> “La, la” her laughter trilled deli-</p><p>ciously, “we be a sorry-looking pair of </p><p>mortals, you and I. Mon—Citizen. You </p><p>are as wet as any drowned rat, and I </p><p>must look like some old beldame </p><p>ducked for scolding! Will not you </p><p>come with me and dry yourself? My </p><p>house is not so far away.” </p><p> Mordecai bowed stiffly, with such</p><p>dignity as he could muster while rivu- </p><p>lets of water ran from sleeves and </p><p>boots and collar. To be laughed at </p><p>when one has saved a damsel in dis- </p><p>tress! “1 shall take no illness from </p><p>my wetting, Citizeness,” he answered, </p><p>“but perhaps it were as well I wTalked </p><p>with you. You may meet with other </p><p>rascals in the street, and find help less </p><p>conveniently near.” </p><p> She made a little growling noise</p><p>deep in her throat, as one who mocks a </p><p>harmless puppy’s show of fierceness;</p><p>then, as he offered no response, she </p><p>tucked her small hand in the crook of </p><p>his elbow and fell in step with him as </p><p>demurely as a Boston maid upon her </p><p>way to Sabbath worship. </p><p>rpHEY came to halt before the wicket </p><p>■gate of a walled garden, and she </p><p>fished a little key from the reticule </p><p>dangling at her wrist. “Entrez vous, </p><p>s’il vous plait, et soyez le bienvenu” </p><p>She took her dripping skirts between </p><p>her thumbs and forefingers, lifted them </p><p>an inch or so and bobbed him a. small </p><p>curtsy. </p><p> He hesitated for a moment, then</p><p>bowed acknowlegdment of her invita- </p><p>tion. </p><p> Three times she rapped upon the</p><p>white door of the little house, waited </p><p>for a breath, then rapped twice more. </p><p>A shuffling step came from behind the </p><p>portal and a candle’s glow quickened </p><p>in the side-lights by the door as the </p><p>handle turned and the panels swung a </p><p>scant six inches back to reveal a pair of </p><p>bright, black, mouse-small eyes in an </p><p>incredibly wrinkled face. </p><p> “Ma cherie, ma pauvre, ma petite!”</p><p>croaked the aged portress. “Grace a </p><p>Dieu, you have returned! I thought </p><p>you had been lost, drowned in the rain, </p><p>or, worse, that they had come upon </p><p>you!” </p><p> “S-s-sh, Marjotte, not so loud!” the</p><p>girl bade softly. “Let us in, and </p><p>quickly, then light the fire and brew </p><p>some chocolate for the Citizen. He </p><p>is wet unto the skin-” </p><p> “How of yourself, my little one; you</p><p>too are doused,” the old woman pro- </p><p>tested. “Let Marjotte get you dry </p><p>clothing-” </p><p> “Zut! I can attend my own wants.</p><p>SUSETTE </p><p>17 </p><p>Do you light th'e fire and set the choco- </p><p>late pot to boiling.” </p><p> “B’en, Mam’selle,” the servant an-</p><p>swered, and preceded Mordecai into </p><p>the tiny drawing-room, where she knelt </p><p>before the logs piled ready in the fire- </p><p>place, set the tinder glowing and blew </p><p>upon the kindling till the little orange </p><p>flames curled upward cheerily. With a </p><p>taper she set candles flickering in wall </p><p>sconces and on the table, then with the </p><p>merest intimation of a curtsy left him </p><p>to his own devices. </p><p> The smoke steamed from his gar-</p><p>ments as he stood before the blaze, </p><p>turning slowly round and round to dry </p><p>himself on all sides, and as he felt the </p><p>cheerful glow draw out the wetness </p><p>from his clothes he took stock of the </p><p>room. It was not large, but it was very </p><p>elegant. The floor was spread with </p><p>Bruxelles carpet, light-taupe in shade; </p><p>the walls were pale cream, set with </p><p>cameo-like plaques of delft-blue with </p><p>white figures imposed on them. At the </p><p>windows hung long drapes of gold and </p><p>chamois-colored velvet. The mantel- </p><p>piece was white marble, the little clock </p><p>upon it ormolu. There was a sofa in </p><p>Etruscan style, mahogany inlaid with </p><p>bronze, chairs in Roman design. A </p><p>gilded harpsichord stood near the cen- </p><p>ter of the room. Books, too: Homer’s </p><p>Odyssey, Virgil’s Aeneid, the plays of </p><p>Aristophanes and the witty comedies of </p><p>Beaumarchais, all bound in carved and </p><p>gilded leather. </p><p> “Pardonnez-moi, Monsieur — Citi-</p><p>zen—I hope I have not kept you wait- </p><p>ing overlong,” he heard her voice from </p><p>the doorway. He had formed no esti- </p><p>mate of her in soaking bonnet and rain- </p><p>bedraggled dress; now, as she stood </p><p>framed in the door, her skin aglow </p><p>with vigorous toweling, he took a half- </p><p>step forward and involuntarily drew in </p><p>his breath. Unlike most French women </p><p>he had seen, she was fair, with very </p><p>fine and silky hair the color of a frosted </p><p>chestnut-burr. She wore it rather long, </p><p>parted in the middle and draped in lit-</p><p>tle curls each side her face, piled in a </p><p>small Psyche-knot at back, and he knew </p><p>her ringlets owed no debt to crimping- </p><p>irons. Ten minutes earlier they had </p><p>been wet as if dipped in the Seine, and </p><p>there had been no time to curl them. </p><p>Her little face was as arresting as an </p><p>interrogation point, triangular, with </p><p>high cheek-bones and generous mouth </p><p>and eyes a pale and smoky gray. Un- </p><p>usual eyes he thought them, large, </p><p>heavy-fringed, languishing and passion- </p><p>ate, a little frightened-seeming, rather </p><p>pleading in expression even when she </p><p>smiled. And she was smiling now as </p><p>with a noiseless tread she crossed the </p><p>pale-taupe carpet and extended a slim </p><p>hand. </p><p> “Mon sauveur” she told him in a</p><p>softly husky voice. “Bienfaiteur. To </p><p>you I owe a debt I cannot ever pay, no, </p><p>not even with the eyes of the head!” </p><p> He took the little hand in his and,</p><p>a trifle self-consciously, raised it to his </p><p>lips, then as he stepped back, made </p><p>quick appraisal of her. Her gown was </p><p>china silk, loosely draped from a high </p><p>waist, and so sheer and clinging that it </p><p>seemed to follow every curve of her </p><p>slight figure. The sash that bound it </p><p>just below the bosom was a three-yard </p><p>length of pale-rose ribbon tied "en </p><p>coquette” below the shoulders and trail- </p><p>ing in fringed ends almost to her dress </p><p>hem at the back. Save for the small </p><p>gold rings that scintillated in her ears </p><p>she wore no jewelry. As he straight- </p><p>ened from his bow he saw her feet </p><p>were stockingless and shod with sandals </p><p>fastened with cross-straps of purple </p><p>grosgrain laced about her ankles. Bible- </p><p>trained from infancy, Mordecai’s mind </p><p>echoed with a stanza from the Song of </p><p>13 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>Songs: “How beautiful are thy feet </p><p>with shoes, O Prince’s daughter!” </p><p>Truly, they were beautiful; slim, high- </p><p>arched, narrow-heeled, with long toes </p><p>straight and slender as the fingers of a </p><p>well-kept hand. </p><p>HPhe subdued rattle of limoge cups </p><p>a silver tray called his attention </p><p>^s the old servant entered with a pot </p><p>/hi steaming chocolate and a plate of </p><p>biscuit. </p><p> The girl faced him across the orange</p><p>points that flickered at the candle-tips, </p><p>chocolate pitcher poised above a cup. </p><p>“You are not Parisian, Citizen?” she </p><p>hazarded. “Your accent-” </p><p> “No, Mademoiselle-”</p><p> “We do not say 'Monsieur/ ‘Ma-</p><p>dame/ or ‘Mademoiselle’ now, Citi- </p><p>zen. The Convention has decreed that </p><p>we are citizens and citizenesses, no </p><p>more.” </p><p> “I am American, Mademoiselle ”</p><p>he answered, ignoring the rebuke. </p><p> “Ah? One understands, then. I</p><p>had thought perhaps you were a ci- </p><p>devant-■” She stopped abruptly, </p><p>as if frightened at the boldness of her </p><p>own words, and flashed a bright, hard </p><p>look at him. Then she smiled again, </p><p>and the hardness melted. “But no, one </p><p>need not fear; did not you rescue me </p><p>from them?” </p><p> He drew his brows down in a</p><p>thoughtful frown. “Them?” he won- </p><p>dered. “Who were they?” Twice to- </p><p>night he’d heard references to mysteri- </p><p>ous “them.” The old servant had </p><p>feared the girl had fallen into “their” </p><p>hands; he had rescued her from </p><p>“them,” it seemed. </p><p> “You mean the robbers who accosted</p><p> “They were no robbers, Monsieur ”</p><p>She dropped the masquerade of Revo- </p><p>lutionary nomenclature and spoke with </p><p>the polite formality of the old regime. </p><p>"They were agents of General Secur- </p><p>ity.” There was challenging defiance in </p><p>her tone, as if the simple statement im- </p><p>plied: “And aren’t you sorry that you </p><p>interfered, now? Don’t you want to run </p><p>away, before they come again and find </p><p>you with me?” </p><p> “Oh, so they were Robespierre’s bul-</p><p>lies? Well, t think one of them will </p><p>never trouble you or anyone again; too </p><p>bad I didn’t know, I could have finished </p><p>both of them-” </p><p> Thunderingly, the knocking at the</p><p>door broke through his words. “Open </p><p>—open in the name of the Republic!” </p><p>Her face drained white as if she had </p><p>been dead an hour. He saw her palsied </p><p>fingers crawling up her throat, clamp- </p><p>ing suddenly against her lips to stifle </p><p>back a cry. “They—they have traced </p><p>me-” </p><p> “Quiet, Mademoiselle!” Mordecai</p><p>was on his feet and blowing out the </p><p>candles. The heavy draperies at the </p><p>windows masked them from the out- </p><p>side, he was sure, but there must be no </p><p>glow behind him when he went to the </p><p>door. </p><p> Monsieur, you must not go; you</p><p>must flee, and quickly! They will take </p><p>you to the conciergerie, to the Tribunal, </p><p>the chopper-” </p><p> He laughed, low, harshly. “Remain</p><p>here, if you please, Mademoiselle. I </p><p>will outface them.” </p><p> Stamping angrily, he crossed the lit-</p><p>tle entrance hall. “Well?” he chal- </p><p>lenged as he flung the portal open. </p><p>“What is this annoyance, Citizens? </p><p>Cannot a man sleep quietly in his </p><p>house-” </p><p> The tattered little commissaire of</p><p>police and his ragged pikemen gaped as</p><p>Mordecai glared at them. This tall, </p><p>wide-shouldered man with the tan of </p><p>sun and sea on him, cold, dominant blue </p><p>SUSETTE </p><p>19 </p><p>eyes and uncompromising manner was </p><p>not what they expected. </p><p> “Your pardon, Citizen, but we are</p><p>looking for the Citizeness Susanne </p><p>Louvegny, ci-devant comtesse </p><p>d’Aules-” </p><p> “And you expect to find her here—</p><p>in my house? Imagine yourself that!” </p><p>He laughed, one short, impatient, chid- </p><p>ing note. “I am Mordecai Westhorne, </p><p>Paris representative of Westhorne et </p><p>Fils of Boston. You'seek for cocottes </p><p>here?” </p><p> The guardsmen drew aside a little.</p><p>“Un Americain—un has bleu—an </p><p>American blue-stocking!” one whis- </p><p>pered to the other. </p><p> “The Citizen has his passport?” The</p><p>commissaire was ill at ease. One did </p><p>not quite know how to take these sav- </p><p>ages from across the sea. Some of them </p><p>were worldly men—oui-da, fellows </p><p>most decidedly in the know—others </p><p>were chill and cold as Calvinists, and </p><p>all were very ready with the fist. Be- </p><p>sides, their ships were needed for com- </p><p>merce. . . . </p><p> Mordecai drew his laissez-passer</p><p>from his pocket and held it out in his </p><p>left hand, tapping his boot impatiently </p><p>with the blackthorn in his right. A </p><p>very little light flowed past him through </p><p>the door, the paper rattled in the wind, </p><p>making reading difficult. “Come, come, </p><p>man, don’t be all night about it! I have </p><p>been wet to the skin, and want to dry </p><p>myself before the fire-” </p><p> “Your pardon, Citizen,” t\\t commis-</p><p>saire returned the passport unread. </p><p>“Your papers seem in order. Naturally, </p><p>there is no such person as the ci-devant </p><p>comtesse here-” </p><p> “Naturally,” Mordecai agreed. His</p><p>mouth became a straight line, then </p><p>curved in a slight smile. “There is no</p><p>woman here but my old servant and </p><p>Madame”—deliberately he flung the </p><p>aristocratic title in their faces—“Ma- </p><p>dame Westhorne.” And thereupon he </p><p>slammed the door on the Republic’s </p><p>authority. </p><p>TTer face was very white, her lovely </p><p>eyes shadowed and tragic, when </p><p>he rejoined her. “They are gone, </p><p>Mademoiselle,” he told her soothingly. </p><p>But still she looked at him with fear- </p><p>filled, almost inattentive eyes, hardly </p><p>seeming to perceive the meaning of his </p><p>words. </p><p> Gently he repeated: “They are gone;</p><p>I sent them off.” </p><p> “Ah, but they will return, Monsieur!</p><p>They will never give up searching, es- </p><p>pecially with Hen riot to urge them </p><p> She paused a long breath-space;</p><p>then: “Do you truly think you killed </p><p>him?” </p><p> “Killed him? Whom do you mean?”</p><p>“Macrin Henriot, the man from </p><p>whom you rescued me; the one who </p><p>bore the sword.” </p><p> Mordecai laughed grimly. “I think</p><p>I.	did, and if I did not, he will surely</p><p>suffer from a headache for a long </p><p>time-” </p><p> “Ah, but if he is not dead I am un-</p><p>done, and so are you. He has followed </p><p>—hounded me, since I left Pont </p><p>l’Eveque. Fie was my father’s host- </p><p>ler-” </p><p> “Eh, a hostler-”</p><p> “But yes. We are Normans, we</p><p>Louvegnies; my father was the Comte </p><p>d’Aules, a poor but very honorable gen- </p><p>tleman. </p><p> “He farmed our estate, not dis-</p><p>daining to take part in manual labor </p><p>in the field himself, and believed as </p><p>firmly in the Social Contract of Rous- </p><p>seau as he believed in heaven. When</p><p>the States General were convoked he </p><p>came to Paris as a delegate, and as a </p><p>20 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>member of the National Assembly </p><p>helped draw the Constitution. </p><p> “One of the workers on our farm</p><p>was Macrin Henriot, a farrier and </p><p>stableman. He was about my age, and </p><p>as children we were playmates, for so- </p><p>cial distinctions were not tightly drawn </p><p>at Aules. He was handsome and high- </p><p>spirited, but given to long periods of </p><p>black melancholy. When these were on </p><p>him he would neither speak nor eat. </p><p>Once he tried to drown himself, and </p><p>would have done so if I had not </p><p>screamed until some laborers in the </p><p>field heard me and ran to pull him from </p><p>the river. May the good God pardon </p><p>me that scream! </p><p> “Macrin’s father was a farrier and</p><p>wanted him to learn the trade, but he </p><p>considered it beneath him; so when he </p><p>was fourteen and I twelve, and I was </p><p>sent for schooling to a convent, my </p><p>father in the goodness of his noble </p><p>heart sent Macrin to a notary at Caen </p><p>to study for the law, paying all of his </p><p>expenses. </p><p> “I was a pupil at the convent for</p><p>three years, and when I came back to </p><p>Aules I found Macrin in his father’s </p><p>place at our stables, doctoring and shoe- </p><p>ing horses. He had made a wretched </p><p>failure as a notary’s apprentice, and </p><p>had come back to the only work he </p><p>knew. </p><p> “No one else would hire him, no</p><p>one wanted him, for when he was not </p><p>sullen he was drunk, and when he was </p><p>not drunk he was inciting laborers and </p><p>peasants to revolt. </p><p> “I was sorry for my old playfellow,</p><p>and tried to comfort him, but he mis- </p><p>took my pity for a warmer, tenderer </p><p>feeling, and had the audacity to de- </p><p>mand my hand in marriage. </p><p> “Gentlewomen do not wed with stable-</p><p>boys, however long they may have </p><p>known them, and when my father tried </p><p>to make him understand, Macrin flew</p><p>into a rage and stormed out of the </p><p>chateau, vowing that we’d live to see </p><p>the day when I should beg him on my </p><p>knees to marry me, and he would spurn </p><p>me. </p><p> “You know the recent history of this</p><p>so unhappy country, Monsieur — how </p><p>the Jacobins assumed authority, how </p><p>they drove the patriot LaFayette to </p><p>exile, slew the king and decreed all for- </p><p>mer nobles, even moderate Republi- </p><p>cans, were traitors to the Revolution. </p><p> “Macrin Henriot had come to Paris</p><p>and become an agent of General Secur- </p><p>ity. It was he denounced my father to </p><p>the Tribunal, and sent him to the chop- </p><p>per without trial. I did not even know </p><p>that he had been arrested until I heard </p><p>the urchins bawl the names of those </p><p>who had ‘drawn prizes in the lottery of </p><p>Madame Guillotine.’ </p><p> “What was one to do, Monsieurf</p><p>To go home to Aules was to go to cer- </p><p>tain death, for in the North the peas- </p><p>ants had revolted, our chateau had </p><p>been burned to ashes; I should be rec- </p><p>ognized and denounced if I dared show </p><p>my face in the vicinity. Besides, how </p><p>could I make the journey? How could </p><p>I obtain a laissez-passer, traveling with- </p><p>out which meant sure death? I should </p><p>be safer if I stayed in Paris and kept </p><p>with in-doors than in any other part of </p><p>France. We had this little house in the </p><p>Street of the Windows, and to it I and </p><p>old Marjotte came for a refuge. She </p><p>does the marketing; I stay indoors all </p><p>day, and go out only in the evening </p><p>when the sun has set. Tonight I took </p><p>my customary promenade de sante and </p><p>had not walked a hundred feet when I </p><p>heard steps behind me. I walked more </p><p>slowly; so did they. At last I became </p><p>frightened and began to run, but before </p><p>I had gone twenty paces they were on </p><p>me, and when I turned to face them in </p><p>SUSETTE </p><p>21 </p><p>the rain I saw it was Macrin Henriot </p><p>and another. </p><p> “ ‘Bon soir, Mademoiselle la Com-</p><p>tesse/ he accosted me, taking off his hat </p><p>and bowing very low, as if he were a </p><p>gentleman; ‘it has been a long time </p><p>since we met, but met again we have. </p><p>Whom do you choose for husband now, </p><p>milady, the poor despised Macrin the </p><p>farrier!s son, or the chopper?’ </p><p> “I was so terrified I could not an-</p><p>swer, and my silence seemed to drive </p><p>him to a frenzy. </p><p> “‘What are we waiting for?’ he</p><p>asked his companion, and they un- </p><p>folded a horse-blanket and attempted </p><p>to envelop me in it. Then I screamed </p><p>for help, and—thanks to God and you, </p><p>I am still here.” </p><p>SPHERE was stark, abysmal terror in </p><p>“*■ her eyes and voice as she continued : </p><p>“But now I can no longer stay here. </p><p>They will hunt me out, run me to earth </p><p>as though I were a rabbit.

His companion probably re- </p><p>turned to General Security to report </p><p>that you had been seen in the neigh- </p><p>borhood, and the commissaire who </p><p>came here was engaged in routine can- </p><p>vass of the houses in this street. I as- </p><p>sured him that I lived here, and-” </p><p> He paused so long she prompted</p><p>him with a half-whispered, breathless: </p><p>“Yes, Monsieur?” </p><p> “Knowing Marjotte must have been</p><p>seen in the neighborhood and that per-</p><p>haps you had been observed when you </p><p>came out for your walks, I told the </p><p>commissaire there were two women </p><p>here, my aged servant and my wife.” </p><p>“But, Monsieur, your artifice will be </p><p>discovered-” </p><p> Mordecai’s New England conscience</p><p>troubled him a little as he broke in: “It </p><p>need not be, Mademoiselle. I can pack </p><p>a few belongings in pormanteaux and </p><p>move them here in a short time. My </p><p>lodgings are not far away, and I’ll re- </p><p>tain them for a time, but I can live </p><p>here, diereby giving the illusion that </p><p>this house is mine, Marjotte my ser- </p><p>vant, and you-” </p><p> He stopped, his sentence half com-</p><p>pleted, at the stricken look in her eyes. </p><p>She had not moved, nor had her ex- </p><p>pression altered, but, oddly, her soul </p><p>seemed retreating — racing in sheer </p><p>panic-footed terror—behind her cor- </p><p>neas. Before she had seemed merely </p><p>frightened. Now she was horrified. </p><p> “What-” he began, but halted</p><p>as she drew a deep, shuddering breath, </p><p>then expelled it in a'pitifully weary </p><p>sigh. </p><p> She was like a victim led to sacrifice,</p><p>and a mute appeal for pity mingled </p><p>with the tears that dewed her lashes </p><p>as she bent her head submissively and </p><p>whispered brokenly: “You have saved </p><p>my life, Monsieur. It is yours to do </p><p>with as you please. I accept your propo- </p><p>sition.” </p><p> “What?” His cheeks flushed red as</p><p>hers were pale. “You mean—you </p><p>thought that I would be so base-” </p><p> “WThat else was there to think, Mon-</p><p>sieur?” </p><p> “Wroman”—the sternness of his</p><p>Puritan forebears rose in his voice, </p><p>making his words hard and brittle—“I </p><p>am offering you protection; not asking </p><p>an exchange-” </p><p>22 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> “Ohe, Monsieur, you mean”—the</p><p>sudden light of relief flooding through </p><p>her face was like a sunrise breaking </p><p>through the piled-up black clouds of a </p><p>stormy night — “you mean that you </p><p>would live here in this house of mine </p><p>as if you were my frere de lait—my </p><p>foster-brother—like children playing </p><p>house ?” </p><p> “Precisely, Mademoiselle. ‘Like</p><p>children playing house’.” </p><p> “La, la!” It was incredible how</p><p>quickly her smile chased the look of </p><p>desolation from her face. “But that </p><p>will be the fun! </p><p> “Hurry, hasten, fly, Monsieur!</p><p>Make haste to bring your things to this </p><p>playhouse of ours. </p><p> “Marjotte,” she called up the stair-</p><p>way, “make ready the guest room all </p><p>quickly! Monsieur our rescuer will </p><p>come to live with us!” </p><p> She swept him a deep curtsy as he</p><p>paused upon the threshold. “Return </p><p>all soon, Monsieur—ohe, shame on me </p><p>for a thoughtless jade—I do not even </p><p>know your name!” </p><p> “Westhorne,” he answered. “Mor-</p><p>decai Westhorne.” </p><p> “Mardochee,” she pronounced, ren-</p><p>dering the English into French, then </p><p>with more difficulty, “Voestone?” </p><p>rnHE rain had stopped and the little </p><p>garden was brown and still under </p><p>its canopy of unshed October leaves as </p><p>Mordecai set out for his lodgings. As </p><p>he stepped into the Street of the Win- </p><p>dows his heart rose. Aunt Deborah </p><p>surely would have understood and ap- </p><p>proved what he was doing. What was </p><p>the little French girl’s name—-Susanne? </p><p>Susanne—Susette. He liked the name </p><p>Susette, liked it better each time he re- </p><p>peated it, and he repeated it more </p><p>times than one. Susette—Susette, its </p><p>cadence kept time with the scuffing of </p><p>the rain-soaked leaves beneath his heels </p><p>as he walked. </p><p> 2.	“Like Children Playing House”</p><p>rpi-iEY dined in the small salle a man- </p><p> ger beside the latticed window. Two</p><p>candles lighted them; old Marjotte </p><p>served them, silent-footed, austere, </p><p>handling dish and salver with a dignity </p><p>that made the simple meal a rite: con- </p><p>somme—trust a woman peasant-bred </p><p>to get the last fine bit of nourishment </p><p>from a four-inch length of beef shin- </p><p>bone !—smelts fried a crisp gold-brown </p><p>in olive oil, steamed escargots in sauce </p><p>Bercy—Mordecai was doubtful of the </p><p>snails, but became enthusiastic with a </p><p>convert’s ardor after the first taste—a </p><p>chicory salad, finally cheese and toasted </p><p>biscuit with black, bitter coffee. The </p><p>wine, a white vin ordinaire, was tart </p><p>almost to acidness, but Susette would </p><p>not be depressed. “This year’s vintage </p><p>is a bitter one for France,” she told </p><p>him as they clinked glasses, “but there </p><p>will be other years and other vintages. </p><p>Danton is gone, Marat is killed—the </p><p>good God rest the martyred Charlotte </p><p>Corday’s soul — Robespierre cannot </p><p>last for ever. The sun must shine again, </p><p>surely!” </p><p> Mordecai had lived in the small villa</p><p>for a month, and life with Susette— </p><p>“like children playing house”—had </p><p>been most pleasant. She was a gay, </p><p>mercurial little creature, oddly mature </p><p>sometimes, more often childishly art- </p><p>less. For a few days it had been “bon </p><p>jour, Monsieurwhen he left for the </p><p>office, and “enchantee de vous revoir” </p><p>when he came back at night. But that </p><p>was only for a few days. Now it was </p><p>a gay “a bientot” when he left, and an </p><p>even gayer “bienvenu!” at his return. </p><p>Before they had been housemates for a </p><p>week she turned her face up to be </p><p>SUSETTE </p><p>23 </p><p>kissed when he came home, naturallv </p><p>and unaffectedly as an affectionate </p><p>child. Now the rite was performed </p><p>three times daily: when he left for his </p><p>bureau, when he returned at night, just </p><p>before she bade him “bonne nuit ” and </p><p>he saw the flicker of her little feet upon </p><p>the stairs as she went up to bed. </p><p> Tonight she was in high spirits, for</p><p>it was their “anniversary”; she had </p><p>been "Madame Voestone” a whole </p><p>month. In honor of the occasion she </p><p>had put on ‘‘her best—her very finest,” </p><p>and the result was ravishing. </p><p> Her bright fair hair was waved up</p><p>from the neck and temples with curls </p><p>massed high on top and filleted with </p><p>violet ribbon in the Grecian mode </p><p>which had swept Paris and all France </p><p>with the revival of classicism. In her </p><p>little ears were hung two beautifully </p><p>matched cameos outlined in gold and </p><p>seed-pearls and almost large as Span- </p><p>ish “pillar dollars.” A necklace of an- </p><p>tique matte gold hung round her throat </p><p>and its pendant was a duplicate of her </p><p>ear-ornaments. A bracelet of gold set </p><p>with a fourth matched cameo was </p><p>clasped about her left arm just above </p><p>the elbow. Her gown of sheer white </p><p>muslin would have been revelatory as a </p><p>wisp of veiling if it had not been gath- </p><p>ered in close knife-pleats running ver- </p><p>tically from bosom to hem. It was cut </p><p>with a round neck-line, low in front and </p><p>back, with tiny puff-sleeves at the shoul- </p><p>ders, fitted tightly at the bust, but flar- </p><p>ing sharply from the high-set waist </p><p>which was defined by a long, sweeping </p><p>sash of violet ribbon tied at the back in </p><p>a coquettish bow whose ends draped </p><p>nearly to the floor. Her sandals were </p><p>gilt leather, heelless as a ballet dancer’s </p><p>shoes, and laced with violet ribbons, </p><p>and through the meshes of their silken </p><p>lattice her white feet gleamed seduc- </p><p>tively. </p><p> The firelight played about them as</p><p>they sat upon the sofa after dinner. </p><p>Streaming out across the hearth it red- </p><p>dened walls and floor; shadows ad- </p><p>vanced and retreated as the ever-rest-</p><p>Iess flames rose, wavered, and then </p><p>flickered down again. Like sportive </p><p>wavelets of a serene sea the glowing </p><p>tide advanced across the blue tiles of </p><p>the hearth, highlighting the satin house- </p><p>pumps Mordecai was wearing, flashing </p><p>on the golden soles and violet ribbons </p><p>of Susette’s little sandals. </p><p> “It has been pretty, this month, has</p><p>it not, my Mardochee?” she asked in a </p><p>small, almost voiceless whisper as she </p><p>tucked one foot up under her and </p><p>swung the other to and fro as if to </p><p>tease the flickering firelight with the </p><p>little white and gold and violet thing. </p><p>Instinctively as a bird finds its nest her </p><p>small hand stole into his big one. “It </p><p>has been a garden filled with fragrant </p><p>flowers; the memory of it will'perfume </p><p>all life hereafter. But yes, my Mar- </p><p>dochee, although the blood-drinkers </p><p>are raging through the land and the </p><p>chopper takes the heads of all the good </p><p>and brave and just who still remain, it </p><p>is not hard to trust the future. There </p><p>is no doubt of God's great goodness </p><p>when I think of this time we have had </p><p>together-” She broke off with a lit- </p><p>tle sigh, half of contentment, half of </p><p>melancholy. </p><p> “Why do you sigh, Susette?”</p><p> “I did but think.”</p><p> “Of what?”</p><p> “Of how sweet it must be to be truly</p><p>wed to one like thee, my Mardochee.” </p><p>Mordecai’s breath came so fast that </p><p>it nearly stifled him. A quick throbbing, </p><p>half pain, half ecstasy, seemed beating </p><p>with insistent hammer-rhythm in his </p><p>breast. </p><p> “Susette,” he whispered, and the</p><p>effort it cost him to speak was almost </p><p>24 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>more than he could bear, “you love me, </p><p>Susette ?” </p><p> She turned her face to him, lips</p><p>moist and dewy with the yearnings of </p><p>youth, a rich, ripe look of promise in </p><p>her eyes. “More than I can tell, mon </p><p>adore!” </p><p> Warm and tender, her slim arms</p><p>were tight about his neck, he could feel </p><p>the tears from her eyes on his cheek, </p><p>her voice was full of gentleness and </p><p>love as she repeated murmuringly: </p><p>“Mon adore, mon amoureux, mon </p><p>precieux! 0, Mardochee, je faime, je </p><p> He drew her to him, kissed her</p><p>slowly, bending her head back against </p><p>the sofa-arm, pillowing her neck in his </p><p>bent arm. She whimpered softly, al- </p><p>most as in pain, became limp and yield- </p><p>ing, then tightened her arms round his </p><p>neck again, drawing him down to the </p><p>lusciousness of satin-smooth red lips. </p><p> Afterwhiles they sat upon the sofa,</p><p>hand in hand and waist in arm, and </p><p>gazed into the alternately leaping and </p><p>curtsying flames as if they could fore- </p><p>read the future in their flickering </p><p>brightness. “We must be married very </p><p>soon, my dear,” said Mordecai. " To- </p><p>morrow, if possible. I will go to the </p><p>mairie on my way to the bureau-” </p><p>“Mon Dieu!” The hand Susette had </p><p>raised to rearrange her misty, glowing </p><p>hair was checked at her forehead. “We </p><p>cannot—dare not marry, Mardochee !” </p><p>“Why not, my love? It will be </p><p>simple-” </p><p> “Non, non! Consider, if you please.</p><p>I am Susanne Louvegny, ci-devant com- </p><p>tcsse d’Aules. My father was beheaded </p><p>on the guillotine, I myself am hors la </p><p>lot—outside the law. To be recognized </p><p>is to be arrested, to be arrested is to be </p><p>condemned to death. They give us ci- </p><p>devant s no trial at the Tribunal, only </p><p>sentence to the chopper. You see, </p><p>m’ami, it is not possible. There is no </p><p>birth certificate or baptismal record for </p><p>me that you can give them, you dare </p><p>not even tell them who I am!” </p><p> “But when we’re married you will</p><p>be a citizen of the United States. They </p><p>Mall not dare-” </p><p> “But certainly—when we are mar-</p><p>ried ! Until that time I am a citizeness </p><p>of France, and subject to her laws, </p><p>however savage they may be. Think </p><p>you they would let you snatch me from </p><p>them, cheat the chopper-” </p><p> “By Jupiter!” The impact of his</p><p>hand against his knee broke off her </p><p>half-hysterical recital. </p><p> “What is it that you have, mon</p><p>cherf” </p><p> “Our ship the Deborah, commanded</p><p>by my brother Hezekiah, will be at Le </p><p>Havre within the week. I'll send a </p><p>message to him, asking him to bring </p><p>her up the Seine. We can go in a closed </p><p>coach to the piers, and once you are </p><p>aboard her we’ll defy the whole garde </p><p>nationale to take you off again. When </p><p>we are out of cannon-shot of land my </p><p>brother as the master of the ship will </p><p>marry us. You shall go home with me, </p><p>petite Susette, home to America, and be </p><p>‘Madame Voestone’ in fact as well as </p><p>reputation!” </p><p> Then for a long space they sat look-</p><p>ing in the fire and held each other </p><p>tightly. Words were superfluous. Two </p><p>have no need of words when they are </p><p>deeply, tremulously, wonderingly in </p><p>love. </p><p>3.	Macrin Henriot Again</p><p>All day the city quailed before a </p><p>storm which threatened but for- </p><p>bore to strike. There were occasional </p><p>grumblings of thunder, now and then a </p><p>livid cicatrix of lightning scarred the </p><p>sky, but the air hung heavy, breathless- </p><p>still, as if in mute expectancy; the dry </p><p>SUSETTE </p><p>25 </p><p>dead leaves were quiet on the trees, a </p><p>menacing twilight, brassy-yellow and </p><p>unreal, filled the streets. But Susette </p><p>was indifferent to the threat of rain and </p><p>tempest, her brain and heart were too </p><p>filled with anticipation to give heed to </p><p>such-like unimportant things. Returning </p><p>from the notion shop where she had </p><p>made a few purchases—soap, a flacon </p><p>of perfume, a spool of silk and a small </p><p>box of rice-powder—she walked with a </p><p>sort of lilting, questing eagerness. The </p><p>Deborah had come up the Seine that </p><p>afternoon: tonight she and Marjotte </p><p>and Mordecai would board her; tomor- </p><p>row7 morning with the turning of the </p><p>tide they'd set sail for America and </p><p>love and freedom- No more to be a </p><p>fugitive, hunted like a brute beast; no </p><p>more to live in constant dread with the </p><p>weight of never-ceasing fear upon her </p><p>nerves and terror gnawing at her heart! </p><p>One could not but be very happy in </p><p>such circumstances. Le bon Dieu was </p><p>very good indeed, life was very good, </p><p>Mardochee, especially, was good. Un- </p><p>bidden and spontaneously a snatch </p><p>from Mozart's Marriage of Figaro </p><p>welled up to her lips: </p><p> What is this feeling makes me so sad?</p><p> What is this feeling makes me so glad?</p><p> Pain that delights me—how can it be?</p><p> Pleasure that pains me,</p><p> Fetter’d though free . . .</p><p> The song died in a little gasp, and up</p><p>her back a tiny chill of apprehension </p><p>rippled. There was no breeze—the </p><p>leaves upon the street-side trees hung </p><p>motionless as if they had been painted </p><p>on the scenery of a theatre—but some- </p><p>where in the street behind her, or in the </p><p>alley which let into it, there was a dry, </p><p>harsh, crackling rustle. Not a footstep, </p><p>but a scuffing, as of stealthy feet among </p><p>the fallen leaves that strewed the </p><p>gutters. </p><p> She quickened her pace almost to a</p><p>run; the rustle ceased, and she relaxed </p><p>her haste. She was nervous, like a silly </p><p>child that starts at nothing. Too long </p><p>living in the shadow of the chopper, too </p><p>much longing for tomorrow—“Thou </p><p>little foolish one !” she chid herself. “It </p><p>was a sparrow scratching in the leaves </p><p>in hope of food, perhaps a dog or cat.” </p><p>But reason abdicates when terror </p><p>comes. However sensible her explana- </p><p>tion was, it did not satisfy her. Once </p><p>more she quickened pace; her little san- </p><p>daled feet w:ere fairly twinkling as she </p><p>turned into the Street of the Windows. </p><p>Yonder was her home, there lay sanc- </p><p>tuary. . . . </p><p> The live coals of the smoldering sun-</p><p>set died beneath the ashes of the twi- </p><p>light, and suddenly the street was filled </p><p>with shadows. And something more! </p><p>Ahead of her, obscure in the unlighted </p><p>highway, a vague, half-visible, half </p><p>guessed-at umbrose something flitted </p><p>from one tree trunk to another, and </p><p>this time she heard unmistakably the </p><p>scuffing of a boot-heel on the bricks. </p><p>TTTHAT was that behind her ? At first </p><p> *	' it was so faint she could not tell if</p><p>she heard or imagined it; now it ap- </p><p>proached, and she knew it was no fig- </p><p>ment of disordered fancy. Step—shuffle </p><p>—-step, she heard it limping nearer </p><p>wTith a dreadful, dragging hobble, a </p><p>sort of terrifying dot-and-carry-one, as </p><p>though some obscene wounded thing </p><p>were slithering toward her. Terror, </p><p>stark, unreasoning, chilling terror, took </p><p>her by the throat, and she broke into a </p><p>run, the awkward, knock-kneed run of </p><p>a woman, unmindful of what lay before </p><p>her if only she could leave this sham- </p><p>bling, dragging, stealthy pursuer be- </p><p>hind. </p><p> “Your pardon, Citiziness, we would</p><p>have a word with you!” from the dark- </p><p>ness of the angle of a wall a form </p><p>i </p><p>26 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>emerged, and with it came another, and </p><p>another. The street seemed filled to </p><p>overflowing with vague shapes, shapes </p><p>almost without outline or faces, only </p><p>eyes. </p><p> She could not know — her terror</p><p>would not let her realize—that they </p><p>were men enveloped in long cloaks and </p><p>muffled to the eyes. They seemed a </p><p>cloud of horror-shapes more dreadful </p><p>than the loup-garou of Norman forests </p><p>with which her nurse had frightened </p><p>her so long ago at Aules. </p><p> Fright mounted to sheer panic, and</p><p>panic gave way to a paralyzing horror </p><p>as the limping, dragging step came </p><p>nearer, scuffed and shuffled to a halt, </p><p>and paused beside her. </p><p> “Ha, you have her? A merveille!”</p><p>The voice was low and harsh and rau- </p><p>cous as the tearing of a sheet of paper, </p><p>but she recognized it. Macrin Henriot! </p><p> And now the blind was snapped from</p><p>a dark-lantern, and the beam shone in </p><p>her face, dazzling her with its quick </p><p>brightness—but not in time. Before </p><p>her dazed eyes ceased to function she </p><p>beheld him peering at her through the </p><p>gloom, leering like a fiend that comes </p><p>to snatch a forfeit soul to hell. </p><p> Macrin Henriot, playmate of her</p><p>childhood, discredited notary’s appren- </p><p>tice, farrier in her father’s stables, </p><p>agent of the police of the Terror—but </p><p>how changed! His dark, handsome, </p><p>morose face was twisted almost out of </p><p>semblance to a human countenance; one </p><p>eye was closed until it was the merest </p><p>slit; a corner of the mouth sagged down </p><p>until it set his lips in a perpetual </p><p>twisted, sneering grin, exposing teeth </p><p>and drooling spittle; the whole side of </p><p>his face seemed to have slipped, as </p><p>though it had been dough that sloughed </p><p>to shapelessness with its own weight. It </p><p>overflowed the line of his jawbone, </p><p>hanging down with a hound’s dewlap. </p><p>And as the face was, so the body was </p><p>deformed. One shoulder thrust gro-</p><p>tesquely up, as if his spine were perma- </p><p>nently twisted in a corkscrew bend; the </p><p>arm was bent at an unnatural angle and </p><p>the hand was rigid, splay-boned, as urn </p><p>like a human hand as if it were the </p><p>gnarled root of a dead tree. One leg </p><p>was stiffened at the knee as if bound </p><p>fast in splints; the foot was twisted at </p><p>the ankle till it turned in almost at a </p><p>right angle. </p><p> This was the reason for the halting,</p><p>dragging, shuffling limp, the dreadful </p><p>dot-and-carry-one with which he </p><p>walked. Paralysis! She had seen a </p><p>peasant on her father’s farm deformed </p><p>in such a way when a horse had kicked </p><p>him on the head. The blow from Mor- </p><p>decai’s lead-loaded bludgeon . . . </p><p> He was speaking, slowly, painfully,</p><p>with a sort of slobbering lisp. His eyes </p><p>were dilated and bright with hate, his </p><p>twisted mouth fell open and clapped </p><p>shut as if he had no mastery of it, his </p><p>deformed hand was fumbling like a fish </p><p>that dies upon the angler’s string, he </p><p>slobbered like a mad dog with each </p><p>word he uttered. But she could under- </p><p>stand him. All too well! </p><p> “B on soir, Mademoiselle la Com-</p><p>tesse. I have long anticipated this meet’ </p><p>ing. This time it is the chopper, with </p><p>no choice between it and the poor </p><p>cripple, Macrin Henriot. It was a </p><p>merry chase you led us with your mas- </p><p>querade of being Madame Voestone, </p><p>but at last we have you in the net, my </p><p>pretty little pigeon. This time we shall </p><p>not suffer interruption by Monsieur </p><p>VAmericain. I have seen to that!” </p><p> A great lump, hot as molten lead,</p><p>was forming in Susette’s throat; there </p><p>was a ringing in her ears that shut out </p><p>every other sound. Her heart seemed </p><p>smashed to fragments and each sepa- </p><p>rate, aching piece was being torn out by </p><p>SUSETTE </p><p>27 </p><p>the roots. She was taken on the eve </p><p>of her escape; Mardochee was taken, </p><p>too—had he not said, ‘PAmericain, I </p><p>have seen to that’?—her world was </p><p>broken into little bits and the bits were </p><p>ground to powder in the cruel mills of </p><p>the Gods of Desolation. There was a </p><p>frantic feeling in her breast beside her </p><p>heart, she was choking, stifling, dying. </p><p> “Pardl’, she swoons!” she heard a</p><p>man exclaim as a wave of blackness </p><p>flooded over her. </p><p> “Ehi bien, then bring her out of it.</p><p>Thrust a pin in her!” </p><p> There was a fumbling in the crowd,</p><p>the rustling of clothing as a pin was </p><p>sought, then a bitter, piercing pain in </p><p>her left leg as the pointed wire was </p><p>inserted to the head. She tried to </p><p>writhe away, to cry out, to plead for </p><p>pity from the torture, but she could </p><p>neither move nor speak nor make the </p><p>smallest sound. </p><p> “Tiens, mon commissaire, I think</p><p>that she has died of a heart failure,” </p><p>the man who stabbed her with the pin </p><p>told Henriot. “She does not respond </p><p>to my tickling." </p><p> Rough hands were on her wrists, she</p><p>felt her eyelids drawn back and knew </p><p>a light flashed in her pupils, even </p><p>though she saw no light. Then another </p><p>hand thrust underneath her fichu, her </p><p>outraged virgin bosom felt the pres- </p><p>sure of cold fingers just above her </p><p>heart. The hand was withdrawn slowly, </p><p>as if loath to leave her tender flesh, </p><p>and: “B’en oui, elle est morte. A coup </p><p>sur!” </p><p> “Bring the candle. Give it here!”</p><p> She heard the lantern rattle as the</p><p>candle was removed from it, felt her </p><p>sandal torn without unlacing from her </p><p>left foot, then, excruciatingly, a sear- </p><p>ing, branding pain against her first and </p><p>second toes. </p><p> Again she tried to scream, to draw</p><p>away from the intolerable torment; </p><p>once more she found herself unable so </p><p>much as to flutter an eyelid or bend toe </p><p>or finger. </p><p> uVraiment, elle est morte .” It was</p><p>Henriot speaking, and his voice was </p><p>softer than it had been. She felt his </p><p>breath against her cheek as he knelt </p><p>down beside her, heard him murmur, </p><p>“Ohe, my little Suzon, I am sorry! I </p><p>would have sent you to the chopper, but </p><p>only because I loved you. You were so </p><p>beautiful, so lovely—and so far above </p><p>me. If I could not have you, I could </p><p>not bear that any other should-” A </p><p>sob, deep retching, almost strangling, </p><p>broke his whisper, and if she could have </p><p>moved she would have winced beneath </p><p>the impact of his twisted, flaccid lips as </p><p>he pressed a kiss against her mouth. </p><p>“Adieu, petite compagne,” he breathed, </p><p>“adieu pour Veternite!” </p><p> “Eh bien, it seems the chopper has</p><p>been cheated,” remarked a policeman. </p><p>“The trench is still open at the cime- </p><p>tiere de la Madeleine; only ten were </p><p>chopped today. Shall we-” </p><p> “Non!” Henriot denied. “I will not</p><p>have her buried in the common fosse. </p><p>Let a three-year concession be </p><p>opened-” </p><p> “The citizen commissaire forgets</p><p>that graves cost money, even three-year </p><p>graves,” a guardsman cut in dryly. </p><p>“Who will pay for the concession?” </p><p>“Here,” Henriot thrust a crumpled </p><p>wad of assignats into the fellow’s hand, </p><p>“see thou to it! Some of you stand </p><p>guard by her; you others, come with </p><p>me. I have some more arrests to make, </p><p>but I will have a wagon sent for her.” </p><p> 4.	“Love Is Strong as Death . .</p><p>MORDECAI was packing in his lodg- </p><p>ings. Most of his things had been </p><p>transferred to Susette’s little house, but </p><p>28 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>some odds and ends remained in the </p><p>apartment, and he was not minded to </p><p>leave them behind. </p><p> A happiness so great it almost hurt</p><p>suffused him like the afterglow of a </p><p>drink of fine old sherry. Susette— </p><p>Susette, his heart seemed beating to the </p><p>rhythm of her name. This was almost </p><p>too good to be true, it was like some- </p><p>thing dreamed or read in a romance, </p><p>too wonderful, too sweet, too utterly </p><p>heart-satisfying to have happened to </p><p>anyone like him. A singing heart needs </p><p>singing lips to complement it, and in- </p><p>stinctively he raised his lusty baritone </p><p>in Master Isaac Watts’ Farina: </p><p> “There is a land of pure delight</p><p> Where saints immortal reign;</p><p> Eternal day excludes the night,</p><p> And pleasures banish pain.</p><p> There everlasting spring abides,</p><p> And never-fading flowers;</p><p> Death, like a narrow sea, divides</p><p> This heav’nly land from-”</p><p> “M’sieur, M’sieur Mardochee”—</p><p>high, cracked, hysterical, old Mar- </p><p>jotte’s voice broke his rendition of the </p><p>hymn—“pour Vamour de Dieu, come; </p><p>oh, come at once!” </p><p> She was clawing at him blindly. Her</p><p>gnarled old hands were so deformed </p><p>with age and labor and rheumatism </p><p>that they looked like malformed, dying </p><p>branches on a dwarfed pine tree; her </p><p>eyes were glazed and filmed with grief </p><p>and terror; little Becks of bubble-froth </p><p>hung in the corners of her convulsed </p><p>mouth. </p><p> “Come, come, M’sieur,” she gab-</p><p>bled, “it is la petite—the little Su- </p><p>sette-” Her thin, shrill, brittle voice </p><p>cracked like a shattering glass and she </p><p>dropped down to the settle, hugging </p><p>both hands to her stomach, rocking to</p><p>and fro in an excess of agony too acute </p><p>for words. </p><p> “Good heavens, what is it, Mar-</p><p>jotte?” Mordecai took her shoulders in </p><p>his hands and shook her gently. “What </p><p>has happened--” </p><p> “Ohe, M’sieur, they’ve taken her,</p><p>and she is dead!” </p><p> “What? You mean Susette’s ar-</p><p>rested-” </p><p> “She is dead, M’sieur. Oui-da, I my-</p><p>self have seen her corpse!” </p><p> Mordecai dropped on the bed, eyes</p><p>staring, mouth a little open. “Dead?” </p><p>he echoed unbelievingly. </p><p> uVraiment. But yes, M’sieur. I saw</p><p>her lying there all cold with the guards- </p><p>men round her-" </p><p> “When—how did it happen?"</p><p> “She-went to the shop of Mere Du-</p><p>val to make some litde purchases be- </p><p>fore the sun went down. I begged her </p><p>not to go out in the twilight unattended, </p><p>but she laughed at me. Had we not </p><p>been safe from molestation since you </p><p>took us under your protection? But </p><p>certainly. I was preparing dinner, and </p><p>when lamp-lighting time had come and </p><p>she had not returned, I had concern. </p><p>It was a dinner fit for our farewell to </p><p>France, M’sieur—oysters, sole, cane- </p><p>ton au jour-” </p><p> “Yes, yes; of course. I’m sure the</p><p>dinner was a work of art, Marjotte, </p><p>but what of Mademoiselle Susette?” </p><p> “B’en, M’sieur. When she came not</p><p>I had the anxiety, and went to seek for </p><p>her. Less than a hundred meters from </p><p>the house I came upon her lying in the </p><p>street with a ring of guardsmen round </p><p>her. I am aid, but when I wish to be I </p><p>am of the silent foot, M’sieur. I crept </p><p>up to them as noiselessly as any mouse. </p><p>There lay my little one, my lamb, my </p><p>baby, dead upon her back, and they</p><p>were standing by and looking at her. </p><p>There was Macrin Henriot — may </p><p>Satan snatch him to hell with his eyes </p><p>wide open!—and with him were his </p><p>so vile myrmidons. Me, I heard them </p><p>SUSETTE </p><p>29 </p><p>talking. Oh, yes! She had suffered a </p><p>heart failure when they set upon her, </p><p>it seemed, and one of them suggested </p><p>that they pitch her in the common grave </p><p>where those who have been chopped lie </p><p>in la Madeleine. But Henriot de- </p><p>manded that she be put in a three-year </p><p>concession—she who is a noble dame </p><p>to lie in a vile pauper’s grave! Better </p><p>to be buried in the fosse with all the </p><p>good ones done to death by Robe- </p><p>spierre than lie in such a sepulcher—” </p><p>“You’re sure that she was dead, not </p><p>fainting?” </p><p> (cMais oui, M’sieur. Too sure; too</p><p>sure ! I saw them feel her pulses, flash </p><p>a light into her eye, and as the crown- </p><p>ing infamy burn her little so sweet foot </p><p>with fire to see if it would blister. </p><p>Helas, my little one, my tiny duckling, </p><p>my sweet pigeon, thou art dead!” </p><p> Her wail became wild, high, keen,</p><p>rose to a frenzied shriek, then failed </p><p>with very intensity. She fought for </p><p>breath, mouthed toothless gums as if </p><p>she sought to bite the agony that racked </p><p>her, rolled her eyes up till the pupils </p><p>disappeared beneath the lids; then, </p><p>“Buried alive! She screamed in agony of scul and body. </p><p>30 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>with a choking, retching cry, half gasp, </p><p>half hiccup, fell forward on her face, </p><p>twitched spasmodically, and lay still. </p><p> It needed no physician to pronounce</p><p>her dead. The film-glazed eyes, the </p><p>flaccid jaw, the prolapsed tongue and </p><p>idiotically opened mouth all bore their </p><p>eloquent testimony. Marjotte lay dead </p><p>of a broken heart, and Mordecai’s </p><p>heart was breaking. </p><p>TTow long he sat there staring sight- </p><p>lessly at nothing he could never </p><p>tell. He was stunned, but not too </p><p>stunned to suffer. The world seemed </p><p>desolate as it had been before God’s </p><p>spirit moved upon the waters and de- </p><p>creed, “Let there be light.” </p><p> Light? 1’ God's good name, what</p><p>talk was this of light? There was no </p><p>light! The sun and moon and stars had </p><p>gone forever from his firmament; only </p><p>shadows, cold and everlasting, stayed. </p><p>He tried to face the facts, but one </p><p>dreadful sentence rang with clamoring </p><p>echoes in his brain, beating out all other </p><p>thought. Susette, little sweet Susette, </p><p>was dead. Dead, and already lying in </p><p>a pauper’s grave in the cemetery of the </p><p>Madeleine. Nevermore would he be </p><p>greeted by her purling, laughing voice, </p><p>never feel the touch of her soft hands </p><p>again, never look into her face. . . . </p><p> “By heaven, I will J” he shouted, and</p><p>rose to fling his cloak about him and </p><p>stamp out into the street. “Adieu, my </p><p>poor Marjotte. I am going to her.” </p><p> He'd promised her. “You shall go</p><p>home with me, petite Susette de mon </p><p>coeur” he’d said, and go with him she </p><p>should. </p><p> She was buried in a three-year grave,</p><p>virtually laid on the surface; he could </p><p>tear the earth away, break the flimsy </p><p>coffin with his hands and take her little </p><p>body to the Deborah. Brother Heze- </p><p>kiah would provide a pipe of rum into </p><p>which they could put her; her flesh </p><p>should not know corruption until they</p><p>had reached Boston and he'd laid her </p><p>in the Westhorne family plot within </p><p>the shadow of Kings’ Chapel. </p><p>rpHE wind was rising now, and the </p><p>“■-'storm that had delayed all day was </p><p>breaking. “Howl tempest; bellow, </p><p>thunder; pour, rain!” It had been rain- </p><p>ing on the night he met her; it was fit- </p><p>ting it should rain tonight. </p><p> “Susette—Susette !" As on the night</p><p>he met her, so now the scuffing of his </p><p>feet upon the leaves kept cadence with </p><p>the syllables of her name. Tears </p><p>streamed down his face as in his mind’s </p><p>eye he beheld her at the table with the </p><p>gleam of candlelight upon her arms and </p><p>shoulders, sensed the perfume of her </p><p>nearness as they sat upon the sofa by </p><p>the fire. When he closed his hand he </p><p>almost felt the answering pressure of </p><p>her litde fingers. </p><p> Her little hands, her laughing eyes,</p><p>her sweet, small, ivory-gleaming feet! </p><p>They’d minded him of Solomon’s </p><p>canticle when he first saw them; now </p><p>another stanza of the Song of Songs </p><p>ran in his mind. He smiled sardonically </p><p>as he recalled the citations—sixth verse, </p><p>eighth chapter of the Song of Songs: </p><p>“Love is strong as death!” </p><p> He repeated it, again—again. Its</p><p>meter seemed to fall into the rhythm </p><p>of a drum that beats time for a march </p><p>—“Love—is—strong-as-death; Love </p><p>—is—strong-as-death!” </p><p> Now he'd reached the Place de la</p><p>Revolution. Grim and bare as Death’s </p><p>own hungry skeleton the chopper </p><p>reared in ghastly silhouette against a </p><p>flare of lightning. That way, to the </p><p>right, the cemetery of the Madeleine </p><p>lay. Rain came down in gusts, in tor- </p><p>rents, floods.

Inferno</p><p>TTThen Susette fell she tried to sum- </p><p>mon strength to scream. With </p><p>almost superhuman effort she sought to </p><p>cry out, at least to groan, to twitch a toe </p><p>or bend a finger—to do anything to </p><p>make them realize she was still alive. </p><p>The thought of being strapped down </p><p>to the chopper’s plank, to have to look </p><p>into the blood-stained basket waiting </p><p>for her head, had been a constant night- </p><p>mare, but the chopper would be prefer- </p><p>able to this. To be nailed in a coffin, </p><p>carted to the cemetery, buried while </p><p>alive—to smother slowly, horribly . . . </p><p> “Misere de Dieushe heard a</p><p>guardsman swear, ‘“will he never come, </p><p>that one? Me. I am no croque-mort— </p><p>no damned watcher of the dead-” </p><p> The clop-clop of a horse’s hooves</p><p>against the flints sounded. “Hola, mes </p><p>enfants, you have a fare for old Jac- </p><p>ques-Corbillard, yes?” a voice hailed </p><p>through the gloom. “Bon. Help me </p><p>with this sacre coffin. The devil take </p><p>those carpenters, they make them heav- </p><p>ier each day!” </p><p> The rough pine box thumped hol-</p><p>lowly upon the pavement; she felt her- </p><p>self heaved into it, heard the grate of </p><p>wood on wood as the cover was laid on, </p><p>heard the bang of hammer against nail </p><p>and felt the jarring impact as they fas- </p><p>tened down the lid. They shoved the </p><p>coffin in the cart. A whip cracked. . . . </p><p> Often she had wondered how the</p><p>wretches in the tumbril felt as they </p><p>were hurried to the guillotine. Now she </p><p>knew if they could have compared her </p><p>fate with theirs they would have sung </p><p>for joy. Theirs was a mercifully swift </p><p>end: a stroke, a shock, and all was </p><p>done. She was being taken to a slow </p><p>and awful death by suffocation in the </p><p>grave. </p><p> The minutes had seemed endless as</p><p>she lay bereft of sight and movement </p><p>on the pavement. Now it seemed the </p><p>shambling cart-horse had the wings of </p><p>Pegasus as it ambled slowly toward the </p><p>cemetery. </p><p> They had halted. She felt the shock</p><p>as they dragged her from the cart and </p><p>dropped her on the muddy earth. Her </p><p>feet were higher than her head as the </p><p>driver and a helper manhandled the </p><p>coffin. Another jarring thump and she </p><p>had come to rest; then a report deafen- </p><p>ing as the bursting of a bombshell </p><p>sounded just above her heart and the </p><p>confined air inside the coffin beat against </p><p>her ear-drums with the shock of it. A </p><p>second detonation on the lid above her </p><p>face, a third, a fourth, a perfect ava- </p><p>lanche of shocks as clod on roaring clod </p><p>came rattling down by shovelfuls upon </p><p>the coffin top. </p><p> Her ears were paralyzed by the con-</p><p>tinuous battering of the falling earth; </p><p>she could feel the constantly-increasing </p><p>weight of it upon her breast, her mouth, </p><p>her nostrils. She made a last supreme </p><p>effort to rouse and scream for help; </p><p>then a great flare, bright as blazing </p><p>lightning, burst against her eyes, and </p><p>the last shred of sensation left her. </p><p>Qlowly consciousness returned. How </p><p>^ good it wTas to lie here in her bed, </p><p>to know the terrible experience had </p><p>been a nightmare! She had not been </p><p>seized by Henriot, not taken up for </p><p>dead, not dropped unceremoniously in </p><p>a grave. Presently, when she had had </p><p>a chance to soothe her shaken nerves, </p><p>she’d call Marjotte and have her make </p><p>a cup of chocolate; then she’d rest un- </p><p>til the morning came. </p><p> But how dark it was! The curtains</p><p>had been drawn to keep the deadly </p><p>32 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>night air out, of course, but this was </p><p>pitch-black darkness, impenetrable as a </p><p>velvet hood. She moved her arms un- </p><p>easily. To left and right were hard, </p><p>rough wooden walls that pressed her </p><p>sides and interfered with movement. </p><p>She started up and fell back with a </p><p>startled cry, for she had struck her </p><p>head a violent blow. The air about her </p><p>pressed against her ears; it had a damp </p><p>and heavy feeling, as though confined. </p><p> Then with a reason-shattering shock</p><p>she knew. Her scalp began to sting </p><p>and prickle as the awful truth ran </p><p>through her like an icy wave. This was </p><p>no dream, but dreadful fact. The bonds </p><p>of lethargy had dropped away, she was </p><p>once more mistress of her body, con- </p><p>scious, able to call out for help—but </p><p>none would ever hear her. She was cof- </p><p>fined, shut up beneath a mound of </p><p>muddy earth in the cemetery of the </p><p>Madeleine. </p><p> Buried alive!</p><p> She screamed in agony of soul and</p><p>body. The horrible reverberation of </p><p>her voice in the sealed coffin rang </p><p>against her ears like thunder-claps </p><p>tossed back by mountain-peaks. </p><p> Her eyes were open—open staring-</p><p>wide—and she searched the Stygian </p><p>darkness for a gleam of light. It was </p><p>as if she pressed her fingers on her </p><p>closed eyelids. Only fiery sparks and </p><p>shining patches of bright lightning- </p><p>color showed, changed and faded like </p><p>the patterns of a kaleidoscope. </p><p> Then she went mad. Shrieking, curs-</p><p>ing the day that she was born and the </p><p>God that let this dreadful fate befall </p><p>her, she writhed and twisted, kicked and </p><p>struggled. The coffin sides pressed her </p><p>so closely that she could not get her </p><p>hands up to her head, else she would </p><p>have torn her hair out by the roots </p><p>and scratched her face to the bone; but </p><p>she dug her nails into her thighs </p><p>through the flimsy stuff of her gown </p><p>and bit her lips and tongue until her</p><p>mouth was choked with blood and her </p><p>raving cries were muted like the gurgles </p><p>of a drowning man. At last with a tre- </p><p>mendous effort she turned herself face </p><p>down and beat her brow against the </p><p>coffin floor. Again and again she struck </p><p>her forehead on the rough pine planks, </p><p>getting a slight surcease from her hor- </p><p>ror in the pain. </p><p> Once more she writhed inside the</p><p>straitness of her tomb, twisted till she </p><p>lay upon her back, arched her body, </p><p>drew her knees up, kicked frenziedly </p><p>against the coffin foot. It gave a very </p><p>little and she thought she saw a flicker- </p><p>ing glow of light. One little minute, </p><p>just long enough to breathe the air </p><p>while they rushed her to the chopper— </p><p>let her smell the open air once more! </p><p>She started up, her forehead crashed </p><p>against the coffin lid. A wave of weak- </p><p>ness flooded over her. She fell back, </p><p>sick and faint. . . . </p><p>6.	“It Is a Vampire!”</p><p>HIhe rain had slacked almost imper- </p><p>ceptibly as Mordecai strode toward </p><p>the cemetery. By the time he reached </p><p>the sexton’s hut beside the gate there </p><p>was no water falling save wind-lashed </p><p>drippings from the trees and eaves. </p><p> His first knock brought no answer,</p><p>but continued hammering at last evoked </p><p>a shuffling step, and a blast of super- </p><p>heated, almost fetid air swept from the </p><p>little house as the door was opened on </p><p>a six-inch crack. Behind the little </p><p>gnome-like man who peered at him </p><p>through the small opening Mordecai </p><p>descried a candle burning in a bottle </p><p>and a charcoal poele glowing redly. </p><p> “The Citizen has doubtless lost his</p><p>way,” the porter venftired. “This is </p><p>the Cemetery of the Madeleine.” </p><p>SUSETTE </p><p>33 </p><p> “The Citizen is not lost, and he is</p><p>perfectly aware this is the Cemetery of </p><p>the Madeleine,” Mordecai replied; </p><p>then, not waiting for the invitation </p><p>which he knew would not be tendered, </p><p>he pushed the little man aside and </p><p>stepped into the pentice. </p><p> “The Citizen sexton would doubtless</p><p>like to make some extra money?” he </p><p>asked. “Say five hundred or a thousand </p><p>francs?” </p><p> “Un Americain” the porter recog-</p><p>nized his slight accent, “and mad, as </p><p>all the Yankees are.

The chopper has been </p><p>very busy—:—” </p><p> “This one was not chopped. She was</p><p>found dead upon the street and hur- </p><p>ried here for burial. In a three-year </p><p>grave——” </p><p> “B’en out. One remembers now. I</p><p>helped the cartman bury her-” </p><p> “I wrant her disinterred.”</p><p> “Parbleu, you are a resurrectionist</p><p>—an anatomist, perhaps?” </p><p> Mordecai drew out his purse and</p><p>dropped a golden louis on the pile of </p><p>paper money. “You will do it?” </p><p> The sexton eyed the money greed-</p><p>ily. “For fifteen hundred francs, per- </p><p>haps-” </p><p> “A thousand or nothing.”</p><p> “Mille tonnerres, Citizen, you have</p><p>no heart! A poor man scarcely has the </p><p>wherewithal to live these days, and the </p><p>risk I run is great. However”—as </p><p>Mordecai prepared to thrust the notes </p><p>and gold back in his pocket—“one con- </p><p>sents. There is nothing else to do. If </p><p>the citizen must have the body at his </p><p>price, then he must have it at his price.” </p><p>He shrugged as only Frenchmen can </p><p>shrug when they wish to indicate com- </p><p>plete dissociation from a matter, </p><p>shuffled to the comer and picked up a </p><p>rusty spade and pick-ax. “I wait your </p><p>pleasure, Citizen.”</p><p>^ SORT of eery half-light lay upon the </p><p>graveyard as they picked their </p><p>way down what had been a graveled </p><p>path. Across the clay-stained almost </p><p>turfless lawn the fosse 01* common </p><p>trench for executed bodies cut like a </p><p>saber-slash in dirty flesh. Those whose </p><p>names should be embalmed in history </p><p>lay in the muddy ditch: Louis XVI, </p><p>Charlotte Corday, Louis d’Orleans, </p><p>Marie Antoinette. Silhouetted stark </p><p>and ghastly by the torn clouds were </p><p>the age-stained marble tombs of the </p><p>wealthy, mostly empty now, for the </p><p>mob had ransacked them for valuables </p><p>and thrown their tenants out upon the </p><p>bone-pile. A little farther off the rough </p><p>unsodded mounds of ten-year graves </p><p>were ranged beneath their wooden </p><p>markers, none of which was cross- </p><p>shaped, for religious emblems were </p><p>forbidden for the dead as for the liv- </p><p>ing. Huddled by the wall there showed </p><p>the graves of the poor dead, five- and </p><p>three-year concessions. </p><p> Graves of the five-year class were</p><p>scarcely deeper than the coffins they en- </p><p>closed, but their occupants could lie in </p><p>them for half a decade. The three- </p><p>year graves were little more than </p><p>mounds of sodden earth heaped over </p><p>coffins laid in two-foot trenches. In </p><p>thirty-six months they would be leveled </p><p>and the bodies in them thrown into the </p><p>cemetery’s common charnel-house. It </p><p>was toward one of these the sexton </p><p>strode. </p><p> “Grand Dieul” he cried as the light</p><p>from his dark-lantern picked the mound </p><p>of mud from the surrounding darkness. </p><p>“Observe him, Citizen!” </p><p> Face downward on the grave, arms</p><p>spread as if he would embrace it, lay </p><p>a man, and from the cockade in his hat </p><p>and the tri-colored sash around his </p><p>waist they recognized him as an agent </p><p>of Public Security. No need to ask if </p><p>he were dead or how he died. The </p><p>wound in his right temple, spilling </p><p>blood that dyed the red clay deeper </p><p>SUSETTE </p><p>35 </p><p>red, and the pistol grasped in his hand </p><p>with cadaveric rigor told the story. </p><p> “Morbleu, un suicide!” the inten-</p><p>dant murmured. “Eh bien, he chose a </p><p>good place for it.” </p><p> Unconcernedly as it he moved a bale</p><p>of merchandise he prized the dead man </p><p>from the grave-mound with his spade. </p><p>The candle-iantem shed its gleam into </p><p>the face of Macrin Henriot. </p><p> “Ccst ca, that is that. Shall we begin,</p><p>Citizen ? Hold the lamp, if you please.” </p><p>The sexton struck his spade into the </p><p>grave, tossed back the clinging clay, </p><p>and dug again. In a few minutes he </p><p>had laid the coffin bare and with the </p><p>flat end of his pick began to wrench the </p><p>lid away. </p><p> Mordecai leaned forward, lantern</p><p>raised. In the coffin lay Susette, rigid </p><p>as if petrified. Her hands were tightly </p><p>clenched, nails driven into palms, with </p><p>little streams of drying blood running </p><p>from each self-inflicted wound. Her </p><p>eyes were closed, but on her slightly- </p><p>parted lips there lay a double line of. </p><p>bloody froth. </p><p> “Sainte Vierge” — terror drove</p><p>long-cultivated atheism from the in- </p><p>tendant — ’‘Blessed Man,-, pit}' us! </p><p>Come, Citizen, and quickly. It is a vam- </p><p>pire lying there! Behold the life-like </p><p>countenance, the opened lips a” bloody </p><p>from the devil’s breakfast, the hands </p><p>all stained with gore!” </p><p> His teeth were chattering, but he</p><p>was no coward. “Stand back, Citizen, </p><p>and let me deal with it. I will strike it </p><p>to the foul heart with my pickax, sever </p><p>its unhallowed head with my spade, and </p><p>we shall fill the grave again-” </p><p> “Non, non!” cried Mordecai as the</p><p>sexton raised his pick to carry out his </p><p>threat. Bending over the coffin he whis- </p><p>pered, “Susette, little sweet Susette, did </p><p>they do this to thee-” An impulse</p><p>he could not explain moved him to lay </p><p>his hand against her cheek. Her flesh </p><p>was warm. </p><p> He thrust the sexton back so vio-</p><p>lently he landed sitting in a pool of </p><p>muddy water, where he squatted like an </p><p>elderly and nervous duck, squawking </p><p>pleas for Mordecai to “come away all </p><p>quickly.” </p><p> But Mordecai did not come. Sinking</p><p>to his knees beside the grave he laid </p><p>his hand on Susette’s heart. There was </p><p>no doubt of it. Faint as the fluttering </p><p>of a fledgling dropped from its nest and </p><p>almost perished with exposure, but still </p><p>perceptible, a feeble pulse was beating. </p><p> ‘'Here"—he tossed a fistful of assi-</p><p>gnats at the sexton—“close the grave, </p><p>and keep the mouth closed, also, mon </p><p>vieux.” </p><p> Next moment he had bundled Susette</p><p>in his cloak and started for the grave- </p><p>yard wall. </p><p> 7.	“Until the Morning Comes . .</p><p>PTIhe alleyway behind the cemetery </p><p>was lined with mews upon its far- </p><p>ther side and almost dark as a tun- </p><p>nel. The sky, cloud-shrouded, pressed </p><p>down on roofs and chimneys, but where </p><p>the alley joined a cross-street a feeble </p><p>patch of luminance coned down from </p><p>an oil lantern fixed against a house </p><p>wall. Slogging through the mud and </p><p>filth that smeared the cobbles, Morde- </p><p>cai saw a cat dart from the shelter of </p><p>the cemetery wall, pause in mid-step, </p><p>one foot upraised, then shrink into in- </p><p>visibility against the miry roadway. It </p><p>had seen something he could not, and </p><p>with never-failing feline instinct dis- </p><p>trusted it. Now from somewhere in the </p><p>street beyond the turning came a foot- </p><p>fall, then another. Flowing through the </p><p>gloom that waited just outside the circle </p><p>of the lantern’s infirm beams he saw </p><p>shadows darker than the shadows that </p><p>36 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>were there before. Iri an instant light </p><p>gleamed on bayonets and pike-heads </p><p>and a sword. It was the patroutlie grhe </p><p>—the night patrol upon their rounds. </p><p>The alley was a cul-de-sac, the blank- </p><p>faced stables were all barred and </p><p>double-locked, behind him was the </p><p>eight-foot cemetery wall, and anyone </p><p>who ran or sought to hide was instantly </p><p>suspect. </p><p> He drew a deep breath, swung Su-</p><p>sette down to his side, supporting her </p><p>with one arm around her waist beneath </p><p>the cloak, and, staggering, half in simu- </p><p>lation, half with the awkwardness of </p><p>his burden, began to sing: </p><p>"La vie est breve,—hie </p><p>Un peu d’espcir, </p><p>Un peu de revet—hie </p><p>Et puis—bon soir!” </p><p> The hiccup terminating the ditty</p><p>was a masterpiece of inebriety, and the </p><p>brigadier commanding the patrol </p><p>laughed sympathetically. He too en- </p><p>joyed an evening in the wine shops. To </p><p>guzzle good red wine and feel the </p><p>amorous touch of little hands—par- </p><p>bleu, that was the man's life, not walk- </p><p>ing through the stinking alleys search- </p><p>ing for aristocrats! “He, Citizen,” he </p><p>called, “you would best go home and </p><p>sleep it off, that debauche. Mon Dieu, </p><p>but you are drunk like a pig—lucky </p><p>one!” </p><p>rpHE streets were gray and empty, like </p><p>the veins of a corpse from which </p><p>the blood has been drained slowly; a </p><p>hard dull-pewter luminance, not light </p><p>nor yet darkness, permeated the air, </p><p>and the wind was damp and chilling as </p><p>the breath from a forced-open tomb </p><p>as Mordecai turned toward the river. </p><p> Here were the w'harves, redolent</p><p>with bilge and brackish water and the </p><p>strange scents of cargoes from far </p><p>away. Ships’ masts and yard-arms </p><p>barred the eastern sky like barriers at </p><p>prison windows. The deserted quays </p><p>echoed small sounds like an empty audi-</p><p>torium: the scuttering of rats’ feet, </p><p>the grind of oaken sides on piles, the </p><p>groan of cables in hawse-holes. </p><p> Susette stirred and whimpered, like a</p><p>child affrighted by a dream. He bent </p><p>his head and kissed her lightly. “Safe, </p><p>my darling—safe! Rest thou in my </p><p>arms until the morning comes and shad- </p><p>ows flee away. . . .” </p><p> The sky was gray as a soiled silver</p><p>bowl, but morning-light was polishing it </p><p>to brightness. Dawn was at the city </p><p>gates, and Paris slept. </p><p> A ship’s lamp glinted on the blade</p><p>of a cutlas; the thump of sea-boots </p><p>sounded on the flagstones as a sentry </p><p>paced before the gangway of a clipper </p><p>tied up at the quay. Though he was </p><p>far away, the hymn-tune that he sang </p><p>to while away his vigil sounded with </p><p>an unmistakable New England accent: </p><p> “One day of prayer and praise</p><p> His sacred courts within,</p><p> Is sweeter than ten thousand days</p><p> Of pleasurable sin.”</p><p> “What ship is this?” Panting, stag-</p><p>gering, all but spent, Mordecai ap- </p><p>proached the singing sailor, his precious </p><p>burden clasped tight in his arms. </p><p> “She’s th’ Deborah out o’ Boston</p><p>town — howdy, Master Mordecai! </p><p>Come aboard, we’re waitin’ fer ye,” </p><p>answered the seaman; then, with a bel- </p><p>low up the gangway: </p><p> “Hey, Cap’n Westhorne; they’ve ar-</p><p>rove!” </p><p>By C.

So </p><p>this was Hellsgarde. She had seen it </p><p>many times in her mind’s eye as she saw </p><p>it now from the high hill in the yellow </p><p>light of sunset that turned every pool </p><p>of the marshes to shining glass. The </p><p>long causeway to the castle stretched </p><p>out narrowly between swamps and </p><p>3 7 </p><p>"While the wild challenge still echoed </p><p>on her lips, a ravenous mouth came </p><p>storming down to silence hers. </p><p>38 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>reeds up to the gate of that grim and </p><p>eery fortress set alone among the quick- </p><p>sands. This same castle in the marshes, </p><p>seen at evening from the high hilltop, </p><p>had haunted her dreams for many </p><p>nights now. </p><p> “You'll find it by sunset only, my</p><p>.lady,” Guy of Garlot had told her with </p><p>a sidelong grin marring his comely dark </p><p>face. “Mists and wilderness ring it </p><p>round, and there’s magic in the swamps </p><p>about Hellsgarde. Magic—and worse, </p><p>if legends speak truth. You’ll never </p><p>come upon it save at evening.” </p><p> Sitting her horse now on the hilltop,</p><p>she remembered the grin in his black </p><p>eyes and cursed him in a whisper. </p><p>There w*as such a silence over the whole </p><p>evening world that by instinct she dared </p><p>not speak aloud. Dared not? It was </p><p>no normal silence. Bird-song did not </p><p>break it, and no leaves rustled. She </p><p>huddled her shoulders together a little </p><p>under the tunic of link-mail she wore </p><p>and prodded her horse forward down </p><p>the hill. </p><p> Guy of Garlot—Guy of Garlot! The</p><p>hoofbeats thumped out the refrain all </p><p>the wTay downhill. Black Guy wTith his </p><p>thinly smiling lips and his slanted dark </p><p>eyes and his unnatural comeliness—un- </p><p>natural because Guy, within, was ugly </p><p>as sin itself. It seemed no design of </p><p>the good God that such sinfulness </p><p>should wear Guy’s dark beauty for a </p><p>fleshly garment. </p><p> The horse hesitated at the head of</p><p>the causeway which stretched between </p><p>the marsh pools toward Hellsgarde. </p><p>Jirel shook the reins impatiently and </p><p>smiled a one-sided smile downward at </p><p>his twitching ears. </p><p> “I go as loathly as you,” she told</p><p>him. “I go wincing under spurs too, </p><p>my pretty. But go I must, and you </p><p>too.” And she cursed Guy again in a </p><p>lingering whisper as the slow hoofbeats </p><p>reverberated upon the stone arches of </p><p>the causeway.</p><p> Beyond it loomed Hellsgarde, tall</p><p>and dark against the sunset. All around </p><p>her lay the yellow light of evening, </p><p>above her in the sky, below her in the </p><p>marshy pools beneath which quicksands </p><p>quivered. She wondered who last had </p><p>ridden this deserted causeway in the </p><p>yellow glow of sunset, under what </p><p>dreadful compulsion. </p><p> For no one sought Hellsgarde for</p><p>pleasure. It was Guy of Garlot’s slant- </p><p>ing grin that drove Jirel across the </p><p>marshes this evening—Guy and the </p><p>knowledge that a score of her best men- </p><p>at-arms lay shivering tonight in his </p><p>dripping dungeons with no hope of life </p><p>save the hope that she might buy their </p><p>safety. And no riches could tempt </p><p>Black Guy, not even Jirel’s smoothly </p><p>curving beauty and the promise of her </p><p>full-lipped smile. And Garlot Castle, </p><p>high on its rocky mountain peak, was </p><p>impregnable against even Jirel’s mas- </p><p>terfully planned attacks. Only one </p><p>thing could tempt the dark lord of Gar- </p><p>lot, and that a thing without a name. </p><p> “It lies in Hellsgarde, my lady,” he</p><p>had told her with that hateful smooth </p><p>civility which his sleek grin so belied. </p><p>“And it is indeed Flell-guarded. An- </p><p>dred of Hellsgarde died defending it </p><p>two hundred years ago, and I have </p><p>coveted it all my life. But I love liv- </p><p>ing, my lady! I would not venture into </p><p>Hellsgarde for all the wealth in Chris- </p><p>tendom. If you want your men back </p><p>alive, bring me the treasure that An- </p><p>dred died to save.” </p><p> “But what is it, coward?”</p><p> Guy had shrugged. “Who knows?</p><p>Whence it came and what it was no </p><p>man can say now. You know the tale as </p><p>well as I, my lady. He carried it in a </p><p>leather casket locked with an iron key. </p><p>It must have been small — but very </p><p>HELLSGARDE </p><p>39 </p><p>precious. Precious enough to die for, </p><p>in the end—as I do not propose to die, </p><p>my lady! You fetch it to me and buy </p><p>twenty lives in the bargain.” </p><p> She had sworn at him for a coward,</p><p>but in the end she had gone. For after </p><p>all, she was Joiry. Her men were hers </p><p>to bully and threaten and command, </p><p>but they were hers to die for too, if </p><p>need be. She was afraid, but she re- </p><p>membered her men in Garlot’s dun- </p><p>geons with the rack and the boot await- </p><p>ing them, and she rode on. </p><p>^Hhe causeway was so long. Sunset </p><p> had begun to tarnish a little in the</p><p>bright pools of the marsh, and she </p><p>could look up at the casde now without </p><p>being blinded by the dazzle beyond. A </p><p>mist had begun to rise in level layers </p><p>from the water, and the smell of it was </p><p>not good in her nostrils. </p><p> Hellsgarde—Hellsgarde and An-</p><p>dred. She did not want to remember </p><p>the hideous old story, but she could not </p><p>keep her mind off it this evening. An- </p><p>dred had been a big, violent man. pas- </p><p>sionate and wilful and very cruel. Men </p><p>hated him, but when the tale of his </p><p>dying spread abroad even his enemies </p><p>pitied Andred of Hellsgarde. </p><p> For the rumor of his treasure had</p><p>drawn at last besiegers whom he could </p><p>not overcome. Hellsgarde gate had </p><p>fallen and the robber nobles who cap- </p><p>tured the castle searched in vain for </p><p>the precious casket which Andred </p><p>guarded. Torture could not loosen his </p><p>lips, though they tried very terribly to </p><p>make him speak. He was a powerful </p><p>man, stubborn and brave. He lived a </p><p>long while under torment, but he would </p><p>not betray the hiding-place of his treas- </p><p>ure. </p><p> They tore him limb from limb</p><p>at last and cast his dismembered body </p><p>into the quicksands, and came away </p><p>empty-handed. No one ever found </p><p>Andred’s treasure.</p><p> Since then for two hundred years</p><p>Hellsgarde had lain empty. It was a </p><p>dismal place, full of mists and fevers </p><p>from the marsh, and Andred did not </p><p>lie easy in the quicksands where his </p><p>murderers had cast him. Dismembered </p><p>and scattered broadcast over the </p><p>marshes, yet he would not lie quiet. Fie </p><p>had treasured his mysterious wealth </p><p>with a love stronger than death itself, </p><p>and legend said he walked Hellsgarde </p><p>as jealously in death as in life. </p><p> In the two hundred years searchers</p><p>had gone fearfully to ransack the </p><p>empty halls of Hellsgarde for that </p><p>casket—gone, and vanished. There </p><p>was magic in the marshes, and a man </p><p>could come upon the castle only by sun- </p><p>set, and after sunset Andred’s violent </p><p>ghost rose out of the quicksands to </p><p>guard the thing he died for. For gen- </p><p>erations now no one had been so fool- </p><p>hardy as to venture upon the way Jirel </p><p>rode tonight. </p><p> She was drawing near the gateway.</p><p>There was a broad platform before it, </p><p>just beyond the place where Andred’s </p><p>drawbridge had once barred the ap- </p><p>proach to Hellsgarde. Long ago the </p><p>gap in the causeway had been filled in </p><p>with rubble by searchers who would </p><p>reach the castle on horseback, and Jirel </p><p>had thought of passing the night upon </p><p>that platform under the gate arch, so </p><p>that dawn might find her ready to begin </p><p>her search. </p><p> But—the mists between her and the</p><p>castle had thickened, and her eyes </p><p>might be playing her false—but were </p><p>not those the shapes of men drawn up </p><p>in a double row before the doorway of </p><p>Flellsgarde? Hellsgarde, that had </p><p>stood empty and haunted these two </p><p>hundred years? Blinking through the </p><p>dazzle of sun on water and the thick- </p><p>40 </p><p>'WEIRD TALES </p><p>ening of the mists, she rode on toward </p><p>the gateway. She could feel the horse </p><p>trembling between her knees, and with </p><p>every step he grew more and more re- </p><p>luctant to go on. She set her teeth and </p><p>forced him ahead resolutely, swallow- </p><p>ing her own terror. </p><p> They were the figures of men, two</p><p>rows of them, waiting motionless be- </p><p>fore the gate. But even through the </p><p>mist and the sun-dazzle she could see </p><p>that something was wrong. They were </p><p>so still—so unearthly still as they faced </p><p>her. And the horse was shying and </p><p>trembling until she could scarcely force </p><p>him forward. </p><p> She was quite near before she saw</p><p>what was wrong, though she knew that </p><p>at every forward step the obscure </p><p>frightfulness about these guardsmen </p><p>grew greater. But she was almost upon </p><p>them before she realized why. They </p><p>were all dead. </p><p> The captain at their front stood</p><p>slumped down upon the great spear </p><p>that propped him on his feet, driven </p><p>through his throat so that the point </p><p>stood out above his neck as he sagged </p><p>there, his head dragging forward un- </p><p>til his cheek lay against the shaft which </p><p>transfixed him. </p><p> And so stood all the rest, behind him</p><p>in a double row, reeling drunkenly upon </p><p>the spears driven through throat or </p><p>chest or shoulder to prop them on their </p><p>feet in the hideous semblance of life. </p><p> So the company of dead men kept</p><p>guard before the gateway of Hells- </p><p>garde. It was not unfitting—dead men </p><p>guarding a dead castle in the barren </p><p>deadlands of the swamp. </p><p> jirel sat her horse before them for a</p><p>long moment in silence, feeling the </p><p>sweat gather on her forehead, clench- </p><p>ing her hands on the pommel of the </p><p>saddle. So far as she knew, no other </p><p>living person in decades had ridden the </p><p>long causeway to Hellsgarde; certainly '</p><p>no living man had dwelt in these </p><p>haunted towers in generations. Yet— </p><p>here stood the dead men reeling against </p><p>the spears which had slain them but </p><p>would not let them fall. Why ?—how ? </p><p>—when? . . . </p><p> Death was no new thing to Jirel.</p><p>She had slain too many men herself to </p><p>fear it. But the ghastly unexpected- </p><p>ness of this dead guard! It was one </p><p>thing to steel oneself to enter an empty </p><p>ruin, quite another 'to face a double </p><p>row of standing dead men whose blood </p><p>still ran in dark rivulets, wetly across </p><p>the stones at their feet. Still wet— </p><p>they had died today, then. Today </p><p>while she struggled cursing through the </p><p>wilderness something had slain them </p><p>here, something had made a jest of </p><p>death as it propped them on their dead </p><p>feet with their dead faces toward the </p><p>causeway along which she must come </p><p>riding. Had that something expected </p><p>her? Could the dead Andred have </p><p>known-? </p><p> She caught herself with a little shud-</p><p>der and shrugged beneath the mail, </p><p>clenching her fingers on the pommel, </p><p>swallowing hard. (Remember your </p><p>men—remember Guy of Garlot—re- </p><p>member that you are Joiry!) The </p><p>memory of Guy’s comely face, bright </p><p>with mockery, put steel into her and </p><p>she snapped her chin up with a mur- </p><p>mured oath. These men were dead— </p><p>they could not hinder her. . . . </p><p>WAS that motion among the ghastly </p><p>guard? Her heart leaped to her </p><p>throat and she gripped the saddle be- </p><p>tween nervous knees •with a reflex ac- </p><p>tion that made the horse shudder. For </p><p>one of the men in the row before her </p><p>was slipping silently toward the flag- </p><p>stones. Had the spear-butt slid on the </p><p>bloody tiles? Had a breeze dislodged </p><p>HELLSGARDE </p><p>41 </p><p>his precarious balance? There was no </p><p>breeze. But with a curious little sigh </p><p>from collapsing lungs he folded gently </p><p>downward to his knees, to his side, to </p><p>a flattened proneness on the stones. </p><p>And a dark stream of blood trickled </p><p>from his mouth to snake across the </p><p>pavement as he lay there. </p><p> Jirel sat frozen. It was a night-</p><p>mare. Only in nightmares could such </p><p>things happen. This unbearable silence </p><p>in the dying sunset, no breeze, no mo- </p><p>tion, no sound. Not even a ripple upon </p><p>the mirroring waters lying so widely </p><p>around her below the causeway, light </p><p>draining from their surfaces. Sky and </p><p>water were paling as if all life receded </p><p>from about her, leaving only Jirel on </p><p>her trembling horse facing the dead </p><p>men and the dead castle. She scarcely </p><p>dared move lest the thump of her </p><p>mount’s feet on the stones dislodge the </p><p>balance of another man. And she </p><p>thought she could not bear to see mo- </p><p>tion again among those motionless </p><p>ranks. She could not bear it. and yet— </p><p>and yet if something did not break the </p><p>spell soon the screams gathering in her </p><p>throat would burst past her lips and </p><p>she knew she would never stop scream- </p><p>ing. </p><p> A harsh scraping sounded beyond</p><p>the dead guardsmen. Her heart </p><p>squeezed itself to a stop. And then </p><p>the blood began to thunder through </p><p>her veins and her heart leaped and fell </p><p>and leaped again in a frenzied pound- </p><p>ing against the mail of her tunic. </p><p> For beyond the men the great door</p><p>of Hellsgarde was swinging open. She </p><p>gripped her knees against the saddle </p><p>until her thighs ached, and her knuckles </p><p>were bone-white upon the oommel. She </p><p>made no move toward the great sword </p><p>at her side. What use is a sword </p><p>against dead men? </p><p> But it wras 110 dead man who looked</p><p>out under the arch of the doorway, </p><p>stooped beneath his purple tunic with </p><p>the heartening glow of firelight from</p><p>beyond reddening his bowed shoulders. </p><p>There was something odd about his </p><p>pale, pinched face upturned to hers </p><p>across the double line of dead defen- </p><p>ders between them. After a moment </p><p>she recognized wrhat it was—he had the </p><p>face of a hunchback, but there was no </p><p>deformity upon his shoulders. He </p><p>stooped a little as if with weariness, </p><p>but he carried no hump. Yet it was </p><p>the face of a cripple if she had ever </p><p>seen one. Flis back was straight, but </p><p>could his soul be? Would the good </p><p>God have put the sign of deformity </p><p>upon a human creature w'ithout cause? </p><p>But he was human—he was real. Jirel </p><p>sighed from the bottom of her lungs. </p><p> “Good evening to you, my lady,”</p><p>said the hunchback (but he was not </p><p>humped) in the flat, ingratiating voice </p><p>of a cripple. </p><p> “These—did not find it good,” said</p><p>Jirel shortly, gesturing. And the man </p><p>grinned. </p><p> “My master’s jest,” he said.</p><p> Jirel looked back to the rows of</p><p>standing dead, her heart quieting a </p><p>little. Yes, a man might find a grim </p><p>sort of humor in setting such a guard </p><p>before his door. If a living man had </p><p>done it, for an understandable reason, </p><p>then the terror of the unknown was </p><p>gone. But the man- </p><p> “Your master?” she echoed.</p><p> “My lord Alaric of ITellsgarde—</p><p>you did not know?” </p><p> “Know what?” demanded Jirel</p><p>flatly. She was beginning to dislike </p><p>the fellow’s sidelong unctuousness. </p><p> “Why, that my lord’s family has</p><p>taken residence here after many genera- </p><p>tions away.” </p><p> “Sir Alaric is of Andred’s kin?”</p><p> “He is.”</p><p>42 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> Jirel shrugged mentally. It was</p><p>God’s blessing to feel the weight of </p><p>terror lift from her, but this would </p><p>complicate matters. She had not known </p><p>that Andred left descendants, though </p><p>it might well be so. And if they lived </p><p>here, then be sure they would already </p><p>have ransacked the castle from keep to </p><p>dungeon for that nameless treasure </p><p>which Andred had died to save and had </p><p>not yet forsaken, were rumor true. </p><p>Had they found it? There was only </p><p>one way to learn that. </p><p> “I am nighted in the marshes,” she</p><p>said as courteously as she could man- </p><p>age. “Will your master give me shel- </p><p>ter until morning?” </p><p> The hunchback’s eyes—(but he was</p><p>no hunchback, she must stop thinking </p><p>of him so !)—his eyes slid very quickly, </p><p>yet very comprehensively, from her </p><p>tanned and red-lipped face downward </p><p>over the lifting curves of her under the </p><p>molding chain-mail, over her bare </p><p>brown knees and slim, steel-greaved </p><p>legs. There was a deeper unctuousness </p><p>in his voice as he said: </p><p> “My master will make you very wel-</p><p>come, lady. Ride in.” </p><p>Jirel kicked her horse’s flank and </p><p>guided him, snorting and trembling, </p><p>through the gap in the ranks of dead </p><p>men which the falling soldier had left. </p><p>He was a battle-charger, he was used to </p><p>dead men; yet he shuddered as he </p><p>minced through these lines. </p><p> The courtyard within was warm with</p><p>the light of the great fire in its center. </p><p>Around it a cluster of loutish men in </p><p>leather jerkins looked up as she passed. </p><p> “Wat, Piers—up, men!” snapped</p><p>the man with the hunchback’s face. </p><p>“Take my lady’s horse.” </p><p> jirel hesitated a moment before she</p><p>swung from the saddle, her eyes dubi- </p><p>ous upon the faces around her. She </p><p>thought she had never seen such brutish</p><p>men before, and she wondered at the </p><p>lord who dared employ them. Her own </p><p>followers were tough enough, reckless, </p><p>hard fellows without fear or scruple. </p><p>But at least they were men. These louts </p><p>around the fire seemed scarcely more </p><p>than beasts; let greed or anger stir </p><p>them and no man alive could control </p><p>their wildness. She wondered with </p><p>what threats of punishment the lord </p><p>Alaric held sway here, what sort of </p><p>man he must be to draw his guard from </p><p>the very dregs of humanity. </p><p> The two who took her horse stared</p><p>at her under shaggy beetle-brows. She </p><p>flashed them a poison glance as she </p><p>turned to follow the purple cloak of </p><p>her guide. Her eyes were busy. Hells- </p><p>garde had been a strong fortress in </p><p>Andred’s day; under Alaric it was well </p><p>manned, but she thought she sensed a </p><p>queer, hovering sullenness in the very </p><p>air as she followed her guide across the </p><p>courtyard, down a passageway, under </p><p>an arch into the great hall. </p><p> The shadows of two hundred</p><p>haunted years hovered under the lofty </p><p>roof-beams. It was cold here, damp </p><p>with the breath of the swamps outside, </p><p>dark with two centuries of ugly legend </p><p>and the terrible tradition of murder. </p><p>But Alaric before the fire in his scarlet </p><p>tunic seemed pleasantly at home. The </p><p>great blaze roaring up the chimney </p><p>from six-foot logs drove back the chill </p><p>and the dark and the damp a little in a </p><p>semicircle about the fireplace, and in </p><p>that semicircle a little company of </p><p>brightly clad people sat silent, watching </p><p>Jirel and her guide cross the echoing </p><p>flags of the great hall toward them. </p><p> It was a pleasant scene, warm and</p><p>firelit and bright with color, but even </p><p>at a distance, something was wrong— </p><p>something in the posture of the people </p><p>crouching before the blaze, something </p><p>HELLSGARDE </p><p>43 </p><p>in their faces. Jirel knew a moment </p><p>of wild wonder if all this were real. </p><p>Did she really walk a haunted ruin </p><p>empty two hundred years? Were the </p><p>people flesh and blood, or only the </p><p>bright shadows of her own imagina- </p><p>tion that had so desperately longed for </p><p>companionship in the haunted marsh? </p><p> But no, there was nothing illusive</p><p>about Alaric in his high-backed chair, </p><p>his face a pale oval watching her prog- </p><p>ress. A humped dwarf leaned above </p><p>his shoulder, fingers suspended over his </p><p>lute-strings as he stared. On cushions </p><p>and low benches by the fire a handful </p><p>of women and girls, two young boys in </p><p>bright blue, a pair of greyhounds with </p><p>the firelight scarlet in their eyes—these </p><p>made up the rest of the company. </p><p> Jirel’s narrow yellow gaze summed</p><p>them up as she crossed th£ hall. Strid- </p><p>ing smoothly in her thigh-length hau- </p><p>berk, she knew she was a figure on </p><p>which a man’s eyes must linger. Her </p><p>supple height, the pleasant smooth </p><p>curves of her under mail, the long, </p><p>shapely legs bare beneath the linked </p><p>metal of her hauberk, the swinging of </p><p>the long sword whose weight upon its </p><p>belt pulled in her waist to tigerish slim- </p><p>ness—Alaric’s eyes missed nothing of </p><p>all these. Deliberately she tossed the </p><p>dark cloak back over her shoulders, </p><p>letting the firelight take the sleek </p><p>mailed curves of her in a bright glim- </p><p>mer, flash from the shining greaves </p><p>that clasped her calves. It was not her </p><p>way to postpone the inevitable. Let </p><p>Alaric learn in his first long stare how </p><p>splendid a creature was Joiry’s lady. </p><p>And as for those women at his feet— </p><p>well, let them know too. </p><p> She swaggered to a halt before</p><p>Alaric, resting a hand on her sword- </p><p>hilt, tossing back the cloak that had </p><p>swirled about her as she swung to a </p><p>stop. His face, half in the shadow of </p><p>the chair, tilted up to her leanly. Here </p><p>was no burly brute of a man such as she </p><p>had half expected on the evidence of </p><p>the men-at-arms he kept. He was of</p><p>middle years, his face deeply grooved </p><p>with living, his nose a hawk-beak, his </p><p>mouth a sword-gash. </p><p> And there was something oddly</p><p>wrong with his features, a queer cast </p><p>upon them that made him seem akin </p><p>to the purple-clad courtier hovering at </p><p>Jirel’s elbow, to the grinning jester who </p><p>peered across the chair-back. With a </p><p>little twist of the heart she saw what </p><p>it was. There was no physical likeness </p><p>between master and men in any feature, </p><p>but the shadow of deformity lay upon </p><p>all three faces, though only the hunch- </p><p>back wore it honestly. Looking at those </p><p>faces, one would have sworn that each </p><p>of the trio went limping through life </p><p>under the burden of a crooked spine. </p><p>Perhaps, Jirel thought involuntarily, </p><p>with a small shudder, the master and </p><p>the courtier as well as the fool did in- </p><p>deed carry a burden, and if they did she </p><p>thought she would prefer the jester’s to </p><p>theirs. His at least was honest and of </p><p>the flesh. But theirs must be of the </p><p>spirit, for surely, she thought again, </p><p>God in his wisdom does not for noth- </p><p>ing mark a whole and healthy man with </p><p>a cripple’s face. It was a deformity </p><p>of the soul that looked out of the eyes </p><p>meeting hers. </p><p> And because the thought frightened</p><p>her she swung her shoulders until the </p><p>cape swirled wide, and flashed her </p><p>white teeth in a smile more boldly reck- </p><p>less than the girl behind it felt. </p><p> “You must not crave the company of</p><p>strangers, sir—you keep a discourag- </p><p>ing guard before your gate !” </p><p> Alaric did not smile. “Honest trav-</p><p>elers are welcome here,” he said very </p><p>smoothly. “But the next robbers who </p><p>ride our causeway will think twice be- </p><p>44 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>fore they storm the gates. We have </p><p>no gallows here where thieves may </p><p>swing in chains, but I think the guard </p><p>before my castle will be warning enough </p><p>to the next raiders who come.” </p><p> “A grisly sort of warning,” said</p><p>Jirel. And then, with belated courtesy, </p><p>“I am Jirel of Joiry. I missed my way </p><p>in the marsh tonight—I shall be grate- </p><p>ful for your hospitality.” </p><p> “And we for your presence, Lady</p><p>Jirel.” ^ </p><p> Alaric’s voice was oily, but his</p><p>eyes raked her openly. She felt other </p><p>eyes upon her back too, and her red </p><p>hair stiffened a little at the roots with a </p><p>prickling uneasiness. “We keep a small </p><p>court here at Hellsgarde,” went on </p><p>Alaric’s voice. “Damara, Ettard, </p><p>Isoud, Morgaine—all of you, make </p><p>our guest welcome!” </p><p>Tlrel swung round with a swirl of </p><p>** her long cloak to face the women, </p><p>wrondering at the subtle slight to their </p><p>dignity, for Alaric made no effort to </p><p>introduce them separately. </p><p> She thought they crouched a little on</p><p>their low seats by the fire, looking up </p><p>with the queer effect of women peering </p><p>fearfully from under lowered brows, </p><p>though she coulcl not have said why </p><p>they seemed so, for they met her eyes </p><p>squarely. And upon these faces too lay </p><p>that strange shadow of deformity, not </p><p>so definitely as upon the men’s, but visi- </p><p>ble in the firelight. All of them were </p><p>thin creatures with big eyes showing </p><p>a rather shocking space of whiteness </p><p>around the staring irises. Their cheek- </p><p>bones were sharp in the firelight, so </p><p>that shadows stood hollowly beneath. </p><p> The woman who had risen when</p><p>Alaric said “Damara” was as tall as </p><p>Jirel, strongly made under her close </p><p>green gown, but her face too had that </p><p>queerly hollow look and her eyes stared </p><p>too whitely under wide-open lids. She </p><p>said in a tight voice:</p><p> “Sit down by the fire and warm your-</p><p>self, lady. We dine in a few minutes.” </p><p>Jirel sank to the low cushioned stool </p><p>she dragged forward, one leg doubled </p><p>under her for instant rising, her sword- </p><p>hilt and sword-hand free. There was </p><p>something wrong here. She could feel </p><p>it in the air. </p><p> The two dogs growled a little and</p><p>shifted away from her on the floor, </p><p>and even that was—wrong. Dogs had </p><p>fawned on her always—until now. And </p><p>the firelight was so red in their eyes---- </p><p> Looking away uneasily from those</p><p>unnaturally red eyes, she saw the boys’ </p><p>features clearly for the first time, and </p><p>her heart contracted a little. For naked </p><p>evil was upon these two young faces. </p><p>The others wore their shadow of de- </p><p>formity elusively, a thing more sensed </p><p>than seen. It might be only a trick of </p><p>her legend-fed imagination that put evil </p><p>there. But the two young lads had the </p><p>faces of devils, long faces with high </p><p>cheekbones and slitted, lusterless eyes. </p><p>Jirel shuddered a little inwardly. What </p><p>sort of company had she stumbled into, </p><p>where the very children and dogs wore </p><p>evil like a garment? </p><p> She drew a deep breath and glanced</p><p>around the circle of still faces that </p><p>watched her wordlessly, with an intent- </p><p>ness like that of—of beasts of prey? </p><p>Her pride rebelled at that. Joiry was </p><p>ever the predator, not the prey! She </p><p>squared her cleft chin and said with de- </p><p>termined casualness: </p><p> “You have dwelt here long?”</p><p> She could have sworn a look wTent</p><p>round the semicircle before the fire, a </p><p>swift, amused glance from face to face </p><p>as if they shared a secret. Yet not an </p><p>eye wavered from hers. Only the two </p><p>boys leaned together a little, and the </p><p>look of evil brightened upon their </p><p>HELLSGARDE </p><p>45 </p><p>wicked young faces. Alaric answered </p><p>after the briefest possible pause: </p><p> “Not long. Nor will we stay long</p><p>—now.” There was a subtle menace in </p><p>it, though Jirel could not have said </p><p>why. And again that feeling of knowl- </p><p>edge shared ran like a strong current </p><p>around the circle, a little quiver as if a </p><p>dreadful amusement were almost stir- </p><p>ring in the air. But not a face changed </p><p>or turned. The eyes were still eager— </p><p>almost avid—upon the bright, strong </p><p>face of Jirel with the firelight warming </p><p>her golden tan and touching her red </p><p>curls to flame and trembling upon the </p><p>soft curve of her under-lip. For all </p><p>the bright clothes of the company </p><p>around her, she had the sudden feel- </p><p>ing that dark robes and dark eyes and </p><p>dark faces hemmed her in—like shad- </p><p>ows around a fire. </p><p> The conversation had come to a full</p><p>stop; the eyes never wavered from her. </p><p>She could not fathom this strange in- </p><p>terest, for it was queer Alaric had not </p><p>asked anything at all about her coming. </p><p>A woman alone in this wilderness at </p><p>night was sufficiently unusual to arouse </p><p>interest, yet no one seemed concerned </p><p>to ask how she had come there. Why, </p><p>then, this concerted and deep interest </p><p>in the sight of her? </p><p> To conquer the little tremor she</p><p>could not quite ignore she said boldly: </p><p>“Hellsgarde of the Marshes has an </p><p>ugly reputation, my lord. I wonder you </p><p>dare dwell here—or do you know the </p><p>old tale?” </p><p> Unmistakably this time that quiver</p><p>of amusement flashed around the </p><p>circle, though not an eye left hers. </p><p>Alaric’s voice was dry as he answered: </p><p>“Yes—yes, we know the tale. We </p><p>are—not afraid.” </p><p> And suddenly Jirel was quite sure of</p><p>a strange thing. Something in his voice </p><p>and his words told her very surely that </p><p>they had not come in spite of the ter- </p><p>rible old legend, but because of it.</p><p> No normal people would deliber-</p><p>ately seek out a haunted and blood- </p><p>stained ruin for a dwelling-place, yet </p><p>there could be no mistaking the im- </p><p>plication in Alaric’s voice, in the un- </p><p>spoken mirth at her words that ran </p><p>like a whisper around the circle. She </p><p>remembered those dead men at the </p><p>door. What normal person could make </p><p>a joke so grisly? No, no—this com- </p><p>pany was as definitely abnormal as a </p><p>company of dwarfs or monsters. One </p><p>could not sit with them long even in si- </p><p>lence without sensing that. The look </p><p>of abnormality upon their faces did not </p><p>lie—it was a sure sign of a deformity </p><p>of the soul. </p><p>n^HE conversation had stopped again. </p><p>"*-To break the nerve-racking silence </p><p>Jirel said: </p><p> “We hear many strange tales of</p><p>Hellsgarde”—and knew she was talk- </p><p>ing too much, but could not stop—any- </p><p>thing was better than that staring si- </p><p>lence—“tales of treasure and—and—is </p><p>it true that one can come upon Hells- </p><p>garde Castle only in the sunset—as I </p><p>did?” </p><p> Alaric paused deliberately for a mo-</p><p>ment before he answered with as de- </p><p>liberate evasiveness, “There are </p><p>stranger tales than that of Hellsgarde </p><p>—and who can say how much of truth </p><p>is in them? Treasure? There may well </p><p>be treasure here. Many have come </p><p>seeking it—and remained, for ever.” </p><p> Jirel remembered the dead men at</p><p>the door, and she shot Alaric a yellow </p><p>glare that would have clanged like the </p><p>meeting of blades with his stare—had </p><p>he met it. Pie was looking up into the </p><p>shadows of the ceiling, and he was smil- </p><p>ing a little. Did he suspect her er- </p><p>rand? He had asked no questions.... </p><p>46 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>Jirel remembered Guy of Garlot’s smile </p><p>as he sent her on this quest, and a mur- </p><p>derous wonder began to take shape in </p><p>her mind. If Guy had known—if he </p><p>had deliberately sent her into this peril </p><p>—she let herself sink for a moment </p><p>into a luxury of picturing that comely </p><p>smile smashed in by the handle of her </p><p>sword. . . . </p><p> They were watching her. She came</p><p>back with a jerk and said at random: </p><p> “How cold the marshes are after</p><p>sunset!” And she shivered a little, not </p><p>until that moment realizing the chill of </p><p>the great hall. </p><p> “We find it—pleasant,” murmured</p><p>Alaric, watching her. </p><p> The others were watching too, and</p><p>again she sensed that ripple of subtle </p><p>amusement running around the circle </p><p>that closed her out of a secret shared. </p><p>They were here for a purpose. She </p><p>knew it suddenly: a strange, unfathom- </p><p>able purpose that bound them together </p><p>with almost one mind, so that thoughts </p><p>seemed to flow soundlessly from brain </p><p>to brain; a purpose that included her </p><p>now, and in no pleasant way. Danger </p><p>was in the air, and she alone here by </p><p>night in the deserted marshes, among </p><p>these queer, abnormal people who </p><p>watched her with an avid and unwaver- </p><p>ing eagerness. Well, she had been in </p><p>peril before, and hewed her way out </p><p>again. </p><p> A slovenly wench in a ragged smock</p><p>tiptoed clumsily out of the shadows to </p><p>murmur in Damara’s ear, and Jirel felt </p><p>with conscious relief the removal of at </p><p>least one pair of staring eyes as the </p><p>woman turned to nod. Jirel’s gaze was </p><p>scornful on the girl. A queer house- </p><p>hold they kept here—the bestial re- </p><p>tainers, the sluttish wench in her soiled </p><p>gown. </p><p> Not even Joiry’s kitchen maids went</p><p>so slovenly clad. </p><p> Damara turned back to the fire.</p><p>“Shall we dine now?” she asked. </p><p> Every face around the fire bright-</p><p>ened magically, and Jirel was conscious </p><p>of a little loosening of the tension in </p><p>her own mind. The very fact that the </p><p>thought of food pleased them made the </p><p>whole group seem more normal. And </p><p>yet—she saw it in a moment—this was </p><p>not even a normal eagerness. There </p><p>was something a little horrid about the </p><p>gleam in every eye, the avid hunger on </p><p>every face. For a little while the </p><p>thought of food supplanted herself in </p><p>their interest, and that terrible battery </p><p>of watchfulness forsook her. It was </p><p>like an actual weight lifted. She </p><p>breathed deeper. </p><p> Frowsy kitchen scullions and a pair</p><p>of unwashed girls wrere carrying in the </p><p>planks and trestles for the table, set- </p><p>ting it up by the fire. </p><p> “We dine alone,” Alaric was ex-</p><p>plaining as the group around the fire </p><p>reshifted itself to make way. It seemed </p><p>a witless sort of fastidiousness to Jirel, </p><p>particularly since they let themselves </p><p>be served by such shamefully unkempt </p><p>lackeys. Other households dined all </p><p>together, from lord to stable hands, at </p><p>the long T-shaped tables where the salt </p><p>divided noblesse from peasantry. But </p><p>perhaps Alaric dared not allow those </p><p>beast-wild men of his even that fa- </p><p>miliarity. And she was conscious of a </p><p>tiny disappointment that the company </p><p>of these staring, strange-faced people </p><p>was not to be leavened even by the brut- </p><p>ish earthiness of their retainers. The </p><p>men-at-arms seemed scarcely human, </p><p>but at least it was a normal, open sort </p><p>of brutality, something she could un- </p><p>derstand. </p><p> When the table was ready Alaric</p><p>seated her at his right hand, beside the </p><p>two evil-faced youngsters who sat pre- </p><p>ternaturaliy quiet. Young lads of that </p><p>HELLSGARDE </p><p>47 </p><p>age were scufflers and squirmers at </p><p>table in the company she knew. It was </p><p>another count of eeriness against them </p><p>that they scarcely moved save to reach </p><p>for food. </p><p> Who were they? she wondered.</p><p>Alaric’s sons? Pages or squires from </p><p>some noble family? She glanced around </p><p>the table in deepening bewilderment, </p><p>looking for signs of kinship on the </p><p>shadowed faces, finding nothing but </p><p>that twist of deformity to link the com- </p><p>pany together. Alaric had made no at- </p><p>tempt to introduce any of them, and she </p><p>could not guess what relationship bound </p><p>them all together in this close, unspoken </p><p>communion. She met the eyes of the </p><p>dwarf at Alaric’s elbow and looked </p><p>quickly away again, angry at his little </p><p>comprehending grin. He had been </p><p>watching her. </p><p> There was no conversation after the</p><p>meat was brought in. The whole com- </p><p>pany fell upon it with such a starved </p><p>eagerness that one might think they had </p><p>not dined in weeks before now. And </p><p>not even their food tasted right or nor- </p><p>mal. </p><p> It looked well enough, but there</p><p>was a subtle seasoning about it that </p><p>made Jirel gag and lay down her knife </p><p>after the first taste—a flavor almost of </p><p>decay, and a sort of burning bitterness </p><p>she could not put a name to, that lin- </p><p>gered on the tongue long after the food </p><p>itself was swallowed. Everything stank </p><p>of it, the roast, the bread, the few vege- </p><p>tables, even the bitter wine. </p><p> After a brave effort, for she was</p><p>hungry, Jirel gave up and made not </p><p>even the pretense of eating. She sat </p><p>with her arms folded on the table edge, </p><p>right hand hanging near her sword, </p><p>watching the ravenous company devour </p><p>their tainted food. It was no wonder, </p><p>she realized suddenly, that they ate </p><p>alone. Surely not even the dull palates </p><p>of their retainers could accept this re- </p><p>voltingly seasoned meat. </p><p> Alaric sat back at last in his high-</p><p>backed chair, wiping his dagger on a </p><p>morsel of bread. </p><p> “You do not hunger, Lady Jirel?”</p><p>he asked, tilting a brow at her still- </p><p>heaped trencher. She could not help </p><p>her little grimace as she glanced down. </p><p> “Not now,” she said, with wry</p><p>humor. </p><p> Alaric did not smile. He leaned for-</p><p>ward to pick up upon his dagger the </p><p>thick slab of roast before her, and </p><p>tossed it to the hearth. The two grey- </p><p>hounds streaked from beneath the table </p><p>to growl over it hungrily, and Alaric </p><p>glanced obliquely at Jirel, with a hint </p><p>of a one-sided smile, as he wiped the </p><p>knife again and sheathed it. </p><p> If he meant her to understand that</p><p>the dogs were included in this queer </p><p>closed circle of his, she caught it. Ob- </p><p>viously there had been a message in </p><p>that act and smile. </p><p>TTThen the table had been cleared </p><p>*	’ away and the last glimmer of sun-</p><p>set had faded from the high, narrow </p><p>slits of the windows, a sullen fellow in </p><p>frieze went around the hall with a long </p><p>pole-torch, lighting the cressets. </p><p> “Have you visited Hellsgarde be-</p><p>fore, my lady?” inquired Alaric. And </p><p>as Jirel shook her head, “Let me show </p><p>you the hall dien, and my forefathers’ </p><p>arms and shields. Who knows?—you </p><p>may find quarterings of your own </p><p>among our escutcheons.” </p><p> Jirel shuddered at the thought of</p><p>discovering even a remote kinship with </p><p>Hellsgarde’s dwellers, but she laid her </p><p>hand reluctantly on the arm he offered </p><p>and let him lead her away from the fire </p><p>out under the echoing vaults of the </p><p>hall where cressets brought the shad- </p><p>ows to life. </p><p>48 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> The hall was as Andred’s murderers</p><p>must have left it two centuries ago. </p><p>What shields and armor had not fallen </p><p>from the walls were thick with rust in </p><p>the damp air of the marshes, and the </p><p>tatters of pennons and tapestries had </p><p>long ago taken on a uniform color of </p><p>decay. But Alaric seemed to savor the </p><p>damp and the desolation as a normal </p><p>man might savor luxury. Slowly he led </p><p>her around the hall, and she could feel </p><p>the eyes of the company, who had re- </p><p>sumed their seats by the fire, follow </p><p>her all the way with one unwinking </p><p>stare. </p><p> The dwarf had taken up his lute</p><p>again and struck occasional chords in </p><p>the echoing silence of the hall, but ex- </p><p>cept for that there was no sound but </p><p>the fall of their feet on the rushless </p><p>flagstones and the murmur of Alaric’s </p><p>voice pointing out the vanished glories </p><p>of Hellsgarde Castle. </p><p> They paused at the side of the big</p><p>room farthest from the fire, and Alaric </p><p>said in an unctuous voice, his eyes seek- </p><p>ing Jirel’s with curious insistence: </p><p> “Here on this spot where we stand,</p><p>lady, died Andred of Llellsgarde two </p><p>hundred years ago.” </p><p> Jirel looked down involuntarily. Her</p><p>feet were planted on the great blotch </p><p>of a spreading stain that had the rough </p><p>outline of a beast with questing head </p><p>and paws outsprawled. It was a broad </p><p>stain, black and splattered upon the </p><p>stone. Andred must have been a big </p><p>man. He had bled terribly on that day </p><p>two centuries past. </p><p> Jirel felt her host’s eyes on her face</p><p>full of a queer anticipation, and she </p><p>caught her breath a little to speak, but </p><p>before she could utter a sound, quite </p><p>suddenly there was a riot of wind all </p><p>about them, shrieking out of nowhere </p><p>in a whirlwind gust that came raven- </p><p>ing with such fury that the cressets went </p><p>out all together in one breath and dark- </p><p>ness like a blow fell upon the hall.</p><p> In the instant of that blackness,</p><p>while the whole great hall was black </p><p>and vocal and bewildering with storm- </p><p>wind, as if he had been waiting avidly </p><p>for this moment all evening a man’s </p><p>arm seized Jirel in a grip like death </p><p>and a mouth came down upon hers in a </p><p>more savagely violent, wetly intimate </p><p>kiss than she had ever known before. </p><p>It all burst upon her so quickly that her </p><p>impressions confused and ran together </p><p>into one gust of terrible anger against </p><p>Alaric as she struggled helplessly </p><p>against that iron arm and ravenous </p><p>mouth, while the storm wind shrieked </p><p>in the darkness. She was conscious of </p><p>nothing but the arm, the mouth, the </p><p>insolent hand. She was not pressed </p><p>against a man’s body, but the strength </p><p>of the arm was like steel about her. </p><p> And in the same moment of the seiz-</p><p>ure the arm was dragging her violendy </p><p>across the floor with irresistible force, </p><p>never slackening its crushing grip, the </p><p>kiss in all its revolting intimacy still </p><p>ravaging her muted mouth. It was as </p><p>if the kiss, the crush of the arm, the </p><p>violence of the hand, the howl of the </p><p>wind and the drag across die room were </p><p>all but manifestations of a single vortex </p><p>of violence. </p><p> It could not have lasted more than</p><p>seconds. She had an impression of big, </p><p>square, wide-spaced teeth against her </p><p>lips and the queer violence behind them </p><p>manifest not primarily in the savage- </p><p>ness of the kiss or the embrace, or the </p><p>wild drag across the room, but more </p><p>as if all these were mere incidents to a </p><p>burning vehemence behind them that </p><p>beat like heat all around her. </p><p> Choking with impotent fury, she</p><p>tried to struggle, tried to scream. But </p><p>there was no chest to push for leverage </p><p>and no body to arch away from, and </p><p>HELLSGARDE </p><p>49 </p><p>she could not resist. She could only </p><p>make dumb animal sounds in her throat, </p><p>sealed in behind the storming violation </p><p>of that mouth. </p><p> She had scarcely time to think, it</p><p>happened so quickly. She was too </p><p>stunned by the violence and suddenness </p><p>of the attack even to wonder at the ab- </p><p>sence of anything but the mouth, the </p><p>arm, the hand. But she did have the </p><p>distinct impression of walls closing in </p><p>around her, as if she were being </p><p>dragged out of the great open hall into </p><p>a narrow closet. It was somehow as if </p><p>that violence beating all about her were </p><p>confined and made more violent by the </p><p>presence oi close walls very near. </p><p> It was all over so quickly that even</p><p>as that feeling of closing walls dawned </p><p>upon her she heard the little amazed </p><p>cries of the others as the cressets were </p><p>blown out all together. It was as if </p><p>time had moved faster for her than for </p><p>them. In another instant someone must </p><p>have thrown brush on the fire, for the </p><p>great blaze in the cavern of the chim- </p><p>ney roared up with a gush of light and </p><p>sound, for a moment beating back the </p><p>darkness in the hall. </p><p> And Jirel was staggering alone in</p><p>the center of the big room. No one </p><p>was near her, though she could have </p><p>sworn upon the cross-hilt of her sword </p><p>that a split second before the heavy </p><p>mouth had crushed her muted lips. It </p><p>was gone now as if it had never been. </p><p>Walls did not enclose her; there was no </p><p>wind, there was no sound in the great </p><p>hall. </p><p> Alaric stood over the black blotch</p><p>of Andred’s blood at the other side of </p><p>the hall. She thought she must have </p><p>known subconsciously after the first </p><p>moment that it was not he whose lips </p><p>ravaged her bruised mouth. That flam- </p><p>ing vehemence was not in him. No, </p><p>though he had been the only man near </p><p>her when the dark closed down, he was </p><p>not the man whose outrageous kiss still </p><p>throbbed on her mouth.</p><p>Ohe lifted an unsteady hand to those </p><p>^ bruised lips and stared around her </p><p>wildly, gasping for lost breath, half </p><p>sobbing with fury. </p><p> The others were still around the fire,</p><p>half the width of the room away. And </p><p>as the light from the replenished blaze </p><p>leaped up, she saw the blankness of </p><p>their momentary surprise vanish before </p><p>one leaping flame of avid hope that for </p><p>an instant lit every face alike. With </p><p>long running strides Alaric reached her </p><p>side. In her dazed confusion she felt </p><p>his hands on her arms shaking her eag- </p><p>erly, heard him gabbling in a tongue </p><p>she did not know: </p><p> “G’hasta-est? Tai g’hasta? Tai</p><p>g’hasta?” </p><p> Angrily she shook him off as the</p><p>others closed round her in an eagerly </p><p>excited group, babbling all together, </p><p>“G’hasta tai? Est g’hasta?” </p><p> Alaric recovered his poise first. In</p><p>a voice shaking with the first emotion </p><p>she had heard from him he demanded </p><p>with almost desperate eagerness. </p><p> “What was it? What happened?</p><p>Was it—was it-?” But he seemed </p><p>scarcely to dare name the thing his </p><p>whole soul longed for, though the </p><p>tremble of hope was in his voice. </p><p> Jirel caught herself on the verge of</p><p>answering. Deliberately she paused to </p><p>fight clown the dizzy weakness that still </p><p>swam in her brain, drooping her lids to </p><p>hide the calculation that came up like </p><p>a flame behind her yellow eyes. For </p><p>the first time she had a leverage over </p><p>these mysterious people. She knew </p><p>something they frantically desired to </p><p>know, and she must make full use of </p><p>the knowledge she scarcely knew she </p><p>had. </p><p>50 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> “H-happened?” The stammer was</p><p>not entirely feigned. “There was a—a </p><p>wind, and darkness—I don’t know— </p><p>it was all over so quickly.” And she </p><p>glanced up into the gloom with not </p><p>wholly assumed terror. Whatever that </p><p>thing had been — it was no human </p><p>agency. She could have sworn that the </p><p>instant before the light flared up, walls </p><p>were closing around her as tightly as a </p><p>tomb’s walls; yet they had vanished </p><p>more lightly than mist in the glow of </p><p>the fire. But that mouth upon hers, </p><p>those big, squarely spaced teeth against </p><p>her lips, the crush of the brutal arm— </p><p>nothing could have been more tangible. </p><p>Yet there had been only the arm, the </p><p>mouth, the hand. No body. . . . With </p><p>a sudden shudder that made the goose- </p><p>flesh ripple along her limbs she remem- </p><p>bered that Andred had been dismem- </p><p>bered before they flung him into the </p><p>quicksands. . . . Andred. . . . </p><p> She did not know she had said it</p><p>aloud, but Alaric pounced like a cat on </p><p>the one word that left her lips. </p><p>“Andred? Was it Andred?” </p><p> Jirel recovered herself with a real</p><p>effort, clenching her teeth to stop their </p><p>chattering. </p><p> “Andred? He died two hundred</p><p>years ago!” </p><p> “He will never die until-” One</p><p>of the young boys with the evil faces </p><p>said that much before Alaric whirled </p><p>on him angrily, yet with curious defer- </p><p>ence. </p><p> “Silence! Wait! . . . Lady Jirel, you</p><p>asked me if the legends of Hellsgarde </p><p>are true. Now I tell you that the tale of </p><p>Andred is. We believe he still walks </p><p>the halls where his treasure lies hid, </p><p>and we—we-” He hesitated, and </p><p>Jirel saw a strange look of calculation </p><p>dawn upon his face. He went on </p><p>smoothly, “We believe there is but one </p><p>way to find that treasure. Only the</p><p>ghost of Andred can lead us there. And </p><p>Andred’s ghost has been—elusive, un- </p><p>til now.” </p><p> She could have sworn that he had</p><p>not meant to say just that when he be- </p><p>gan to speak. She was surer of it when </p><p>she saw the little flicker of communica- </p><p>tion ripple around the circle of faces </p><p>closing her in. Amusement at a subtle </p><p>jest in which she did not share ... it </p><p>was on every face around her, the hol- </p><p>low-cheeked women's white-rimmed, </p><p>staring eyes brightened, the men’s faces </p><p>twitched a little with concealed mirth. </p><p>Suddenly she felt smothered by abnor- </p><p>mality and mystery and that subtle, </p><p>perilous amusement without reason. </p><p> She was more shaken by her terrify-</p><p>ing experience than she would have </p><p>cared to admit. She had little need to </p><p>feign weakness as she turned away </p><p>from them toward the fire, eager to es- </p><p>cape their terrible company even </p><p>though it meant solitude in this haunted </p><p>dark. She said: </p><p> “Let me—rest by the fire. Perhaps</p><p>it—it—he won’t return.” </p><p> “But he must return!” She thought</p><p>that nearly every voice around her </p><p>spoke simultaneously, and eager agree- </p><p>ment was bright upon every face. Even </p><p>the two dogs had thrust themselves for- </p><p>ward among the legs of the little crowd </p><p>around Jirel, and their shadowed eyes, </p><p>still faintly aglow as if with borrowed </p><p>firelight, followed the conversation </p><p>from face to face as if they too under- </p><p>stood. Their gaze turned redly up to </p><p>Alaric now as he said: </p><p> “For many nights we have waited</p><p>in vain for the force that was Andred </p><p>to make itself known to us. Not until </p><p>you come does he create that vortex </p><p>which—which is necessary if we are to </p><p>find the treasure.” Again, at that word, </p><p>Jirel thought she felt a little current of </p><p>amusement ripple from listener to lis- </p><p>HELLSGARDE </p><p>tener. Alaric went on in his smooth </p><p>voice, “We are fortunate to find one </p><p>who has the gift of summoning An- </p><p>dred’s spirit to Hellsgarde. I think </p><p>there must be in you a kindred fierce- </p><p>ness which Andred senses and seeks. </p><p>We must call him out of the dark again </p><p>—and we must use your power to do </p><p>it.” </p><p> Jirel stared around her incredu-</p><p>lously. “You would call—that—up </p><p>again?” </p><p> Eyes gleamed at her with a glow that</p><p>was not of the firelight “We would </p><p>indeed,” murmured the evil-faced boy </p><p>at her elbow. “And we will not wait </p><p>much longer. ...” </p><p> “But—God’s Mercy!” said Jirel,</p><p>“—are all the legends wrong? They </p><p>say Andred’s spirit swoops down with </p><p>sudden death on all who trespass in </p><p>Hellsgarde. Why do you talk as if </p><p>only I could evoke it? Do you want </p><p>to die so terribly? I do not! I won’t </p><p>endure that again if you kill me for it. </p><p>I’ll have no more of Andred’s kisses!” </p><p>rjlHERE was a pulse of silence around </p><p>-““•the circle for a moment. Eyes met </p><p>and looked away again. Then Alaric </p><p>said: </p><p> “Andred resents only outsiders in</p><p>Hellsgarde, not his own kinsmen and </p><p>their retainers. Moreover, those leg- </p><p>ends you speak of are old ones, telling </p><p>tales of long-ago trespassers in this </p><p>castle. </p><p> “With the passage of years the</p><p>spirits of the violent dead draw farther </p><p>and farther away from their death- </p><p>scenes. Andred is long dead, and he </p><p>revisits Hellsgarde Castle less often </p><p>and less vindictively as the years go by. </p><p>We have striven a long while to draw </p><p>him bac^—but you alone succeeded. </p><p>No, lady, you must endure Andred’s </p><p>violence once again, or-” </p><p> “Or what?” demanded Jirel coldly,</p><p>dropping her hand to her sword. </p><p> “There is no alternative.” Alaric’s</p><p>voice was inflexible. “We are many to </p><p>your one. We will hold you here until </p><p>Andred comes again.” </p><p> Jirel laughed. “You think Joiry’s</p><p>men will let her vanish without a trace? </p><p>You’ll have such a storming about </p><p>Hellsgarde walls as-” </p><p> “I think not, lady. What soldiers</p><p>will dare follow when a braver one </p><p>than any of them was vanished in Hells- </p><p>garde? No, Joiry, your men will not </p><p>seek you here. You-” </p><p> Jirel’s sword flamed in the firelight</p><p>as she sprang backward, dragging it </p><p>clear. The blade flashed once—and </p><p>then arms like iron pinioned her from </p><p>behind. For a dreadful moment she </p><p>thought they were Andred’s, and her </p><p>heart turned over. But Alaric smiled, </p><p>and she knew. It was the dwarf who </p><p>had slipped behind her at an unspoken </p><p>message from his master, and if his </p><p>back was weak his arms were not. He </p><p>had a bear’s grip upon her and she </p><p>could not wrench herself free. </p><p> Struggling, sobbing curses, kicking</p><p>hard with her steel-spurred heels, she </p><p>could not break his hold. There was a </p><p>murmurous' babble all around her of </p><p>that strange, haunting tongue again, </p><p>“L’vraista! Tai g'hasta vrai! El </p><p>vraistf tai lau!” And the two devil- </p><p>faced boys dived for her ankles. They </p><p>clung like ghoulishly grinning apes, pin- </p><p>ning her feet to the floor. And Alaric </p><p>stepped forward to wrench the sword </p><p>from her hand. He murmured some- </p><p>thing in their queer speech, ancl the </p><p>crowd scattered purposefully. </p><p> Fighting hard, Jirel was scarcely</p><p>aware of their intention before it was </p><p>accomplished. But she heard the sud- </p><p>den splash of water on blazing logs and </p><p>the tremendous hissing of steam as the </p><p>52 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>fire went out and darkness fell like a </p><p>blanket upon the shadowy hall. The </p><p>crowd had melted away from her into </p><p>the dark, and now the grip on her </p><p>ankles suddenly ceased and the great </p><p>arms that held her so hard heaved in a </p><p>mighty swing. </p><p> Choking with fury, she reeled into</p><p>the darkness. There was nothing to </p><p>stop her, and those mighty arms had </p><p>thrown her hard. She fell and slid help- </p><p>lessly across bare flagstones in black </p><p>dark, her greaves and empty scabbard </p><p>clanging upon stone. When she came </p><p>to a halt, bruised and scratched and </p><p>breathless, it was a moment before she </p><p>could collect her senses enough to </p><p>scramble up, too stunned even for </p><p>curses. </p><p> “Stay where you are, Jirel of Joiry,”</p><p>Alaric's voice said calmly out of the </p><p>blackness. “You cannot escape this </p><p>hall—we guard every exit with drawn </p><p>swords. Stand still—and wait.” </p><p> Jirel got her breath and launched</p><p>into a blasphemous survey of his ances- </p><p>try and possible progeny with such ve- </p><p>hemence that the dark for several min- </p><p>utes throbbed with her fury. Then she </p><p>recalled Alaric’s suggestion that vio- </p><p>lence in herself might attract a kindred </p><p>violence in that strange force called An- </p><p>dred, and she ceased so abruptly that </p><p>the silence was like a blow upon the </p><p>ears. </p><p> It was a silence full of tense waiting.</p><p>She could almost feel the patience and </p><p>the anticipation that beat out upon her </p><p>from the circle of invisible jailers, and </p><p>at the thought of what they waited her </p><p>blood ran chilly. She looked up blindly </p><p>into the darkness overhead, certain for </p><p>a long and dreadful moment that the </p><p>familiar blast of storm-wind was gath- </p><p>ering there to churn the night into chaos </p><p>out of which Andred’s arm would </p><p>reach. . . , </p><p> After a while she said in a voice that</p><p>sounded unexpectedly small in the dark- </p><p>ness :</p><p> “Y-you might throw me a pillow. I’m</p><p>tired of standing and this floor’s cold.” </p><p> To her surprise footsteps moved</p><p>softly and quite surely across stone, and </p><p>after a moment a pillow hurtled out of </p><p>the darkness to thump softly at her </p><p>feet. Jirel sank upon it thankfully, </p><p>only to stiffen an instant later and glare </p><p>about her in the dark, the hair prickling </p><p>on her neck. So—they could see in the </p><p>darkness! There had been too much </p><p>certainty in those footsteps and the ac- </p><p>curate toss of the pillow to doubt it. </p><p>She huddled her shoulders together a </p><p>little and tried not to think. </p><p> The darkness was enormous above</p><p>her. Age upon age went by, with no </p><p>sound except her own soft breathing to </p><p>break that quiet pulsing with waiting </p><p>and anticipation. Her terror grew. </p><p>Suppose that dreadful storm-wind </p><p>should come whooping through the hall </p><p>again; suppose the bodiless arm should </p><p>seize her and the mouth come ravening </p><p>down upon her lips once more. . . . </p><p>Coldness crept down her spine. </p><p> Yes, and suppose it did come again.</p><p>What use, for her ? These slinking ab- </p><p>normalities who were her jailers would </p><p>never share the treasure with her which </p><p>they were so avid to And—so avid that </p><p>they dared evoke this terror by night </p><p>and brave a death which legend whis- </p><p>pered fearfully of, simply that they </p><p>might possess it. It—did they know, </p><p>then, what lay in Andred’s terribly </p><p>guarded box? What conceivable thing </p><p>could be so precious that men would </p><p>dare this to have it? </p><p> And what hope at all for her? If the</p><p>monstrous thing called Andred did not </p><p>come tonight — then he would come </p><p>again some other night, sooner or later, </p><p>and all nights would find her isolated </p><p>HELLSGARDE </p><p>53 </p><p>here as bait for the monster that </p><p>haunted Hellsgarde. She had boasted </p><p>without hope when she said her men </p><p>would follow. They were brave men </p><p>and they loved her—but they loved liv- </p><p>ing more. No, there was not a man in </p><p>Joiry who would dare follow where she </p><p>had failed. She remembered Guy of </p><p>Garlot’s face, and let violence come </p><p>flooding up in her for a moment. That </p><p>handsome coward, goading her into </p><p>this that he might possess the nameless </p><p>thing he coveted. . . . Well, she would </p><p>ruin his comely face for him with the </p><p>cross-hilt of her sword—if she lived. </p><p>If she lived! She was forgetting. . . . </p><p>Olowly the stars wheeled by the ar- </p><p>^ row-slit windows high up in the </p><p>darkness of the walls. Jirel sat hugging </p><p>her knees and watching them. The </p><p>darkness sighed above her with vagrant </p><p>drafts, any one of which might be An- </p><p>dred roaring down out of the night. . .. </p><p> Well, her captors had made one mis-</p><p>take. How much it might avail her </p><p>she did not know, but they thought they </p><p>had disarmed her, and Jirel hugged </p><p>her greave-sheathed legs in the dark- </p><p>ness and smiled a wicked smile, know- </p><p>ing they had not. </p><p> It must have been after midnight,</p><p>and Jirel dozing uneasily with her head </p><p>on her knees, when a long sigh from </p><p>the darkness made her start awake. </p><p>Alaric’s voice, heavy with weariness </p><p>and disappointment, spoke in his name- </p><p>less language. It occurred to Jirel to </p><p>wonder briefly that though this seemed </p><p>to be their mother tongue (for they </p><p>spoke it under stress and among them- </p><p>selves), yet their speech with her had </p><p>no taint of accent. It was strange— </p><p>but she was beyond wondering long </p><p>about the monstrous folk among whom </p><p>she had fallen. </p><p> Footsteps approached her, walking</p><p> unerringly. Jirel shook herself awake</p><p>and stood up, stretching cramped </p><p>limbs. Hands seized her arms from </p><p>both sides—at the first grasp, with no</p><p>groping, though even her dark-accus- </p><p>tomed eyes could see nothing. No one </p><p>bothered to translate Alaric’s speech to </p><p>her, but she realized that they had </p><p>given up their vigil for the night. She </p><p>was too drugged with sleep to care. </p><p>Even her terror had dulled as the end- </p><p>less night hours dragged by. She stum- </p><p>bled along between her captors, making </p><p>no effort to resist. This was not the </p><p>time to betray her hidden weapon, not </p><p>to these people who walked the dark </p><p>like cats. She would wait until the odds </p><p>were evener. </p><p> No one troubled to strike a light.</p><p>They went swiftly and unhesitatingly </p><p>through the blackness, and when stairs </p><p>rose unexpectedly underfoot Jirel was </p><p>the only one who stumbled. Up steps, </p><p>along a cold and echoing hall—and </p><p>then a sudden thrust that sent her stag- </p><p>gering. A stone wall caught her and a </p><p>door slammed at her back. She whirled, </p><p>a hot Norman oath smoking on her </p><p>lips, and knew that she was alone. </p><p> Groping, she made out the narrow</p><p>confines of her prison. There was a </p><p>cot, a jug of water, a rough door </p><p>through whose chinks light began to </p><p>glimmer even as she ran questing hands </p><p>across its surface. Voices spoke briefly </p><p>outside, and in a moment she under- </p><p>stood. Alaric had summoned one of his </p><p>apish men to watch her while he and his </p><p>people slept. She knew it must be a </p><p>man-at-arms and not one of Alaric’s </p><p>company, for the fellow had brought a </p><p>lantern with him. She wondered if the </p><p>guardsmen knew how unerringly their </p><p>masters walked the darkness—or if </p><p>they cared. But it no longer seemed </p><p>strange to her that Alaric dared em- </p><p>ploy such brutish men. She knew well </p><p>54 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> enough now with what ease he could</p><p>control them—he and his night-sight </p><p>and his terrible fearlessness. </p><p> Silence fell outside. Jirel smiled a</p><p>thin smile and leaned into the nearest </p><p>corner, drawing up one knee. The </p><p>long, thin-bladed knife she carried be- </p><p>tween greave and leg slid noiselessly </p><p>from its sheath. She waited with feline </p><p>patience, her eyes upon the lighted </p><p>chinks between the door’s planks. </p><p> It seemed a long while before the</p><p>guard ceased his muffled pacing, </p><p>yawned loudly, tested the bar that fas- </p><p>tened the door from without. Jirel’s </p><p>thin smile widened. The man grunted </p><p>and—she had prayed he would—set- </p><p>tled down at last on the floor with his </p><p>back against the panels of her door. </p><p>She knew he meant to sleep awhile in </p><p>the certainty that the door could not be </p><p>opened without waking him. She had </p><p>caught her own guards at that trick too </p><p>often not to expect it now. </p><p> Still she waited. Presently the even</p><p>breath of slumber reached her ears, </p><p>and she licked her lips and murmured, </p><p>“Gentle Jesu, let him not wear mail!” </p><p>and leaned to the door. Her knife was </p><p>thin enough to slide easily between the </p><p>panels. . . . He was not wearing mail— </p><p>and the blade was razor-keen. He must </p><p>scarcely have felt it, or known when </p><p>he died. She felt the knife grate against </p><p>bone and gave it an expert twist to clear </p><p>the rib it had grazed, and heard the </p><p>man give a sudden, startled grunt in </p><p>his sleep, and then a long sigh. . . . He </p><p>must never have awakened. In a mo- </p><p>ment blood began to gush through the </p><p>panels of the door in heavy spurts, and </p><p>Jirel smiled pleasantly and withdrew </p><p>her knife. </p><p> It was simple enough to lift the bar</p><p>with that narrow blade. The difficulty </p><p>was in opening the door against the </p><p>dead weight of the man outside, but she </p><p> accomplished that too, without too</p><p>much noise—and then the lantern sat </p><p>waiting for her and the hall was long</p><p>and empty in the half-dark. She could </p><p>see the arch of the stairway and knew </p><p>the way she had come. And she did </p><p>not hesitate on the way down. She had </p><p>thought it all out carefully in the dark- </p><p>ness of the hall downstairs while she </p><p>crouched on the cushion and waited for </p><p>Andred’s ravenous storm-blast to come </p><p>shrieking down above her bent shoul- </p><p>ders. </p><p> There was no way out. She knew</p><p>that. Other castles had posterns and </p><p>windows from which a fugitive might </p><p>escape, but quicksands surrounded </p><p>Hellsgarde and the only path to free- </p><p>dom lay along the causeway where </p><p>Alaric’s guard would be watching to* </p><p>night. And only in romances does a </p><p>lone adventurer escape through a </p><p>guarded courtyard and a guarded gate. </p><p> And too—she had come here for a</p><p>purpose. It was her duty to find that </p><p>small treasured box which alone would </p><p>buy the twenty lives depending on her. </p><p>She would do that, or die. And per- </p><p>haps, after all, it was fortunate that the </p><p>castle had not been empty when she </p><p>came. Without Alaric, it might never </p><p>have occurred to her to dare the power </p><p>of Andred’s ghost in order to reach her </p><p>goal. She realized now that it might </p><p>well be the only way she would ever suc- </p><p>ceed. Too many searchers in the past </p><p>had ransacked Hellsgarde Castle to </p><p>leave her much hope unless great luck </p><p>attended her. But Alaric had said it: </p><p>there was a way—a terrible and deadly </p><p>perilous way, but the only hope. </p><p> And after all, what chance did she</p><p>have? To sit supinely waiting, a help- </p><p>less decoy, until the night when An- </p><p>dred’s power swooped down to claim </p><p>her again—or to seek him out deliber- </p><p>ately and challenge him to the duel. </p><p>HELLSGARDE </p><p>55 </p><p>The end would be the same—she must </p><p>suffer his presence again, either way. </p><p>But tonight there was a bare chance </p><p>for her to escape with the treasure- </p><p>casket, or at least to find it alone and </p><p>if she lived to hide it and bargain with </p><p>Alaric for freedom. </p><p> It was a forlorn and futile hope, she</p><p>knew well. But it was not in her to sit </p><p>waiting for death, and this way there </p><p>was at least a bare hope for success. </p><p>She gripped her bloody knife in one </p><p>hand and her lantern in the other and </p><p>went on down the stairs, cat-footed and </p><p>quick. </p><p>TTer little circle of light moving with </p><p>her across the cold flags was so </p><p>tenuous a defense against the dark. One </p><p>gust of Andred’s storm-wind would puff </p><p>it out and the darkness would smash in </p><p>upon her like a blow. And there were </p><p>other ghosts here than Andred’s— </p><p>small, cold things in the dark just be- </p><p>yond her lantern light. She could feel </p><p>their presence as she picked her way </p><p>across the great hall, past the quenched </p><p>logs of the fireplace, past the crumbling </p><p>ruins oi armor and tapestry, toward </p><p>the one spot where she thought she </p><p>might be surest of summoning up the </p><p>dreadful thing she sought. </p><p> It was not easy to find. She ranged</p><p>back and forth for many minutes with </p><p>her little circle of light before a corner </p><p>of that great black splotch she hunted </p><p>moved into the light; beast-shaped, </p><p>dark as murder itself upon the flag- </p><p>stones Andred’s life-blood spilled two </p><p>hundred years ago. </p><p> Here once before that ravening</p><p>ghost had taken her; here if anywhere, </p><p>surely he would come again. She had </p><p>her underlip firmly between her teeth </p><p>as she stepped upon that stain, and she </p><p>was holding her breath without realiz- </p><p>ing it. She must have stood there for a </p><p>full minute, feeling the goose-flesh </p><p>shudder along her limbs, before she </p><p>could nerve herself for the thing she </p><p>must do next. But she had come too</p><p>far to fail herself now. She drew a deep </p><p>breath and blew out the lifted lantern. </p><p> Darkness crashed upon her with the</p><p>impact of a physical blow, almost </p><p>squeezing the breath from her body. </p><p>And now suddenly fright was past and </p><p>the familiar winy exultation of tension </p><p>before battle rushed along her limbs </p><p>and she looked up into the darkness de- </p><p>fiantly and shouted to the great vaults </p><p>of the ceiling, “Come out of Hell, dead </p><p>Andred! Come if you dare, Andred the </p><p>Damned!” </p><p> Wind—wind and storm and vio-</p><p>lence ! It snatched the words from her </p><p>lips and the breath from her throat in </p><p>one tremendous whirling gust that came </p><p>rushing out of nowhere. And in the </p><p>instant of its coming, while the wild </p><p>challenge still echoed on her lips, a </p><p>ravenous mouth came storming down </p><p>to silence hers and a great arm smacked </p><p>down around her shoulders in a blow </p><p>that sent her reeling as iron fingers dug </p><p>agonizingly into her arm—a blow that </p><p>sent her reeling but would not let her </p><p>fall, for that terrible drag again was </p><p>sweeping her across the floor with a </p><p>speed that ran faster than time itself. </p><p> She had ducked her head instinc-</p><p>tively when she felt the arm seize her, </p><p>but not soon enough. The heavy mouth </p><p>had hers, and again the square, wide- </p><p>set teeth were bruising her lips and the </p><p>violence of the monstrous kiss made </p><p>fury bubble up in her sealed throat as </p><p>she fought in vain against it. </p><p> This time the thing was not such a</p><p>stunning surprise, and she could sense </p><p>more clearly what was happening to </p><p>her. As before, the whole violent fury </p><p>of the attack burst upon her at once— </p><p>the mouth seized hers and the arm </p><p>56 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>swept her almost off her feet in the </p><p>same instant, and in that instant the un- </p><p>slacking grip around her shoulders </p><p>rushed her across the dark floor, </p><p>blinded in the blackness, deafened by </p><p>the raving wind, muted and dazed by </p><p>the terrible vehemence of the mouth </p><p>and the pain of her iron-clawed arm. </p><p>But she could sense dimly again that </p><p>walls were closing around her, closer </p><p>and closer, like a tomb’s walls. And as </p><p>before she was aware of a tremendous </p><p>force beating about her, a greater vio- </p><p>lence than any one manifestation of it </p><p>upon her body; for the mouth, the grip- </p><p>ping hand, the arm, the sweeping drag </p><p>itself were all but parts of that vortex. </p><p> And it was indeed a vortex—it was</p><p>somehow spinning and narrowing as if </p><p>the whole force that was Andrecl were </p><p>concentrating into one tornado-whirl of </p><p>savage power. Perhaps it was that feel- </p><p>ing of narrowing and vortexing rota- </p><p>tion which made walls seem to draw </p><p>close about her. It was all too dimly </p><p>sensed a thing to put clearly into words, </p><p>and yet it was terribly real. Jirel, </p><p>breathless and bruised and stunned with </p><p>pain and violence, still knew clearly </p><p>that here in the midst of the great open </p><p>hall walls were drawing prison-tight </p><p>about her. </p><p> Savagely she slashed at the arm</p><p>around her shoulders, at the steel-fin- </p><p>gered hand digging her arm to the </p><p>bone. But the angle was an awkward </p><p>one and she was too dazed to know if </p><p>she cut flesh or simply stabbed at dis- </p><p>embodied force. And the grip did not </p><p>slacken; the storming mouth still held </p><p>hers in a kiss so wild and infuriating </p><p>that she could have sobbed with pure </p><p>rage. </p><p> Those walls were very near . . . her</p><p>stumbling knees touched stone. She </p><p>groped dizzily with her free hand and </p><p>felt walls dripping-damp, close around </p><p>her. The forward motion had ceased, </p><p>and the power which was Andred </p><p>whirled in one concentrated cone of </p><p>violence that stopped her breath and</p><p>sent the darkness reeling around her. </p><p> Through the haze of her confusion</p><p>she knew that this, then, must be his </p><p>own place to which he had dragged </p><p>her, a place of stone and damp and </p><p>darkness somewhere outside—for they </p><p>had reached it too quickly for it to be </p><p>a real place—and yet it was tangible. </p><p>. . . Stone walls cold against her hands, </p><p>and what were these round and slipping </p><p>things underfoot?—things that rattled </p><p>a little as she stumbled among them— </p><p>bones? Dear God, the bones of other </p><p>seekers after treasure, who had found </p><p>what they sought? For she thought </p><p>the treasure-box must be here, surely, </p><p>if it were anywhere at all—here in this </p><p>darkness unreachable save through the </p><p>very heart of the whirlwind. . . . </p><p>TTER senses were failing and the whirl </p><p>that was like the whirl in a tor- </p><p>nado’s heart seemed to create a vacuum </p><p>which drew her out of her body in one </p><p>thin, protesting wisp of self that had no </p><p>strength to fight. . . . </p><p> Somewhere a long way off was her</p><p>body, hanging limp in the clutch of the </p><p>iron arm, gasping for breath under a </p><p>kiss that made reality faint about her, </p><p>still struggling feebly in some tomb- </p><p>smelling, narrow place where stone </p><p>walls dripped and bones turned under- </p><p>foot—the bones of those who had come </p><p>before her. . . . </p><p> But she was not there. She was a</p><p>wispy wraith rooted only tenuously in </p><p>that fainting body, a wraith that reeled </p><p>out and out in a thin skein to spin on </p><p>the whirls of tornado-violencc pulling </p><p>her farther and farther and farther </p><p>away. . . . The darkness was slipping </p><p>sidewise—the stone walls were a prison </p><p>HELLSGARDE </p><p>57 </p><p>no longer, for she was moving up along </p><p>the great expanding whirl that sucked </p><p>her out of her body, up and out around </p><p>widening circles into night-time dis- </p><p>tances where space and time were </p><p>not. . . . </p><p> Somewhere infinitely far away a foot</p><p>that was not hers stumbled over some- </p><p>thing small and square, and a body that </p><p>was not hers slid to its knees among </p><p>wet, rattling bones, and a bosom that </p><p>was not hers bruised itself on the cor- </p><p>ner of that square something as the </p><p>tenantless body fell forward among </p><p>bones upon a wet stone floor. But upon </p><p>the widening whorls of the vortex the </p><p>wisp that was Jirel rebelled in its spin- </p><p>ning. She must go back—she must re- </p><p>member—there was something—some- </p><p>thing. . . . </p><p> For one fleeting instant she was in</p><p>her body again, crumpled down upon </p><p>the stones, arms sprawled about a small </p><p>square thing that was slimy to the </p><p>touch. A box—a wet leather box thick </p><p>with fungus, bound with iron. Andred’s </p><p>box, that for two hundred years search- </p><p>ers had hunted in vain. The box that </p><p>Andred had died for and that she </p><p>would die for too—was dying for now </p><p>in the darkness and the damp among </p><p>the bones, with violence ravening down </p><p>to seize her again. . . . </p><p> Dimly, as her senses left her for the</p><p>second time, she heard a dog bark, </p><p>high and hysterically, from far above. </p><p>And another dog answered, and then </p><p>she heard a man’s voice shouting in a </p><p>tongue she did not know, a wild, exul- </p><p>tant shout, choking with triumph. But </p><p>after that the dizziness of the whirl- </p><p>wind which snatched her out of her </p><p>body made everything blur, until— </p><p>until-- </p><p> Queerly, it was music that brought</p><p>her back. A lute’s strings singing as if </p><p>madness itself swept wild chords across </p><p>them. The dwarfed jester’s lute, </p><p>shrieking with music that wakened her </p><p>out of nowhere into her own fallen</p><p>body in the dampness and the dark </p><p>where that hard box-corner bruised her </p><p>bosom. </p><p> And the whirlwind was—uncoiling</p><p>—from about her. The walls widened </p><p>until she was no longer aware of their </p><p>prison closeness and the smell of damp </p><p>and decay faded from her nostrils. In </p><p>a dizzy flash of realization she clasped </p><p>the wet casket to her breast just as the </p><p>walls faded altogether and she sat up </p><p>unsteadily, blinking into the dark. </p><p> The whirlwind still raved around</p><p>her, but somehow, strangely, it did not </p><p>touch her now. No, there was some- </p><p>thing outside it—some strong force </p><p>against which it battled—a force that </p><p>—that- </p><p> She was in the dark hall again.</p><p>Somehow she knew it. And the wild </p><p>lute-music shrilled and sang, and in </p><p>some queer way—she saw. It was dark </p><p>still—but she saw. For a luminous </p><p>glow was generating itself in a ring </p><p>around her and by its ghostlight she </p><p>was aware—scarcely through sight— </p><p>of familiar faces spinning past her in a </p><p>wide, whirling ring. A witch dance, </p><p>round and round. . . . Alaric’s lined </p><p>face flashed by, blazing with exultation ; </p><p>Damara’s wThite-ringed e.yes glared </p><p>blindly into the dark. She saw the two </p><p>boys whirl past, the light of hell itself </p><p>luminous on their faces. There was a </p><p>wild bark, and one of the greyhounds </p><p>loped by her and away, firelight from </p><p>no earthly flame glaring in its eyes, its </p><p>tongue lolling in a canine grin of </p><p>ecstasy. Round and round her through </p><p>that luminous glow which was scarcely </p><p>light the mad circle spun. And ever </p><p>the lute-strings wailed and sang with a </p><p>wilder music than strings can ever have </p><p>sung before, and the terrible joy on </p><p>58 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>every face—yes, even upon the dogs’ </p><p>—was more frightening than even </p><p>Andred’s menace had been. </p><p> Andred—Andred. . . . The power</p><p>of his volcano-force spun above her </p><p>now, with a strength that stirred the </p><p>red hair against her cheeks and a rav- </p><p>ing of wind through which the lute </p><p>music screamed high. But it was not </p><p>the full force that had overwhelmed </p><p>her. For this maniac dance that spun </p><p>round and round through the dark was </p><p>building up a climax of cumulative </p><p>strength that she could feel as she knelt </p><p>there, hugging the slimy box. She </p><p>thought the very air sang with tension </p><p>and stress. That circle was reeling </p><p>counterwise to the spin of Andred’s </p><p>vortexing force, and Andred was weak- </p><p>ening. She could feel him slackening </p><p>above her in the dark. The music </p><p>shrieked louder above the failing </p><p>storm-wind and the fearful joy upon </p><p>those faces whirling past told her why. </p><p>Somehow they were overpowering him. </p><p>Something in the dwarf’s mad lute- </p><p>strings, something in the spinning of </p><p>their dance was breaking down the </p><p>strength of Andred’s centuries-old vio- </p><p>lence. She could feel it weakening as </p><p>she crouched there with the casket </p><p>hugged bruisingly to her bosom. </p><p> And yet—was it this precious casket</p><p>that they fought for? No one had a </p><p>glance to spare for the crouching girl </p><p>or the burden she hugged. Every face </p><p>was lifted raptly, every eye stared </p><p>blindly and exultantly into the upper </p><p>dark as if the thing that was Andred </p><p>were visible and—and infinitely desir- </p><p>able. It was a lust for that thing upon </p><p>their faces that made joy so vivid there. </p><p>Jirel’s brain had almost ceased record- </p><p>ing sensation in the bewilderment of </p><p>what she watched. </p><p> When the dance ended she scarcely</p><p>knew it. Lulled into a dizzy trance by </p><p>the mad spinning of the dancers, she </p><p>was almost nodding on her knees in </p><p>their center, feeling her brain whirl </p><p>with their whirling—feeling the motion</p><p>slow about her so imperceptibly that </p><p>nothing but the whirl itself registered </p><p>on her mind. But the dancers were </p><p>slackening—and with them, the whirl </p><p>above. The wind no longer raved </p><p>through the dark; it was a slow sigh </p><p>now, growing softer and gentler as the </p><p>circle of dancers ceased to spin. . .. </p><p> And then there was a great, soft,</p><p>puffing sigh from the darkness above </p><p>her that blew out her awareness like a </p><p>candle-flame. . . . </p><p>T'VAYLIGHT fingering through the ar- </p><p>row-slits touched Jirel’s closed lids. </p><p>She awoke painfully, blinking in the </p><p>light. Every muscle and bone of her </p><p>supple body ached from the buffeting </p><p>of last night's storm and violence, and </p><p>the cold stones were hard beneath her. </p><p>She sat up, groping by instinct for her </p><p>knife. It lay a little distance off, rusting </p><p>with last night’s blood. And the casket </p><p>—the casket! — </p><p> Panic swelling in her throat quieted</p><p>in an instant as she saw that precious, </p><p>molding thing lying on its side at her </p><p>elbow. A little thing, its iron hinges </p><p>rusty, its leather whitened and eaten </p><p>with rot from two centuries in a name- </p><p>less, dripping place; but safe, unopened. </p><p>She picked it up, shaking it experimen- </p><p>tally. And she heard the softest shift- </p><p>ing within, a sound and weight like </p><p>finest flour moving gently. </p><p> A rustle and a sigh from beyond</p><p>brought her head up, and she stared </p><p>around her in the shadows of the hall. </p><p>In a broad, uneven circle the bodies of </p><p>last night’s dancers lay sprawled. </p><p>Dead? No, slow breathing stirred </p><p>them as they lay, and upon the face of </p><p>the nearest—it was Damara—was a </p><p>HELLSGARDE </p><p>59 </p><p>look of such glutted satiety that Jirel </p><p>glanced away in disgust. But they all </p><p>shared it. She had seen revelers asleep </p><p>after a night of drunken feasting with </p><p>not half such surfeit, such almost ob- </p><p>scene satisfaction upon their faces as </p><p>Alaric’s drugged company wore now. </p><p>Remembering that obscure lusting she </p><p>had seen in their eyes last night, she </p><p>wondered what nameless satiety they </p><p>had achieved in the dark after her own </p><p>consciousness went out. . . . </p><p> A footfall sounded upon stone be-</p><p>hind her and she spun half-way round, </p><p>rising on one knee and shifting the </p><p>knife-hilt firmer in her fist. It was </p><p>Alaric, a little unsteady on his feet, </p><p>looking down upon her with a sort of </p><p>half-seeing abstraction. His scarlet </p><p>tunic was dusty and rumpled as if he </p><p>had slept in it all night upon the floor </p><p>and had only just risen. He ran a hand </p><p>through his ruffled hair and yawned, </p><p>and looked down at her with a visible </p><p>effort at focusing his attention. </p><p> “I’ll have your horse brought up,”</p><p>he said, his eyes sliding indifferently </p><p>away from her even as he spoke. “You </p><p>may go now.” </p><p> Jirel gaped up at him, her lips part-</p><p>ing in amazement over white teeth. He </p><p>was not watching her. His eyes had </p><p>shifted focus and he was staring blindly </p><p>into some delightful memory that had </p><p>blotted out Jirel’s very existence. And </p><p>upon his face that look of almost ob- </p><p>scene satiety relaxed every feature until </p><p>even his sword-gash mouth hung loose. </p><p> “B-but-” Jirel blinked and</p><p>clutched at the mildewed box she had </p><p>risked her life for. He came back into </p><p>focus for an impatient instant to say </p><p>carelessly: </p><p> “Oh—that! Take the silly thing.”</p><p> “You—you know what it is? I</p><p>thought you wanted-” </p><p> He shrugged. “I could not have</p><p>explained to you last night what it was </p><p>I wanted of—Andred. So I said it </p><p>was the treasure we sought—you could </p><p>understand that. But as for that rot- </p><p>ting little box—I don’t know or care </p><p>what lies inside. I’ve had—a better </p><p>thing. ...” And his remembering eyes </p><p>shifted again to escape hers and stare </p><p>blissfully into the past. </p><p> “Then w-why did you—save me?”</p><p>“Save you?” He laughed. “We </p><p>had no thought of you or your treas- </p><p>ure in what we—did—last night. You </p><p>have served your purpose—you may </p><p>go free.” </p><p> “Served—what purpose?”</p><p>Impatiently for an instant he brought </p><p>himself wholly back out of his remem- </p><p>bering dream to say: </p><p> “You did what we were holding you</p><p>for-—called up Andred into our power. </p><p>Lucky for you that the dogs sensed </p><p>what happened after you had slipped </p><p>off to dare the ghost alone. And lucky </p><p>for us, too. I think Andred might not </p><p>have come even to take you, had he </p><p>sensed our presence. Make no doubt </p><p>of it—he feared us, and with good </p><p>reason.” </p><p> Jirel looked up at him for a long in-</p><p>stant, a little chill creeping down her </p><p>spine, before she said in a shaken whis- </p><p>per: </p><p> “What—are you?” And for a mo-</p><p>ment she almost hoped he would not </p><p>answer. But he smiled, and the look of </p><p>deformity deepened upon his face. </p><p> “A hunter of undeath,” he said</p><p>softly. “A drinker of undeath, when </p><p>I can find it. . . . My people and I lust </p><p>after that dark force which the ghosts </p><p>of the violent dead engender, and we </p><p>travel far sometimes between—feast- </p><p>ings.” His eyes escaped hers for an </p><p>instant to stare gloatingly into the past. </p><p>Still looking with that unfocused gaze, </p><p>in a voice she had not heard before </p><p>60 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>from him, he murmured, “I wonder if </p><p>any man who has not tasted it could </p><p>guess the utter ecstasy of drinking up </p><p>the undeath of a strong ghost ... a </p><p>ghost as strong as Andred’s . . . feeling </p><p>that black power pouring into you in </p><p>deep drafts as you suck it down — a </p><p>thirst that strengthens as you drink— </p><p>fee 1 — darkness — spreading through </p><p>every vein more sweetly than wine, </p><p>more intoxicating. ... To be drunk on </p><p>undeath—a joy almost unbearable.” </p><p> Watching him, Jirel was aware of a</p><p>strong shudder that rose in the pit of </p><p>her stomach and ran strongly and shak- </p><p>ingly along her limbs. With an effort </p><p>she tore her gaze away. The obscene </p><p>ecstasy that Alaric’s inward-looking </p><p>eyes dwelt upon was a thing she would </p><p>not see even in retrospect, through an- </p><p>other’s words and eyes. She scrambled </p><p>to her feet, cradling the leather box in </p><p>her arm, averting her eyes from his. </p><p> “Let me go, then,” she said in a low-</p><p>ered voice, obscurely embarrassed as </p><p>if she had looked inadvertently upon </p><p>something indescribable. Alaric glanced </p><p>up at her and smiled. </p><p> “You are free to go,’’ he said, “but</p><p>waste no time returning with your men </p><p>for vengeance against the force we im- </p><p>posed on you.” His smile deepened at </p><p>her little twitch of acknowledgment, </p><p>for that thought had been in her mind. </p><p>“Nothing holds us now at Hellsgarde. </p><p>We will leave today on — another </p><p>search. One thing before you go—we </p><p>owe you a debt for luring Andred into </p><p>our power, for I think he would not </p><p>have come without you. Take a warn- </p><p>ing away with you, lady.” </p><p> “What is it?” Jirel’s gaze flicked</p><p>the man’s briefly and fell again. She </p><p>would not look into his eyes if she could </p><p>help it. “What warning?” </p><p> “Do not open that box you carry.”</p><p> And before she could get her breath</p><p>to speak he had smiled at her and </p><p>turned away, whistling for his men.</p><p>Around her on the floor Jirel heard a </p><p>rustling and a sigh as the sleepers be- </p><p>gan to stir. She stood quiet for an in- </p><p>stant longer, staring down in bewilder- </p><p>ment at the small box under her arm, </p><p>before she turned to follow Alaric into </p><p>the outer air. </p><p>T AST night was a memory and a </p><p>nightmare to forget. Not even the </p><p>dead men still on their ghastly guard </p><p>before the door could mar her triumph </p><p>now. </p><p> Jirel rode back across the cause-</p><p>way in the strong light of morning, </p><p>moving like a rider in a mirage between </p><p>blue skies and blue reflecting waters. </p><p>Behind her Hellsgarde Castle was a </p><p>vision swimming among the mirroring </p><p>pools of the marsh. And as she rode, </p><p>she remembered. </p><p> The vortex of violence out of which</p><p>she had snatched this box last night— </p><p>the power and terror of the thing that </p><p>had treasured it so long . . . what lay </p><p>within? Something akin to—Andred? </p><p>Alaric might not know, but he had </p><p>guessed. . . . His warning still sounded </p><p>in her ears. </p><p> She rode awhile with bent brows, but</p><p>presently a wicked little smile began to </p><p>thin the red lips of Joiry’s sovereign </p><p>lady. Well . . . she had suffered much </p><p>for Guy of Garlot, but she thought now </p><p>that she would not smash in his hand- </p><p>some, grinning lace with her sword-hilt </p><p>as she had dreamed so luxuriously of </p><p>doing. No . . . she would have a better </p><p>vengeance. . . . </p><p> She would hand him a little iron-</p><p>bound leather box. </p><p>rmies from the Past </p><p>By EDMOND HAMILTON </p><p>"Kim Idim still reached back into the past.” </p><p>A weird-scientific tale of adventure, and the clash of armed men—an </p><p>exciting story of time-travel and a world enslaved—a narrative </p><p>of our planet two million years hence </p><p>ETHAN DREW stood in the </p><p>lamplit living-room of his pent- </p><p>house apartment staring up at </p><p>the sword. There was a yearning long- </p><p>ing in his brown, aquiline face and </p><p>brooding gray eyes as he gazed at the </p><p>weapon. Slowly he reached up and </p><p>took it down from above the stone fire- </p><p>place. </p><p> It was a long, gleaming saber, its</p><p>hilt and the back of its blade nicked </p><p>and scarred. Lovingly he ran his fin- </p><p>ger along those scars that spoke with </p><p>mute eloquence of desperate battle. </p><p> €1</p><p>62 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>And die brooding loneliness in his dark </p><p>face deepened. </p><p> “Swain, and Pedro Lopez, and all</p><p>die rest,” he whispered. “And Chiri— </p><p>if I could only see them all again-” </p><p> Then sick hopelessness came over</p><p>his features. His tall, broad-shoul- </p><p>dered figure sagged. </p><p> “No,” he muttered dully, “That</p><p>was all a million years away.” </p><p> A million years!</p><p> Holding the sword tightly, Ethan</p><p>Drew no longer saw the luxurious, </p><p>lamp lit room about him. He was look- </p><p>ing into memory now—into memory </p><p>of the future. </p><p> He saw himself as he had been two</p><p>years before, Private Ethan Drew of </p><p>the French Foreign Legion, ambushed </p><p>with a patrol of his comrades by Arab </p><p>raiders in the deep Sahara, his com- </p><p>panions all dead, and he, the last sur- </p><p>vivor, about to be killed, when sud- </p><p>denly the miracle had happened. </p><p> There had been a blaze of light and</p><p>force about him, and he had known </p><p>nothing more. And when he had awak- </p><p>ened, it had been in a strange place and </p><p>a strange time—a time a million years </p><p>in the future. </p><p> Fie had been drawn across those</p><p>ages of time by Kim Idim, old scientist </p><p>of that far day, and Chiri, his slim, </p><p>lovely daughter. And five other men </p><p>had been drawn out of past ages by </p><p>the old scientist, too—five fighting-men </p><p>of different times, snatched across the </p><p>abyss of the ages by the old scientist’s </p><p>potent time-ray. </p><p> Hank Martin, Rocky Mountain</p><p>trapper of Kit Carson’s day; John </p><p>Crewe, Puritan soldier of the army of </p><p>Oliver Cromwell; Pedro Lopez, Span- </p><p>ish conquistador of the troops of Cor- </p><p>tez; Swain Njallson, huge Viking sea- </p><p>raider of the Tenth Century; and Ptah,</p><p>soldier of the armies of ancient Egypt; </p><p>these were the five who had been drawn </p><p>out of their own times into the future, </p><p>the same as Ethan Drew. </p><p> Ethan had found them staunch and</p><p>loyal comrades, those five warriors </p><p>from the past. Together, he and they </p><p>had dared the perils of that far future </p><p>time. </p><p> Together, they had helped the</p><p>girl Chiri save her father, Kim Idim. </p><p>from those who meant to use the old </p><p>scientist’s time-ray for evil purposes. </p><p> And at the last, when the very land</p><p>was sinking under them all into the sea, </p><p>old Kim Idim had saved the six com- </p><p>rades from death by sending them </p><p>back, each to his own time. Ethan </p><p>Drew had awakened once more in the </p><p>Sahara, in the very year and day from </p><p>which he had been drawn. </p><p> What had happened to Kim Idim</p><p>and Chiri? That question had been a </p><p>throbbing wonder in Ethan’s mind ever </p><p>since. Had the old scientist and his </p><p>daughter escaped into some still fur- </p><p>ther time in Earth’s future, as they had </p><p>planned? Or had they been engulfed </p><p>by the catastrophe of the sinking con- </p><p>tinent, and met their deaths? </p><p> He did not know. Fie would never</p><p>know, and that realization was a cold </p><p>ache in his heart. He would never </p><p>again fight shoulder to shoulder with </p><p>those five loyal comrades from the past. </p><p>He would never again see Chiri, that </p><p>lovely girl of the far future whom he </p><p>had learned to love. </p><p> Ethan turned slowly. Still holding</p><p>the sword, he stepped wearily through </p><p>the open French doors onto the terrace </p><p>of his penthouse. He stood there </p><p>against the parapet, gazing with hope- </p><p>less longing into the night. </p><p> New York slept, a vast pattern of</p><p>twinkling lights, stretched under dark, </p><p>low-hanging banks of cloud. West- </p><p>ward, against the cloud-curtain, glided </p><p>ARMIES FROM THE PAST </p><p>63 </p><p>the red and green lights of the late </p><p>Miami plane. </p><p> “Chiri!” whispered Ethan, his lips</p><p>hardly pronouncing the name. </p><p> Suddenly he stiffened. He sensed a</p><p>change in the atmosphere, a strange, </p><p>swiftly gathering hush and tension, a </p><p>murmur as of unfamiliar forces. </p><p> Fie did not understand. But his</p><p>gray eyes were suddenly brilliant with </p><p>dawning excitement, with incredulous </p><p>hope. </p><p> “Chiri?” he repeated tensely.</p><p> Then it happened. A blaze of light,</p><p>a crash of thunder, all about him. And </p><p>he was hurled into darkness. </p><p>rpHE clash of swords and hoarse </p><p>-^-■shouts of fighting men broke on </p><p>Ethan’s ears as he came back to con- </p><p>sciousness. Bewilderedly he opened </p><p>his eyes. He lay in a small metal room </p><p>whose high windows admitted a flood </p><p>of dusky, deep red sunlight quite un- </p><p>like the sunlight of his own time. </p><p> He was lying beside a squat machine</p><p>of singularly grotesque appearance, </p><p>crowned by a world-map globe. With </p><p>a wild leap of gladness, Ethan recog- </p><p>nized the mechanism. It was such a </p><p>time-ray projector as once before had </p><p>been used to draw him out of his own </p><p>age into the future. </p><p> Then two heads bent frantically over</p><p>him. It was an old man and a girl, </p><p>both dressed in short white robes. He </p><p>recognized the gray hair, thin, lined </p><p>face and faded blue eyes of the man </p><p>instantly. And his eyes swung to the </p><p>girl’s face, soft and lovely under a </p><p>cloud of midnight hair, her red lips </p><p>parted and dark eyes wide with anxiety. </p><p> “Chiri!” he cried, stumbling to his</p><p>feet. “And Kim Idim! You’ve drawn </p><p>me across time again, then? For two </p><p>long years I’ve hoped and prayed that </p><p>you would!”</p><p> The girl Chiri flew into his arms.</p><p> “Ethan, we are in danger!” she</p><p>gasped. “This is a time two million </p><p>years in the future from your age. My </p><p>father and I fled into this time after </p><p>the destruction of Tzar—and now the </p><p>Masters who rule Earth in this age </p><p>are seeking with their slaves to cap- </p><p>ture us!” </p><p> “That is why I drew you and your</p><p>comrades out of the past again!” Kim </p><p>Idim cried. “Only from time could I </p><p>summon help, when the Masters at- </p><p>tacked us here!” </p><p> Ethan Drew turned, appalled.</p><p>Through the open door of the little </p><p>metal house he saw a strange scene. </p><p> Outside lay a weird and unearthly</p><p>forest of huge green toadstools, tow- </p><p>ering in the dusky light of the wester- </p><p>ing red sun. And out of this grotesque </p><p>toadstool forest, white-skinned men in </p><p>armor and helmets were surging with </p><p>uplifted swords toward the little house. </p><p> Behind them, urging them on, were</p><p>a few leaders of totally different ap- </p><p>pearance. They were tall, red-skinned </p><p>men with spindly arms and legs, huge </p><p>chests and high, hairless skulls from </p><p>whose cadaverous faces looked hollow </p><p>white eyes. These Masters did not </p><p>look entirely human! </p><p> Fighting with the white slaves of the</p><p>Masters, holding them back from the </p><p>house, stood five men: a tall figure in </p><p>buckskin and coon cap, wielding a </p><p>clubbed rifle; a Spanish trooper in hel- </p><p>met and cuirass, swearing as he struck </p><p>with his sword; a big Puritan in felt hat </p><p>and homespun uniform swinging an </p><p>enormous broadsword; a huge Viking </p><p>whirling a gleaming ax; and a small, </p><p>wiry Egyptian in bronze, stabbing vi- </p><p>ciously. </p><p> “It’s Swain, and Hank Martin, and</p><p>all the rest!” cried Ethan joyfully, </p><p>starting toward the door. </p><p>64 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> “Yes, I drew them like you out of</p><p>time when the Masters first attacked </p><p>our dwelling!” Kim Idim exclaimed. </p><p> “You and Chiri wait here,” Ethan</p><p>ordered. And clutching the sword </p><p>which he had unconsciously brought </p><p>across time with him, he ran out and </p><p>plunged into the fight. </p><p>, Two of the white warriors were </p><p>/pressing the buckskin-clad frontiersman </p><p>hard. Ethan fell upon the two from </p><p>one side before they realized his pres- </p><p>ence. </p><p> Two terrific stabbing strokes—and</p><p>the two warriors reeled back with their </p><p>throats gaping and spurting red. Hank </p><p>Martin, the tall trapper, spun around, </p><p>and his leathery brown face lighted up </p><p>as he recognized Ethan Drew. </p><p> “It’s young Drew, pardners!” he</p><p>called to the others. “Kim Idim’s </p><p>yanked him across time again, too!” </p><p>“Greetings, comrade!” yelled Pedro </p><p>Lopez as he fought. The Spanish con- </p><p>quistador swore violently as his sword </p><p>flashed. “Name of God, now we’re all </p><p>here we’ll gut these cursed scum!” </p><p>“Cease your godless profanity, Lo- </p><p>pez!” boomed the stern voice of John </p><p>Crewe, the big Puritan, through the </p><p>clashing conflict. “It is no time, when </p><p>our lives are in peril, to take the Lord’s </p><p>name in vain.” </p><p> “Osiris, will the dogs never quit at-</p><p>tacking?” panted Ptah, the little Egyp- </p><p>tian, stabbing furiously with his bronze </p><p>shortsword. </p><p> But Swain Njallson, his blond hair</p><p>flowing wildly from beneath his horned </p><p>helmet, his icy blue eyes gleaming, ut- </p><p>tered a deep, rumbling laugh as he </p><p>smote with his great ax. </p><p> “Ho, comrade, this is living again f”</p><p>he cried to Ethan. </p><p> All Ethan Drew’s swordsmanship</p><p>came swiftly back into his brain and </p><p>muscles as he stabbed and hacked.</p><p>There were still a half-dozen of the </p><p>white warriors facing them, attacking </p><p>fiercely at the urging of the red Mas- </p><p>ters behind them. </p><p> Pedro Lopez slipped on bloody grass</p><p>and went down. Two warriors leaped </p><p>in like cats to strike at the fallen Span- </p><p>iard. But Hank Martin’s rifle-butt </p><p>crashed down on the helmet of one, and </p><p>Lopez, on his knees, stabbed up in a </p><p>ripping stroke that disemboweled the </p><p>other. </p><p> “Haw! Haw!” guffawed the buck-</p><p>skin trapper. “Can’t ye stand up and </p><p>fight like a man, Pedro?” </p><p> “Let me at them!” roared the Span-</p><p>iard, rushing forward like a maddened </p><p>bull. “Sangre de Cristo, I’ll-” </p><p> “They’re giving way!” boomed John</p><p>Crewe’s triumphant shout, his massive </p><p>face flaming with battle-light. </p><p> The few remaining warriors were</p><p>retreating, for the urging shouts of the </p><p>red Masters had stopped—the un- </p><p>human red-skinned leaders had melted </p><p>back into the forest and vanished. </p><p> But as Ethan and his comrades</p><p>fiercely pressed these last opponents, a </p><p>scream came from the house. </p><p> “Ethan!” shrilled Chiri’s silver voice.</p><p> Ethan Drew spun around. He</p><p>shouted hoarsely at what he saw. The </p><p>four red Masters had penetrated the </p><p>little metal house from the rear, were </p><p>dragging Chiri and Kim Idim out of </p><p>the back. </p><p> Yelling, Ethan ran back toward the</p><p>house, his bloody sword raised. He </p><p>burst through its two small chambers </p><p>and out the door in the rear. </p><p> There were horses there—the Mas-</p><p>ters had mounted them and were drag- </p><p>ging the stunned old man and the wild- </p><p>cat-struggling girl up with them. And </p><p>as Ethan rushed wildly at them, the </p><p>leader of the four Masters yelled an </p><p>order.</p><p>ARMIES FROM THE PAST </p><p>65 </p><p>^Phe four steeds dashed away into the </p><p>dusky gloom of the grotesque toad- </p><p>stool forest. Ethan ran wildly after </p><p>them, but in a moment they were out </p><p>of sight. The cries of Chiri receded </p><p>into the distance. </p><p> Flis dark face contorted, his gray</p><p>eyes wild, Ethan ran back around to </p><p>the front of the little house. The last </p><p>of the white warriors there had fallen, </p><p>and Hank Martin and the others were </p><p>coming running to meet him. </p><p> “Those red devils have got Chiri</p><p>and Kim Idim!” Ethan cried hoarsely. </p><p>“While we fought here, they slipped </p><p>around and into the back of the house. </p><p>They rode toward the west—we’ve got </p><p>to follow!” </p><p> “Of course!” shouted Pedro Lopez</p><p>fiercely, starting instantly forward. </p><p>“Por Dios, they’ll regret the day they </p><p>dared molest the friends of a cavalier </p><p>of Spain!” </p><p> Swain and John Crewe also started</p><p>unhesitatingly forward with Ethan. </p><p>But Ptah held them back, the little </p><p>Egyptian’s dark, crafty face urgent in </p><p>expression. </p><p> “Wait!” he cried. “If they were</p><p>mounted, we cannot soon overtake </p><p>them. And by rushing blindly after </p><p>them without knowing where we go, </p><p>we shall but run ourselves into peril.” </p><p>“Ptah’s right,” drawled Hank Mar- </p><p>tin keenly. “We need to get hosses </p><p>somewhere. And we need to find out </p><p>where they’ll have likely taken Kim </p><p>Idim and the gal.” </p><p> Ethan saw the force of their reason-</p><p>ing, yet every fiber in him quivered with </p><p>the urge to rush at once through the </p><p>toadstool forest after the red abduc- </p><p>tors. </p><p> For two long years Ethan had</p><p>dreamed of seeing Chiri once more. </p><p>And now, when that dream had come </p><p>true, when he had even held her for a </p><p>moment in his arms, she had been </p><p>snatched from him to an unguessable </p><p>fate. </p><p> “I think one of them white warriors</p><p>ain’t quite dead yet,” Hank Martin </p><p>was saying. “We might larn somethin' </p><p>from him.” </p><p> They hurried back to the dozen</p><p>sprawled bodies on the trampled grass. </p><p>The lanky trapper turned one of them </p><p>over. It was a warrior whose breast </p><p>bled from two gaping wounds, but </p><p>whose eyes were still open. </p><p> The dying man glared up at them in</p><p>hate, as they bent over him. Ethan </p><p>spoke to him, using the language of </p><p>Tzar which he had learned in the age </p><p>a million years before this, and which </p><p>he hoped was still spoken in this fur- </p><p>ther time. </p><p> “Where did you and your Master?</p><p>come from?” he asked tensely. </p><p> “From the city Luun—dog!” gasped</p><p>the dying man, in a tongue much the </p><p>same as that which Ethan had used. </p><p> “Where is Luun? And who rules</p><p>there, you whites or the red Masters?” </p><p>Ethan exclaimed. </p><p> “The Masters rule, of course,” mut-</p><p>tered the Luunian warrior. “Ever since </p><p>they came to Earth a hundred thousand </p><p>years ago, the Masters have been the </p><p>rightful rulers of this world and we </p><p>humans serve them willingly in our </p><p>cities, of which Luun is the greatest. </p><p> “The city Luun,” the gasping voice</p><p>continued, “lies a half-day’s march </p><p>from here across the great plain that </p><p>stretches west of this forest. It was </p><p>from Luun that we came today, to cap- </p><p>ture the old man and girl who the Mas- </p><p>ters had heard were living alone in this </p><p>forest.” </p><p> The Luunian raised himself by a con-</p><p>vulsive effort, and his dimming eyes </p><p>glared up at them in undying hate. </p><p> “I have told you the way to Luun,</p><p>66 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>because I know that if you go there the </p><p>Masters will slay you all, as befits men </p><p>who dare rebel against their sacred </p><p>rule.” </p><p> Before Ethan could speak again, the</p><p>Luunian fell back, dead. The six com- </p><p>rades got to their feet. </p><p> “It shore amazes me,” drawled</p><p>Hank Martin, “that these white men </p><p>would let them red devils rule them. </p><p>You heard him—even when he was </p><p>passin’ in his checks, he claimed it was </p><p>right and fittin’ for the Masters to </p><p>rule.” </p><p> “The Masters must be wizards,”</p><p>said John Crewe gloomily. “Aye, </p><p>demons who by compact with Satan </p><p>have somehow enslaved the races of </p><p>man.” </p><p> “Monsters, devils or what-not, I’m</p><p>going to Luun after them!'’ Ethan ex- </p><p>claimed passionately. “Chiri and her </p><p>father are not going to be their slaves. </p><p>You others can come or not, as you see </p><p>fit.” </p><p> “If any of you is not willing to</p><p>come,” roared Pedro Lopez, his mus- </p><p>tachios twitching and his florid face </p><p>menacing, “he’ll measure swords with </p><p>me, here and now.” </p><p> “Aw, cool off, Pedro,” drawled the</p><p>trapper calmly. “We’re all with Drew, </p><p>and he knows it.” </p><p> “Aye,” rumbled Swain, a glitter in</p><p>his eye. “There should be fighting in </p><p>plenty in such a city.” </p><p> “Hear how the heathen lusts for</p><p>blood,” John Crewe said with stern dis- </p><p>approval, glowering at Swain. </p><p> “He’s wrong—we’re not going to</p><p>try to fight our way into Luun,” Ethan </p><p>said swiftly. “That would be hopeless. </p><p>We’ll have to enter by stealth, under </p><p>cover of darkness, and seek out Chiri </p><p>and her father and spirit them away.” </p><p> “Then why not don the armor of</p><p>these dead men?” cried Ptah, pointing </p><p>to the slain Luunians. “In such guise, </p><p>we could far more easily penetrate </p><p>Luun undetected.” </p><p> Although Ethan was chafing at the</p><p>delay, he saw the force of the sugges- </p><p>tion. </p><p> “We’ll do it,” he said. “Quick,</p><p>men!” </p><p> John Crewe frowned disapprovingly</p><p>at the armor that Ptah was already </p><p>stripping from the slain men. </p><p> “Is a Christian man to wear such</p><p>pagan attire as that?” he demanded. </p><p> “What matters our dress, so long as</p><p>we carry our good swords?” Pedro Lo- </p><p>pez retorted. “When we cavaliers of </p><p>Spain followed Don Hernando up into </p><p>Mexico, we were glad at times to wear </p><p>even the cotton armor of the Aztecs.” </p><p>Tn a few minutes, all stood attired in </p><p>■L ’the metal armor of the dead Luun- </p><p>ians, though Swain’s great limbs were </p><p>badly cramped by it, and Hank Mar- </p><p>tin looked uncomfortable. </p><p> “Now for horses!” Ethan ex-</p><p>claimed. “These Luunians must have </p><p>left their mounts somewhere near by. </p><p>Scatter and search for them.” </p><p> In fact, a short search discovered a</p><p>dozen horses tethered near by in the </p><p>dusky shade of the giant toadstool for- </p><p>est. The steeds bore rude, high leather </p><p>saddles. And they reared and snorted </p><p>as the six comrades mounted. </p><p> “Now for Luun!” Ethan cried.</p><p>“Come on!” </p><p> He led the way as the little troop</p><p>galloped westward through the loom- </p><p>ing, grotesque toadstools. </p><p> The sun was setting ahead, casting a</p><p>broken red blaze through the forest </p><p>into their faces. The hooves of the </p><p>running horses made no sound on the </p><p>soft, moss-like turf.</p><p> The marvel of it for a moment took</p><p>Ethan’s mind. He and five comrades </p><p>ARMIES FROM THE PAST </p><p>67 </p><p>out of ages long before his own, riding </p><p>through this unearthly world of two </p><p>million years in the future! But his </p><p>sense of wonder faded as the desperate </p><p>urgency of their mission repossessed his </p><p>thoughts. </p><p> “It’s plain enough to a certain ex-</p><p>tent what happened,'’ he called as he </p><p>rode. “Kim Idim and Chiri came into </p><p>this time by means of his projector, and </p><p>built that litde house in the forest and </p><p>lived there alone. And then the Mas- </p><p>ters heard of their existence, and came </p><p>to capture them.” </p><p> “But it still ain’t plain to me,” re-</p><p>torted Hank Martin, “where them </p><p>Masters themselves came from.” </p><p>“From another world, that dying </p><p>warrior said,” Ethan reminded him. </p><p>And he nodded, momentarily thought- </p><p>ful, “They looked like creatures of an- </p><p>other planet, all right. Yet how did a </p><p>few of them conquer and enslave all </p><p>humans on Earth?” </p><p> They emerged suddenly, after only a</p><p>few minutes ride through the toadstool </p><p>forest, onto a great, empty grass plain. </p><p>Its rolling swales stretched to the dis- </p><p>tant horizon, upon which was poised </p><p>the enormous, dull-red orb of the set- </p><p>ting sun. </p><p> Reining their horses and gazing</p><p>ahead, they made out presently against </p><p>the glowing red shield of the sun-disk, </p><p>a far-distant cluster of black domes and </p><p>minarets. </p><p> “That's Luun!” exclaimed Ethan</p><p>eagerly. </p><p> Hank Martin’s keen eyes squinted.</p><p>“It’s plenty far away. It’ll be near </p><p>midnight, time we get there.” </p><p> As they spurred forward, the huge</p><p>red sun-shield sank rapidly from sight, </p><p>and the distant towers of Luun quickly </p><p>vanished in gathering shadows. </p><p> Stars pricked out in the darkening</p><p>sky, and looked down like curious</p><p>white eyes at the little company that </p><p>rode steadily on across the night- </p><p>shrouded plain. Into the sky slowly </p><p>wheeled strange constellations that </p><p>Ethan Drew could not recognize, new </p><p>star-patterns of this future time. </p><p> As he rode, he looked up at the</p><p>planets that shone with calm brightness </p><p>amid the twinkling stars. From which </p><p>of those planets had come those red- </p><p>skinned, hollow-eyed Masters who now </p><p>were rulers of old Earth? </p><p> To Ethan’s frantically anxious mind,</p><p>the ride across the plain beneath those </p><p>wheeling stars seemed endless. But at </p><p>last the black domes and towers of </p><p>Luun loomed large against the light- </p><p>gemmed heavens, a mile ahead. They </p><p>had been riding for some time through </p><p>cultivated fields and pastures. </p><p> “Slow down,” Ethan called tensely</p><p>to the others. “From now on, we’ve </p><p>got to act like an ordinary group of </p><p>Luunian soldiers, riding back into the </p><p>city after duty.” </p><p> “Me, I don’t cotton to cities,” mut-</p><p>tered Hank Martin, staring distrust- </p><p>fully at the black mass of structures. </p><p>“An’ how can we find Kim Idim an’ the </p><p>gal in thet big place?” </p><p> “Why, we’ll ask one of these</p><p>people,” declared Pedro Lopez. “And </p><p>if he won’t tell us, we’ll cut his throat </p><p>and ask another.” </p><p> “That is splendid strategy, Pedro,”</p><p>commented Ptah ironical^. “A man </p><p>who can think up such ruses as that </p><p>ought to be a general of armies.” </p><p>“Why, it is nothing-” Lopez be- </p><p>gan grandiloquently, and then as he </p><p>heard Ptah chuckling in the dark, he </p><p>exclaimed furiously, “Do you dare </p><p>make mock of me? I’ll show you that </p><p>Pedro Lopez, the veteran of a hundred </p><p>pitched battles and countless minor </p><p>skirmishes, is not to be—-—” </p><p> “Shut up, Pedro,” rasped Ethan.</p><p>68 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>“Do you want to let the whole city </p><p>know we’re coming?” </p><p> Lie continued tautly to the others,</p><p>“There must be a central prison of </p><p>some kind in this city, and that would </p><p>be where the Masters would put Kim </p><p>Idim and Chiri. We must find it.” </p><p>“An’ when we find this calabozo, </p><p>how’re we goin’ to git in it an’ git them </p><p>two out?” Hank Martin demanded. </p><p> “I have an idea as to that,” Ethan</p><p>told him. “It may or may not work, </p><p>but we’ll try it.” </p><p> “Aye,” boomed John Crewe unex-</p><p>pectedly. “Put your trust in God— </p><p>and strike hard. That was ever the </p><p>motto of my leader.” </p><p> “Keep that rifle out of sight, Hank,”</p><p>warned Ethan as they started forward. </p><p>“It would give you away. And you keep </p><p>your ax hidden too, Swain.” </p><p> Swain Njallson grunted. “I do not</p><p>like this creeping about by stealth,” the </p><p>Viking grumbled. “It is not my way to </p><p>slink into an enemy’s city in secret.” </p><p>Ethan’s heart thudded as they rode </p><p>into the city itself. The hooves of </p><p>their horses clattered on the worn stone </p><p>paving of winding streets that were </p><p>dark except for an occasional torch flar- </p><p>ing in a stone socket. Only a few people </p><p>were in the ill-lit streets, all of them </p><p>white slaves and soldiers, and these </p><p>only glanced at the little passing troop. </p><p> The barbaric appearance of the city</p><p>Luun, the complete lack of artificial </p><p>light or any other evidences of indus- </p><p>trial civilization, puzzled Ethan. If the </p><p>red Masters had really once come from </p><p>another world, that implied scientific </p><p>knowledge which accorded ill with their </p><p>present archaic form of life. Even in </p><p>the fight back in the forest, he had no- </p><p>ticed that they possessed no other </p><p>weapons than swords and spears. </p><p> As they rode on in a compact band</p><p>through the dark and winding ways of </p><p>Luun, a vast black bulk took form </p><p>ahead. It was a monstrous fortress in </p><p>the form of a terraced cube, a brutal </p><p>pile that rose like a mountain of ma* </p><p>sonry. By the torchlight that spilled </p><p>from its myriad windows, they saw that </p><p>its massive entrances were guarded by </p><p>solid ranks of Luunian warriors. </p><p> “That fortress may be where they</p><p>have Chiri and Kim Idim!” Ethan ex- </p><p>claimed as he and his comrades reined </p><p>up and stared ahead through the dark- </p><p>ness. </p><p> “If so, we can’t hope to save them,”</p><p>muttered Ptah. “It would take a great </p><p>army to force that place.” </p><p> “I don’t think Kim Idim an’ the gal</p><p>are in there,” said Hank Martin keenly. </p><p>He pointed to a smaller structure be- </p><p>yond the great fortress, a low, oblong </p><p>black building. “Thet looks more like </p><p>the calabozo to me—see the barred </p><p>winders?” </p><p> Ethan perceived that the trapper</p><p>was right. The windows of the oblong </p><p>building were heavily barred. </p><p> “Yes, that must be the prison of</p><p>Luun!” he exclaimed with renewed </p><p>hope. </p><p> Lie turned in the saddle. “I’m going</p><p>there, and I want you with me, Ptah. </p><p>The rest of you will wait here.” </p><p> “How in hell’s name do you expect</p><p>to accomplish anything with only two </p><p>swords?” Pedro Lopez exclaimed an- </p><p>grily. “We’ll all go.” </p><p> “No!” Ethan ordered. “If we get</p><p>Kim Idim and Chiri out at all, it will be </p><p>by trickery. And more than one man </p><p>accompanying me would arouse sus- </p><p>picion and ruin my plan.” </p><p> Though the conquistador muttered</p><p>complainingly, he remained with the </p><p>others in the dark street wThile Ethan </p><p>and Ptah rode on toward the prison, </p><p>across the plaza in front of the fortress. </p><p>ARMIES FROM THE PAST </p><p>69 </p><p>As they circled to avoid passing too </p><p>close to the mountainous cubical for- </p><p>tress, Ethan glimpsed groups of the red </p><p>Masters inside its myriad torchlit cham- </p><p>bers. </p><p> “All the Masters of Luun must dwell</p><p>in that fortress," muttered Ptah. “We </p><p>have seen none of them elsewhere in </p><p>the city, and no other place here is so </p><p>heavily guarded.” </p><p> Ethan nodded. He told the little</p><p>Egyptian tautlv, “Let me do the talk- </p><p>ing when we enter the prison.” </p><p>Tn a few minutes they rode up to the </p><p>entrance of the low, oblong prison. </p><p>It was a great archway closed by barred </p><p>metal gates. Inside the bars, in a torch- </p><p>lit anteroom, four of the white Luunian </p><p>guards were stationed. </p><p> “A message from the Masters!”</p><p>Ethan called peremptorily in their </p><p>tongue. “Summon your officer.” </p><p> He hoped fervently that they would</p><p>not notice the different accent and </p><p>stumbling way in which he used their </p><p>language. If that gave him away, all </p><p>was lost. </p><p> But the warriors inside seemed to no-</p><p>tice nothing. One ran to call their offi- </p><p>cer, while the others opened the barred </p><p>gates for Ethan and Ptah to enter. The </p><p>American and Egyptian did so, dis- </p><p>mounting inside the gates as they swung </p><p>shut again. </p><p> The officer of the Luunian guards</p><p>appeared, rubbing his eyes sleepily and </p><p>adjusting his metal helmet. </p><p> “What word from the Masters?”</p><p>he asked respectfully. </p><p> “Our sacred rulers have sent me to</p><p>fetch to them the old man and the girl </p><p>captured today in the forest,” Ethan </p><p>stated sharply. “The Masters would </p><p>question them.” </p><p> “But the girl is not here—only the</p><p>old man is here!” protested the Luun- </p><p>ian captain. “Surely the Masters know </p><p>that?” </p><p> Ethan’s heart sank like lead. The</p><p>Luunian was staring at him perplexedly, </p><p>and he rallied himself. </p><p> “Of course they know that!” he</p><p>snapped. “I did not say I had come for </p><p>the old man and girl—I said I was here </p><p>to fetch the old man who was captured </p><p>with the girl.” </p><p> “Your pardon—I understood you</p><p>wrongly,” the Luunian replied. “I will </p><p>take you to him.” </p><p> Ethan and Ptah followed him along</p><p>torchlit corridors of stone, gloomy, </p><p>chill passageways that breathed the </p><p>mustiness of ages. Then the Luunian </p><p>captain stopped and unlocked a door </p><p>with a clumsy metal key. </p><p> “Your man is inside,” he told Ethan.</p><p>It seemed to Ethan that the officer </p><p>was staring at him too sharply, with </p><p>too much sudden interest. </p><p> “Very well, you may return to your</p><p>couch,” Ethan said with assumed </p><p>friendliness. *“We will take the pris- </p><p>oner to the Masters.” </p><p> The officer left them, returning</p><p>along the stone corridors. And at once </p><p>Ethan and Ptah sprang into the dark </p><p>stone cell. Thin hands clutched Ethan’s </p><p>arm from the darkness. </p><p> “I recognized your voice!” gasped</p><p>Kim Idim. “You are mad to take this </p><p>chance!” </p><p> “Where’s Chiri?” Ethan exclaimed</p><p>tensely. “If she's not in this building, </p><p>where are they keeping her?” </p><p> “She is in the dungeons of the for-</p><p>tress of the Masters,” Kim Idim an- </p><p>swered, his voice agonized. “Yes, be- </p><p>cause she is young and beautiful, the </p><p>Masters have sentenced her -to take </p><p>part in the monthly Feast of Life, to- </p><p>morrow noon.” </p><p> “The Feast of Life—what is that?”</p><p>demanded Ptah. </p><p>70 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> “I do not know exactly, but it is some</p><p>horrible rite which the Masters prac- </p><p>tise each month on certain selected hu- </p><p>man victims, who are never seen alive </p><p>again,” Kim Idim answered, his tone </p><p>heavy with dread. </p><p> “Osiris save the maiden—for we</p><p>cannot!” Ptah exclaimed in horror. “It </p><p>would require thousands of men to </p><p>force an entrance into that guarded </p><p>fortress. Nor could we enter there by </p><p>trickery, as we have done here.” </p><p> “But we’ve got to get Chiri out of</p><p>there somehow!” Ethan exclaimed </p><p>hoarsely. He asked desperately, “Kim </p><p>Idim, couldn’t we stir up these Luunians </p><p>to revolt against the Masters, and </p><p>storm the fortress?” </p><p> “No, no!” Kim Idim declared. “The</p><p>Luunians would never revolt against </p><p>their rulers, for all the people of this </p><p>city are drugged into hypnotized sub- </p><p>mission to the Masters.” </p><p> “Drugged?” cried the Egyptian.</p><p>“Yes, I have discovered it since I </p><p>have been prisoned here,” the old </p><p>scientist told them rapidly. “When the </p><p>Masters came to earth from another </p><p>world long ago, they conquered and en- </p><p>slaved humanity by secretly poisoning </p><p>all water supplies with an hypnotic </p><p>drug, which subtly changed their brains </p><p>so that they fell into a state of perpet- </p><p>ual awe of and submission to the Mas- </p><p>ters. </p><p> “That was millenniums ago. Since</p><p>then the Masters, undisputed rulers of </p><p>the earth, have become decadent and </p><p>lost almost all their former scientific </p><p>powers, but they still continue to drug </p><p>the people of their cities, and those </p><p>people will never rebel until they cease </p><p>to be so drugged. Indeed, these Luun- </p><p>ians would fight to the death to protect </p><p>the Masters.” </p><p> “Then I. was right—there is no hope</p><p>for the girl,” Ptah exclaimed. “For if </p><p>there are no men left on Earth except</p><p>the drugged slaves of the Masters, </p><p>where shall we get the army that would </p><p>be needed to storm that fortress?” </p><p> “I can get that army—yes, and a</p><p>mighty one!” Kim Idim declared excit- </p><p>edly. “I can do it, if I can get back to </p><p>my house in the forest where is the </p><p>time-ray projector.” </p><p> Ethan, even in his agonized appre-</p><p>hension for Chiri, was stupefied by the </p><p>implication. </p><p> “Good God, Kim Idim, you don’t</p><p>mean you’d get an army from-” </p><p> “From the past, yes!” Kim Idim ex-</p><p>claimed. “With the projector, I can </p><p>draw thousands of men at a time out of </p><p>dead ages, as easily as I drew you six. </p><p>Out of die past I can draw whole great </p><p>armies, and we can lead them back here </p><p>to Luun, attack the city and the for- </p><p>tress, rescue Chiri and destroy the Mas- </p><p>ters’ rule for ever.” </p><p> For a space of moments, Ethan and</p><p>Ptah stared aghast at the old scien- </p><p>tist, petrified by the incredible audacity </p><p>of the plan he had proposed. </p><p> To draw great armies of fighting-</p><p>men out of the past! To raise the hosts </p><p>of the past against the drugged, en- </p><p>slaved people of the future! </p><p> “By the claws of Bast, it is a great</p><p>plan!” cried Ptah excitedly. “And it is </p><p>the only one by which we can hope to </p><p>save the maiden.” </p><p> “It might be done,” muttered Ethan,</p><p>his thoughts racing, “But. it will take </p><p>hours to get Kim Idim back to his pro- </p><p>jector, to draw those armies from the </p><p>past and get diem moving toward dii.s </p><p>city. And at noon tomorrow, you said, </p><p>Chiri is to meet some hideous fate.” </p><p>Ethan’s jaw clamped in sudden deci- </p><p>sion. “Ptah, you and the other hoys </p><p>will ride back with Kim Idim to the </p><p>projector, and help him put his plan </p><p>into effect” </p><p>ARMIES FROM THE PAST </p><p>71 </p><p> “And you?” cried the Egyptian wor-</p><p>riedly. </p><p> “I’m staying here in Luun,” Ethan</p><p>clipped. “I won’t leave Chiri here— </p><p>for if this wild plan of Kim Idim’s </p><p>should take too long, we'd be too late </p><p>to save her from the Feast of Life. I’ll </p><p>stay and try to get her out of the for- </p><p>tress, and if I fail, you may still be in </p><p>time. At least, you can avenge us.” </p><p> “No, Ethan, your resolve is mad!”</p><p>cried Kim Idim. “I tell you, that for- </p><p>tress is so guarded by companies of </p><p>Luunian warriors that not even a rat </p><p>could enter it unchallenged. You will </p><p>be merely throwing your life away." </p><p> “Nevertheless, I’m going to try it,”</p><p>Edian returned grimly. ‘‘Come on, </p><p>Ptah—we’ve got to get out of here so </p><p>you can get out of the city with Kim </p><p>Idim.” </p><p>HHhey hastened out of the cell, and </p><p>“*■ along the dusky stone corridors. </p><p>The old scientist walked between the </p><p>other two like a prisoner escorted by </p><p>guards. </p><p> Ethan tensed as they neared the</p><p>anteroom within the entrance. Sud- </p><p>denly the little Egyptian halted. </p><p> “Listen!” he hissed.</p><p> They heard the rapid, obsequious</p><p>voice of the Luunian captain of guards </p><p>who had led them through the prison. </p><p> “I suspected at once that the man</p><p>was an impostor and not a messenger </p><p>from you, Highness,” the Luunian was </p><p>saying. “He did not know that the girl </p><p>is not here, and he spoke our tongue </p><p>awry and did not even look like a man </p><p>of Luun.” </p><p> “We delayed too long I” Ptah hissed.</p><p> The Egyptian’s sword flashed out,</p><p>and at the same moment Ethan Drew’s </p><p>blade rasped from its sheath. </p><p> “Keep behind us, Kim Idim,” or-</p><p>dered Ethan. “Come on, Ptah.” </p><p> They pushed on and emerged</p><p>abruptly into the big stone anteroom </p><p>just inside the barred prison gates. </p><p> The Luunian captain and the four</p><p>gate-guards were there. And beside the </p><p>officer was a red-skinned, hairless cari- </p><p>cature of humanity—one of the spindle- </p><p>limbed Masters. </p><p> “There are the impostors!” cried</p><p>the Luunian officer loudly as the three </p><p>emerged. </p><p> The Master's hollow eyes flashed in-</p><p>stantly with alarm. </p><p> “It is two of the strangers who slew</p><p>our men in the forest today!” the red </p><p>creature cried in a shrill, high voice. </p><p>“Kill them!” </p><p> But already Edian and Ptah were</p><p>rushing forward. The Luunian cap- </p><p>tain and one of his men died as they </p><p>were tugging out their swords, smitten </p><p>by blades like lightning-bolts. </p><p> “Guards!” the Master screamed in</p><p>his unhumanly shrill tones, scrambling </p><p>fearfully to one side. </p><p> “Open that gate, Ptah!” yelled</p><p>Ethan. “I’ll hold these off!” </p><p> As he shouted, Ethan’s sword swung</p><p>in a terrific slicing sweep toward the </p><p>unhuman red creature who was shout- </p><p>ing the alarm. The head of the Mas- </p><p>ter leaped from his shoulders, and black </p><p>blood spurted from his decapitated </p><p>trunk as it crumpled. </p><p> The three remaining Luunian guards</p><p>were momentarily transfixed with hor- </p><p>ror as they beheld the death of one of </p><p>the rulers their drugged minds revered. </p><p> “Lie has slain one of the sacred</p><p>ones!” shrieked one of the Luunians. </p><p>“Kill him!” </p><p> The three rushed toward Ethan with</p><p>swords out, wild rage on their con- </p><p>torted faces.</p><p> Ptah was fumbling frantically with</p><p>the catches of the barred gates. And a </p><p>distant rush of feet was audible as more </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>guards cams running from elsewhere </p><p>in the prison building. </p><p> Kim Idim thrust a foot and tripped</p><p>one of the three charging Luunians. As </p><p>his companions stumbled over him, </p><p>Ethan stabbed fiercely at them, then </p><p>slashed downward. It was a brief ex- </p><p>plosion of steel and motion, at the end </p><p>of which the man who had tripped and </p><p>one of the others lay dead, while the </p><p>third reeled back with his shoulder </p><p>torn. </p><p>“Guards! This way!” he screamed. </p><p>“The gates are open!” yelled Ptah. </p><p> Ethan grabbed Kim Idim’s arm and</p><p>ran with the old scientist and the Egyp- </p><p>tian out of the torchlit prison into the </p><p>darkness. They heard a roar of rage </p><p>behind them, as a dozen Luunian war- </p><p>riors poured after them. Ethan raised </p><p>his voice in a wild shout. </p><p>“Swain! Hank! This way!” </p><p> Through the dark stretts answered</p><p>Hank Martin’s voice in a ringing yell. </p><p>There was a rush of clattering hoofs, </p><p>and out of the darkness rode the trap- </p><p>per and Lopez, Swain and Crewe. </p><p> “Where’s the gal?” yelled Hank</p><p>Martin. </p><p> “We can’t reach her—-we can only</p><p>save her if we get Kim Idim back to </p><p>his machine!” cried Ptah. </p><p> “Look out!” bellowed Lopez. “Here</p><p>they come!” </p><p> The Luunian guards, mad with rage,</p><p>were flinging themselves forward with </p><p>insane ferocity. </p><p>“Kill the blasphemers who slew a </p><p>Master!” their leader was shrieking. </p><p> Ethan whirled, as the Luunians</p><p>charged. A blade tore his forearm open </p><p>and another grazed his thigh as he </p><p>struck in desperate defense. </p><p> Ptah was fighting beside him, and</p><p>now the four mounted men spurred </p><p>their plunging steeds amid the Luun- </p><p>ians. Broadsword and saber, battle-ax </p><p>and clubbed rifle, smashed down on the </p><p>raging warriors. But the crazy, scram- </p><p>bling fight in the dark street went on. </p><p>Ethan heard a rising uproar all dirough </p><p>the surrounding streets. A great bell </p><p>somewhere in the huge fortress had be- </p><p>gun to clang in alarm. </p><p> John Crewe, his face flaming crim-</p><p>son, dropped from his horse beside the </p><p>staggering Kim Idim. He thrust the old </p><p>man up into his saddle and yelled </p><p>hoarsely to Ethan. </p><p> “Ride for it! I’ll hold back these</p><p>godless ones!” </p><p> “No, we won’t leave you here!”</p><p>Ethan cried. </p><p> But as he shouted, a sword rang off</p><p>Crewe’s helmet, and the big Puritan </p><p>sank to the ground, stunned. </p><p>Ethan and Ptah had gained the </p><p>backs of their horses. The Amer- </p><p>ican tried to spur forward to where </p><p>John Crewe lay, but the maddened </p><p>Luunians prevented him. </p><p> “If we don't git movin’, we’ll all</p><p>leave our scalps here!” yelled Hank </p><p>Martin urgendy. </p><p> “You can’t hope to save either Chiri</p><p>or Crewe now!’’ Ptah shouted to </p><p>Ethan. “Ride, or our only chance to </p><p>rescue them later will be lost!” </p><p> Ethan realized that the Egyptian</p><p>spoke truth. Luunian warriors were </p><p>coming on the run from all directions, </p><p>and the whole city seemed waking to </p><p>the alarm. </p><p> “Out of Luun, then!” he cried.</p><p> They dug spurs into their horses</p><p>and dashed through the dark streets, </p><p>alive with emerging warriors. </p><p> Leaning over their horses’ necks,</p><p>Ethan and his comrades slashed</p><p>fiercely at the startled Luunians who </p><p>sought to halt them. The hooves of </p><p>their mounts waked a thunder of echoes </p><p>in the dark, narrow stone streets. </p><p>ARMIES FROM THE PAST </p><p>73 </p><p> Behind them, the alarm bell in the</p><p>fortress of the Masters was still clang- </p><p>ing wildly, and torches were bobbing </p><p>like swirling fireflies. But in a few mo- </p><p>ments they were out of the great city, </p><p>galloping through the darkness over </p><p>the surrounding farmlands and then </p><p>over the grassy plain. </p><p> “Eastward!” Kim Idim shouted</p><p>thinly over the rush of wind. “We go </p><p>too much to the north!” </p><p> Ethan reined his pounding steed to</p><p>the right, and the others followed. </p><p>Glancing back, he saw the vast black </p><p>mass of Luun alive with torches, rap- </p><p>idly receding behind them. </p><p> Bitter rage and disappointment</p><p>throbbed in his heart, and fear—fear </p><p>for Chiri and for his Puritan comrade. </p><p> “It’s the first time ever I left a fel-</p><p>low soldier in the lurch!” Pedro Lopez </p><p>was raging as he rode. “Name of God, </p><p>why did we run away and leave him </p><p>there to be killed?” </p><p> “Your comrade was only stunned—</p><p>and he will not be killed, at least until </p><p>tomorrow noon,” Kim Idim called. </p><p>“He will undoubtedly be sentenced to </p><p>the Feast of Life, like my Chiri. And </p><p>we shall return to Luun, before the </p><p>Feast takes place, if my plan succeeds.” </p><p>“What is this Feast?” demanded the </p><p>enraged Spaniard. “And what is this </p><p>plan?” </p><p> Ethan shouted a brief plan to them,</p><p>and he heard their exclamations of be- </p><p>wilderment. </p><p> “Holy smoke, whole armies from</p><p>the past?” gasped Hank Martin. </p><p>“Why, the scheme is plumb loco!” </p><p> “I can do it!” Kim Idim cried. “By</p><p>simply expanding the field of the time- </p><p>ray, I can draw an army through time </p><p>as easily as one man.” </p><p> “The plan is good!” cried Pedro</p><p>Lopez exultantly. “Dios, we’ll show</p><p>these soft ones of the future how men </p><p>of the past could fight! We’ll tear </p><p>their cursed city wide open.” </p><p> “Aye,” rumbled Swain harshly. “By</p><p>Thor, it will be something to fight </p><p>shoulder to shoulder with the great </p><p>warriors of past ages.” </p><p> “But I can’t figger,” called Hank</p><p>Martin, to the old scientist, “why you </p><p>don’t jest use thet machine of yours to </p><p>yank Chiri and Crewe themselves out </p><p>of the city.” </p><p> “That is impossible,” Kim Idim</p><p>cried to him. “The time-ray can only </p><p>operate spatially when it is being simul- </p><p>taneously projected along the time-di- </p><p>mension.” </p><p> As they rode, Ethan had been clum-</p><p>sily binding an improvised bandage </p><p>around his wounded forearm. The </p><p>lights of Luun had disappeared behind </p><p>them some time before, but Ptah turned </p><p>in his saddle and looked anxiously </p><p>back across the starlit plain. </p><p> “They’ll follow us,” the little Egyp-</p><p>tian called tautly. “And they’ll guess </p><p>we’re heading for the forest.” </p><p> “Ha, let them follow!” cried Pedro</p><p>Lopez scornfully. “We’ll make mince- </p><p>meat of those who are unlucky enough </p><p>to overtake us.” </p><p> “We must hurry,” urged Ethan,</p><p>agonized with apprehension. “Unless </p><p>we re-enter Luun with our forces by </p><p>noon, we’ll be too late.” </p><p> Rushing hoofs drummed the dark</p><p>plain as mile after mile dropped behind </p><p>them. In the vague, thin starlight, they </p><p>could not discern how close pursuit </p><p>might be behind them. </p><p>TTours that seemed eternities to </p><p>Ethan had passed by the time they </p><p>glimpsed ahead of them the dark wall </p><p>of the grotesque toadstool forest. </p><p>Without slackening speed, they rode </p><p>into the deep shadow of the towering </p><p>growths. </p><p>14 </p><p>'WEIRD TALES </p><p> Quickly they came to the little clear-</p><p>ing in the forest where Kim Idim’s </p><p>metal house glinted vaguely. They </p><p>pitched hastily from the saddles of the </p><p>panting horses. </p><p> “It is nearly morning!” Kim Idim</p><p>declared. “And we must carry the pro- </p><p>jector out onto the plain—there is not </p><p>room in this forest for the hosts I shall </p><p>draw from the past.” </p><p> “First I’m gittin’ back into decent</p><p>clothes,” muttered Hank Martin. I feel </p><p>naked in this durned armor.” </p><p> Lie and Lopez and the Viking</p><p>scrambled back into their proper cloth- </p><p>ing, and then followed Ethan and Ptah </p><p>and the old scientist into the little </p><p>house. With Kim Idim directing, the </p><p>five comrades bent and lifted the mas- </p><p>sive time-ray projector. </p><p> The mechanism was appallingly</p><p>heavy. Without the great strength of </p><p>Swain, they could not 'have carried it. </p><p>Straining every muscle, they bore the </p><p>thing out of the house and through the </p><p>forest. Kim Idim followed with the </p><p>horses. </p><p> Dawn was paling the heavens as they</p><p>emerged onto the great plain. At the </p><p>old scientist’s direction, they carried the </p><p>projector to the summit of a small bare </p><p>hillock. There they set it down. </p><p> “Look!” cried Ptah suddenly, point-</p><p>ing westward across the plain, “The </p><p>Luunians come!” </p><p> Two miles away, a dark mass was</p><p>approaching. </p><p> “A big bunoh of mounted warriors,”</p><p>muttered Hank Martin. “We can’t </p><p>hold oft a crowd like that, out here in </p><p>the open.” </p><p> “Flurry, Kim Idim!” Ethan ex-</p><p>claimed tautly. “It’s now or never for </p><p>your scheme.” </p><p> Kim Idim was already working with</p><p>frantic speed, twisting the amazingly </p><p>intricate controls of his great creation, </p><p>setting the dials that directed the time- </p><p>ray along the mysterious time-dimen- </p><p>sion and in space. The old scientist </p><p>peered tensely, as he worked, into the </p><p>glass screen in the projector’s face. </p><p> A picture, a living picture, suddenly</p><p>appeared in the screen, a vista of a </p><p>green coast and a blue sea, with a small </p><p>city of marble and brick buildings on </p><p>the shore; dignified men in togas, slaves </p><p>in leather tunics, a few soldiers in </p><p>crested helmet and armor, walked in </p><p>its cobbled streets. In the screen, they </p><p>saw this living scene as though from </p><p>high above. </p><p> “That’s a city of the Roman em-</p><p>pire !” Ethan cried. “But there are only </p><p>a few fighting-men there.” </p><p> “I shall have to find their warriors,”</p><p>Kim Idim panted. Lie slowly turned a </p><p>knob. </p><p> The stylus touching the world-globe</p><p>atop the projector moved imperceptibly </p><p>in answer. The scene in the glass screen </p><p>shifted swiftly, over the countryside of </p><p>that imperial Roman province of more </p><p>than two million years before. </p><p> “The Luunians are near!” warned</p><p>Lopez, and Ethan heard the rasp of </p><p>the Spaniard’s sword as he drew. </p><p> “Looks like we’re due for a scrap,”</p><p>Hank Martin drawled in agreement, </p><p>calmly reloading his long rifle. </p><p> Ethan saw that the Luunians num-</p><p>bered about two hundred mounted men, </p><p>led by a half-dozen of the red Masters. </p><p>They were now less than a mile away, </p><p>riding steadily forward. </p><p> “I have it!” Kim Idim cried ex-</p><p>citedly. </p><p> Ethan spun back to the projector.</p><p>In the screen, he looked down on a </p><p>stone road, and a marching body of </p><p>some four thousand armored men, </p><p>winding like a great metal snake along </p><p>that Roman highway of long ago.</p><p> “A Roman legion on the march!”</p><p>ARMIES FROM THE PAST </p><p>75 </p><p>Ethan cried. “Can you draw them all </p><p>through, Kim Idim?” </p><p> “I think so,” panted the old man,</p><p>his forehead damp, his hands trembling </p><p>as he touched the knobs. </p><p> A fierce, wolfish yell from scores of</p><p>throats crashed on Ethan’s ears. The </p><p>advancing body of Luunians had seen </p><p>their quarry on the hillock. They came </p><p>on in a gallop. </p><p> “Dios, they’ll ride right up over us!”</p><p>yelled Pedro Lopez. “They’ll-” </p><p> “Look!” screamed Ptah. “In the</p><p>name of Osiris, look!” </p><p> Kim Idim had, a moment before,</p><p>shut a switch. And instantly, the incred- </p><p>ible had taken place. </p><p> A Roman legion of four thousand</p><p>men had suddenly materialized out </p><p>there on the empty plain. </p><p> For a moment, Ethan and his com-</p><p>rades were as stupefied as the Luunians </p><p>who had stopped in their charge and </p><p>were staring petrifiedly at the suddenly- </p><p>materialized legion. </p><p> “You’ve done it, Kim Idim!” Ethan</p><p>shouted hoarsely. </p><p> “Others—other armies of the dead</p><p>ages," Kim Idim was panting as he </p><p>reset his controls. “I'll get them-” </p><p> The Roman soldiers out on the plain</p><p>for a long minute stared about them, </p><p>utterly bewildered by their sudden swift </p><p>transition from their own world into </p><p>this, to them, alien one. A babel of </p><p>cries arose from the legionnaries. </p><p> But the confusion of the Romans</p><p>lasted only briefly. Their officers had </p><p>glimpsed the mounted Luunians near </p><p>by. And Ethan and his companions </p><p>heard the officers bark rapid orders in </p><p>staccato Latin.</p><p>rpHE Romans responded quickly. The </p><p>long column in which they had been </p><p>formed changed shape smoothly and </p><p>swiftly, its maniples shifting like cogs </p><p>of a machine, the knights or mounted </p><p>men moving out in a screen toward the </p><p>Luunians, the solid mass of footmen </p><p>forming up into three divisins facing </p><p>their potential enemy. </p><p> “Sangre de Cristo, that’s discipline!”</p><p>shouted Pedro Lopez. </p><p> “Keep at it, Kim Idim!” cried Hank</p><p>Martin, hopping in excitement. “We’ll </p><p>need plenty more men.” </p><p> The switch of the projector clicked</p><p>shut again. A second body of men ap- </p><p>peared like magic on the plain, some </p><p>distance beyond the Roman legion. </p><p> These were a thousand unmounted</p><p>men. black-bearded soldiers in peaked </p><p>metal caps and kirtle-like skirts, bear- </p><p>ing tall shields and long, heavy spears. </p><p>Stunned for a moment, these new- </p><p>comers began milling about in wild con- </p><p>fusion. </p><p> “Assyrian spearmen!” yelled Ptah.</p><p>“I’ve fought with those devils, more </p><p>than once.” </p><p> “Haw! Haw! Look at them Luun-</p><p>ians pullin' out!'’ exulted the trapper. </p><p> The two hundred Luunian horsemen,</p><p>petrified by the appearance of the </p><p>Roman legion, had come to life with </p><p>cries of terror as the Assyrian spear- </p><p>men materialized. They had wheeled, </p><p>were riding in a wild gallop back to- </p><p>ward their city. </p><p> Kim Idim, trembling as though ap-</p><p>palled by the supernatural audacity of </p><p>what he was doing, was working like </p><p>a madman with the projector controls. </p><p>Every few minutes he slammed the </p><p>switch shut—and each time, Ethan and </p><p>his comrades saw a new host material- </p><p>ize suddenly on the plain. </p><p> A band of Spartan warriors, stocky</p><p>men in heavy armor who looked stu-</p><p>pidly but fearlessly about them, had </p><p>appeared after the Assyrians. And </p><p>close after them came into being a force </p><p>of a few hundred huge blond men in </p><p>76 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>horned helmets, Ninth Century North- </p><p>men at sight of whom Swain Njallson </p><p>shouted loudly! </p><p> A troop of three hundred mail-clad,</p><p>mounted Crusaders; a host of white- </p><p>robed Arab horsemen out of the armies </p><p>of Abu Bekr; and a full eight hundred </p><p>of Genghis Khan’s Mongol riders, </p><p>wiry, swarthy little men on shaggy </p><p>ponies—these three forces appeared </p><p>swiftly after one another. </p><p> Yet still Kim Idim reached back into</p><p>the past with the potent band of the </p><p>time-ray, first for a regiment of Napo- </p><p>leon’s infantry, tall men in cocked hats </p><p>and blue and white uniforms, bayonets </p><p>glinting in the sun; and then for a band </p><p>of several hundred mounted Indian </p><p>braves, copper-skinned savages in bril- </p><p>liant feathers and war paint. </p><p> “That’s a Sioux war party!” cried</p><p>Hank Martin excitedly as this last </p><p>force materialized on the plain. </p><p> . “Can you talk their language,</p><p>Hank?” Ethan asked tensely, and the </p><p>trapper nodded. </p><p> “Sure can, seein’ as how I was a</p><p>prisoner in one of their villages a hull </p><p>winter.” </p><p> “But look!” cried Ptah in consterna-</p><p>tion. “The armies attack each other!” </p><p> Ethan cried out in dismay. Out on</p><p>the plain, the hosts from the past were </p><p>wheeling to give battle. Romans, As- </p><p>syrians and Spartans, Northmen, Cru- </p><p>saders and Arabs, Mongols and French </p><p>and Sioux—all of them, at first stunned </p><p>by their sudden transition to this new </p><p>scene, now seemed to hold the others </p><p>responsible for the phenomenon. </p><p> The buccinas, or great curved trump-</p><p>ets of the Romans, were bellowing </p><p>hoarsely and the legion was moving </p><p>like a ponderous, irresistible machine </p><p>toward the Assyrians, who with wolf- </p><p>like batde cries were marching to meet </p><p>the Romans. The Spartans stood their</p><p>ground like a rock, ready for any at- </p><p>tacker, but Crusaders and Arabs, see- </p><p>ing in each other well-known foes, were </p><p>riding full tilt toward each other. The </p><p>French regiment still stood bewildered, </p><p>but the Vikings were on the march </p><p>toward it, their axes gleaming wickedly. </p><p>And, far out on the plain, Mongols </p><p>and red Sioux were circling. </p><p> “We’ve got to stop diem from fight-</p><p>ing each other!” Ethan cried desper- </p><p>ately. “We’ll never separate them once </p><p>they get tangled in battle.” </p><p> “Flank, fire your rifle into the air,”</p><p>he ordered urgently. </p><p> The trapper obeyed instantly. And</p><p>the ringing report of the rifle brought </p><p>the eyes of all the thousands out on the </p><p>plain toward the hillock. </p><p> Ethan cupped his hands and shouted</p><p>to them with all the force of his lungs, </p><p>first in French and Arabic, then in </p><p>stumbling, half-forgotten Latin and </p><p>Greek. </p><p> “Do not attack each other!” he</p><p>yelled to the dazed hosts. “It is we who </p><p>have brought you into this world. Send </p><p>your leaders here to us, and we will </p><p>explain!” </p><p> Hank Martin and Swain repeated</p><p>his cry, the first in the harsh Sioux </p><p>tongue and the second in his native </p><p>Northland language. And Ptah added </p><p>his version for the Assyrians. </p><p> “They understood!” Pedro Lopez</p><p>cried. “See, the leaders come.” </p><p> “Thank heaven!” Ethan muttered.</p><p>“Even the Mongols must have under- </p><p>stood my Arabic—they’re all coming.” </p><p>From every one of the armies out on </p><p>the plain, a single man was approaching </p><p>the hillock. An unspoken truce had </p><p>been declared between the hosts. </p><p>Sheepskin-clad Mongol chieftain, </p><p>Roman commander, French colonel </p><p>and mailed Crusader leader—these </p><p>ARMIES FROM THE PAST </p><p>7.7 </p><p>rode up onto the hillock first. An Arab </p><p>emir and a Sioux war-chief in full </p><p>regalia followed. And last, on foot, </p><p>tramped a stalwart Northman, a heavy- </p><p>faced Spartan officer, and a cruel-eyed, </p><p>black-bearded Assyrian captain. </p><p> “What manner of men are you and</p><p>how dare you work your magic upon a </p><p>Roman legion?” demanded the Roman </p><p>commander in hard, dipped Latin. </p><p> “What world is this?” the French</p><p>colonel was exclaiming bewilderedly. </p><p>“Dieu, but a few minutes ago my regi- </p><p>ment was marching through Saxony, </p><p>and now--” </p><p> And a babble of voices in different</p><p>tongues broke loose upon Ethan. Only </p><p>the Mongols and Spartans and Sioux </p><p>waited, grimly silent. </p><p> “You have been drawn far into the</p><p>ages to be,” Ethan answered, raising </p><p>his voice and repeating each sentence </p><p>in the different tongues he had used. </p><p>“Not magic, but the skill of yon old </p><p>man has snatched you from your own </p><p>times. And we have brought you into </p><p>this far age, to fight! </p><p> “Yes, we desire you to follow us to</p><p>the attack of a might}’ city which lies </p><p>but a few hours’ march from here. It </p><p>is a city in which demonic tyrants op- </p><p>press men of Earth. Only by destroying </p><p>those tyrants can bewitched people who </p><p>serve them and fight for them be freed </p><p>from bondage.” </p><p> “And if we refuse?” demanded the</p><p>mailed Crusader harshly. </p><p> “Then we shall refuse to send you</p><p>back to your own ages!” Ethan told </p><p>them all. “But if you follow us to this </p><p>battle and conquer, after it is over we </p><p>will return you once more to your own </p><p>times and lands.” </p><p> There followed a taut silence, after</p><p>Ptah and Swain and the trapper had </p><p>repeated Ethan’s proposal in the</p><p>tongues spoken by the others. </p><p> “I agree, for my legion,” the Roman</p><p>commander said finally, breaking the </p><p>silence. “For it seems that only by so </p><p>doing can we win back to our own </p><p>land.” </p><p> “Though it goes ill for us to fight</p><p>side by side with iniidels,” declared the </p><p>Arab emir finally, “we shall do so in </p><p>this case.” </p><p> The Mongol captain had a con-</p><p>temptuous sneer on his swart, flat face </p><p>as he told Ethan in stumbling Arabic: </p><p>“We men of the great Khan are more </p><p>accustomed to killing Moslems than to </p><p>fighting as their allies. But we agree </p><p>also.” </p><p> The others, one by one, also agreed,</p><p>some slowly, others, like the Northmen, </p><p>fired by prospect of battle. . </p><p> Ethan turned finally to Hank Mar-</p><p>tin, who had been exchanging harsh </p><p>syllables with the Sioux war-chief. </p><p> “What about those Indians?” he</p><p>asked. </p><p> The trapper grinned. “This chief</p><p>says it’s plain that we’ve got great med- </p><p>icine, an’ he an’ his braves will follow </p><p>us anywhere, so long as thar’s scalps </p><p>to be taken.” </p><p> “Go back and get your men ready to</p><p>march at once,” Ethan told the assem- </p><p>bled captains. And he briefly indicated </p><p>the plan of formation he desired. </p><p> As the leaders hurried back to their</p><p>respective forces, Kim Idim clutched </p><p>Ethan’s arm. </p><p> “Ethan, the sun is already high ! We</p><p>must hasten, if we are to reach Luun </p><p>before noon—before the mysterious </p><p>Feast of Life.” </p><p> Ethan’s heart sank as he perceived</p><p>how far the sun had climbed into the </p><p>heavens. </p><p> “We’ve lost too much time,” he said,</p><p>his voice raw with anxiety. “Come on !”</p><p>. He and the four comrades and the </p><p>old scientist mounted quickly. And they </p><p>78 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>galloped together down from the hil- </p><p>lock and between the armies that were </p><p>forming up to march. </p><p> The solid mass of the Roman legion</p><p>lay in the center of the great host, with </p><p>the Assyrian spearmen and Napoleonic </p><p>infantry on its right, and the Spartans </p><p>and Northmen on its left The cavalry </p><p>formed two wings extending from </p><p>either flank—the Arabs and Mongols </p><p>forming one wing,.and the Sioux and </p><p>Crusaders the other. </p><p> Ethan raised his arm and waved it in</p><p>signal. </p><p> “Forward!” he yelled, spurring</p><p>ahead. </p><p> His cry was echoed by bellowing of</p><p>Roman buccinas, braying of Mongol </p><p>horns, fierce Sioux war-cries and silver </p><p>blare of French bugles. </p><p> The plain quivered to the resounding</p><p>thunder of thousands of feet and </p><p>hooves trampling forward. The whole </p><p>great host was moving west, horse- </p><p>men in a trot, the footmen in a rapid </p><p>march. </p><p> “Yippee!” yelled Hank Martin ex-</p><p>citedly. “With this outfit, we’ll clean </p><p>up them Masters an’ their soldiers like </p><p>rollin’ off a log.” </p><p> “There are many thousands of the</p><p>Luunians,” warned Ptah. “And they’ll </p><p>have been warned of our coming by </p><p>their horsemen who fled back to the </p><p>city.” </p><p> “We must concentrate on getting</p><p>into the city and storming that fort- </p><p>ress,” Ethan declared tautly. “Chiri </p><p>and John Crewe will be in there—if </p><p>they still live.” </p><p> “We’ll tear the cursed place down</p><p>stone by stone if we have to!” swore </p><p>Lopez. </p><p>T*\ust arose in a great cloud as the </p><p>■L' trampling host moved onward.</p><p>Mile after mile fell behind them, while </p><p>Ethan’s anxiety rose to fever pitch as </p><p>he saw the red disk of the sun swinging </p><p>ever higher. </p><p> “We’re going to be too late!” Kim</p><p>Idim cried, the old man’s face deathly </p><p>as he rode. “It lacks but an hour of </p><p>noon—we shall never make it in time.” </p><p>“We’ve got to,” Ethan declared vio- </p><p>lently. “Chiri and John Crewe await </p><p>death there—we must go faster.” </p><p> Ptah shook his head. “The footmen</p><p>cannot march faster than this. They </p><p>would fall exhausted if they tried.” </p><p>“Then I’m going to ride ahead to </p><p>Luun with only the horsemen!” Ethan </p><p>exclaimed desperately. “By riding </p><p>hard, we can make it in time.” </p><p> “You can’t attack that great city</p><p>with only a couple of thousand horse- </p><p>men!” cried Ptah, aghast. “You’ll be </p><p>outnumbered by a hundred to one.” </p><p>Maybe we can cut our way into the </p><p>fortress,” Ethan insisted. “Hank, you </p><p>and Pedro will come with me—ride </p><p>out now to our horsemen and tell them </p><p>wTe’re going ahead. </p><p> “Ptah, you and Swain and Kim</p><p>Idim bring the footmen along as fast </p><p>as you can. If we fail to get into the </p><p>fortress, we may at least hold up that </p><p>cursed Feast until you come up with </p><p>our main forces.” </p><p> Pedro Lopez and the trapper had</p><p>ridden hastily to the wings. Now the </p><p>four bands of horsemen began to forge </p><p>forward on either side, as they galloped </p><p>their steeds. They converged together </p><p>in front of the main host </p><p> Ethan spurred to the van of the</p><p>gathered cavalry, and shouted back to </p><p>them, using the Arabic, and Hank </p><p>Martin repeated in the Indian tongue. </p><p>“We ride ahead to force the strong- </p><p>hold of our enemy! Follow me!” </p><p>Wild Sioux war-whoop and fierce </p><p>Mongol shout, deep Crusader battle- </p><p>cry and fanatic Arabic yell, answered </p><p>ARMIES FROM THE PAST </p><p>79 </p><p>him as the four great forces of horse- </p><p>men spurred forward. </p><p> The mighty host of footmen dropped</p><p>from sight behind them as they gal- </p><p>loped over the plain, Lopez and the </p><p>trapper riding hard on either side of </p><p>Ethan, in the van. </p><p> “Chiri! Chiri!” Ethan kept whisper-</p><p>ing as he rode. He couldn’t lose her </p><p>now. </p><p> The drum of rushing hoofs marked</p><p>the passing of fatally slow minutes. And </p><p>the sun was higher, higher. . . . </p><p> “Thar’s Luun ahead!” yelled Hank</p><p>Martin, pointing a buckskin arm. </p><p> “And the Luunians are starting to</p><p>come out to meet us!” Lopez cried. </p><p> The domes and towers of the city</p><p>had appeared on the horizon ahead. </p><p>Ethan could clearly discern the moun- </p><p>tainous square bulk of the fortress of </p><p>the Masters. </p><p> And he could also see that com-</p><p>panies of Luunian warriors were al- </p><p>ready beginning to march out of the </p><p>city to meet the oncoming hosts of </p><p>whose advance they had had warning. </p><p> “We’ll ride right through them into</p><p>the.city!” he shouted. </p><p> He drew his sword, and as it flashed</p><p>aloft in the sunlight, he turned and </p><p>yelled to the hosts behind. </p><p> “Follow me into the city! Charge</p><p>through these ahead!” </p><p> A chorus of wild yells answered him.</p><p>His two thousand riders massed close </p><p>together as they galloped onward at </p><p>headlong speed. </p><p> The Luunians, commanded by a</p><p>number of the Masters, were hastily </p><p>forming in a long mass across their </p><p>path, just outside the city. Before they </p><p>could complete formation, Ethan’s</p><p>horsemen struck their line like a thun- </p><p>derbolt. </p><p> A delirium of contorted faces and</p><p>flashing swords and spears whirled </p><p>about Ethan at the moment of impact. </p><p>He hacked and stabbed, heard Lopez </p><p>swearing wildly as the Spaniard struck </p><p>like a madman, felt the armored Luun- </p><p>ians in front of them falling and being </p><p>trampled under the hooves of their </p><p>horses. </p><p> And then that reeling moment of ter-</p><p>rific shock and battle was passed, and </p><p>Ethan was aware that he and his hosts </p><p>were through the Luunian forces, were </p><p>galloping now right into the narrow </p><p>streets of the great stone city. </p><p> “To the fortress!” he yelled to</p><p>Lopez and Hank. “If I fall, lead the </p><p>others straight there.” </p><p> “We’ll have to chaw through these</p><p>devils to git there!” shouted the trap- </p><p>per, pointing ahead. </p><p> The narrow stone streets of Luun</p><p>were filling with armored men, war- </p><p>riors who had been making ready to </p><p>follow the others out of the city to </p><p>oppose the coming host. </p><p> The Masters commanding them</p><p>screamed orders in their shrill, inhu- </p><p>man voices. But the commands were </p><p>lost in the crazy roar of battle shouts </p><p>from Ethan’s motley horde as they </p><p>crashed into the streets of Luun. </p><p> “Saint Denis, and at them!” rose</p><p>the deep shout of mailed Crusaders </p><p>wielding swords and battle-axes. </p><p> “Muhamad rasul Ail ah!” screamed</p><p>the fanatic yell of the Arabs as their </p><p>simitars flashed. </p><p> Ethan, as he fought forward,</p><p>glimpsed his Mongols surging ahead in </p><p>a parallel street The swarthy little </p><p>horsemen were forcing their shaggy </p><p>ponies, stabbing viciously. And over </p><p>the whole roar of combat rose the ter- </p><p>rible, piercing war-whoop of the Sioux, </p><p>the red savages clinging like cats to</p><p>their mounts as their bows twanged and </p><p>their tomahawks, clove down through </p><p>helmets and skulls. </p><p>so </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>HPhe headlong rush of Ethan’s forces </p><p>carried them crashing through the </p><p>streets, toward the mountainous bulk </p><p>of the great fortress. But as they en- </p><p>tered the plaza in front of the giant </p><p>structure, Luunian warriors were </p><p>swarming toward them from every </p><p>part of the city, by thousands. </p><p> Over their heads, the gigantic fort-</p><p>ress frowmed like a thundercloud as </p><p>they forced their way towrard the doors. </p><p>Ethan glimpsed Masters running wildly </p><p>in through the entrances. </p><p> “Into the fortress—quick!” he yelled</p><p>to Hank and Lopez, spurring fiercely </p><p>ahead. </p><p> “Hell’s name, what a fight!” gasped</p><p>the Spaniard, his face wet with blood </p><p>and sweat, his eyes wild. </p><p> Ethan and his two comrades, and a</p><p>score of mingled Mongols and Sioux, </p><p>wron to the entrance of the huge build- </p><p>ing. </p><p> They rode right inside, their horses</p><p>slipping and plunging, into great, shad- </p><p>ows stone chambers. </p><p> Here scores of the red Master?</p><p>scuttled before them in terror. A few </p><p>Luunians opposed them. Men died to </p><p>the music of clashing steel and clatter- </p><p>ing hooves in those great shadowy </p><p>chambers, as Ethan’s band forced on- </p><p>wa rd. </p><p> They burst on their steeds into a</p><p>huge circular chamber. At its center </p><p>rose a big, round stone table, with a </p><p>ring of many cushioned seats around </p><p>it. </p><p> Upon the high stone table, fastened</p><p>down by metal fetters, lay a half-hun- </p><p>dred men and girls. Into an incision in </p><p>the arm of each of them had been in- </p><p>serted a thin metal tube, which led </p><p>down from each to one of the cush- </p><p>ioned seats. </p><p> “Dios, what ghastly thing has been</p><p>going on here?” Lopez gasped. </p><p> “This is the Feast of Life of those</p><p>fiends the Masters!” Edian cried. “A </p><p>drinking of the blood of helpless vic- </p><p>tims ! God, if Chiri is dead-” </p><p> Chill horror was freezing his spine</p><p>as he leaped from his horse and ran </p><p>to the high table of victims. For he </p><p>knew now the full hideous nature of </p><p>those red Masters who had come to </p><p>Earth ages before from another world. </p><p> The Masters were vampires, taking</p><p>their food, not naturally, but through </p><p>the blood of others. He guessed that </p><p>it was a custom that they had brought </p><p>from their own native planet, and that </p><p>they had kept it up as a ceremonial rite </p><p>through their generations on Earth. </p><p> “Chiri!” he yelled frantically.</p><p> “Ethan, 1 am here!” cried a weak</p><p>voice. </p><p> Lie leaped up onto the stone table,</p><p>over the supine bodies of helpless vic- </p><p>tims, and found her. </p><p> Chiri was living, but was pale as</p><p>death itself. And her great dark eyes </p><p>had shuddering terror in them as Ethan </p><p>severed her fetters with a sword-stroke. </p><p> “Ethan!” she sobbed as he helped</p><p>her up. “The Masters—they had be- </p><p>gun to drink our life-blood, when the </p><p>alarm of attack halted die dreadful </p><p>Feast.” </p><p> “Loose my bonds, that I may wreak</p><p>God’s vengeance on those unholy chil- </p><p>dren of Satan !” boomed a great, wrrath- </p><p>ful voice. </p><p> “It’s John Crewe!” shouted Hank</p><p>Martin, his taut face lighting. </p><p> The big Puritan lay fettered among</p><p>the other victims. As Lopez shattered </p><p>his metal bonds, Crewe rose, his </p><p>massive face flaming red, eyes flashing </p><p>fanatically. </p><p> “Retribution!” he shouted, snatching</p><p>a sword from the floor. “We shall</p><p>leave not one of those red demons to </p><p>defile God’s green Earth.” </p><p>ARMIES FROM THE PAST </p><p>81 </p><p> “Out of here now!” Ethan yelled,</p><p>leaping back into his saddle, with Chiri </p><p>held tightly in the curve of his left arm. </p><p>"We’ve got to fight back out of Luun.” </p><p> The Puritan climbed to the back of a</p><p>horse from which a slain Mongol had </p><p>fallen. </p><p> With his remaining followers, Ethan</p><p>spurred back out through the shadowy </p><p>stone rooms. </p><p> They burst out into the blazing sun-</p><p>light of the great plaza. And they </p><p>stopped, appalled by what they saw. </p><p> “Trapped!” cried Lopez with an</p><p>oath. </p><p> The two thousand horsemen whom</p><p>Ethan had led into Luun were milling </p><p>in the plaza, attacked by Luunian war- </p><p>riors pouring in solid masses from </p><p>every part of the city, led by screaming </p><p>Masters. They blocked every avenue </p><p>of escape. </p><p>T^THAN and his companions rode into </p><p>the milling mass of Mongols and </p><p>Sioux and Arabs and Crusaders. The </p><p>young American shouted to his sur- </p><p>rounded followers. </p><p> ‘‘Charge—break through into the</p><p>eastern streets!” he yelled, waving his </p><p>reddened sword, Chiri clinging terri- </p><p>fiedly behind him. </p><p> “We’ll never make it,” Hank Mar-</p><p>tin panted. “They got us boxed.” </p><p> The horsemen answered Ethan’s</p><p>shouts by charging determinedly to- </p><p>ward the eastern side of the plaza. But </p><p>solid masses of Luunians were an im- </p><p>passable barrier. The drugged white </p><p>warriors were fighting like demons at </p><p>the urging of the Masters. </p><p> Once more Ethan led his repulsed</p><p>band forward in a desperate charge— </p><p>and again they were dashed back by the </p><p>crowding Luunian hordes. </p><p> “It ain’t no use!” Hank Martin</p><p>cried. The trapper’s face was terrible </p><p>with blood and perspiration, his head </p><p>bare, his rifle-butt broken away. “We’re </p><p>goners!” </p><p> “We’ll take plenty of the dogs with</p><p>us, then,” roared Lopez, foaming with </p><p>rage. </p><p> “Kill the red ones, the sons of</p><p>Satan!” shouted Crewe’s great voice. </p><p>“Rid the earth of as many as we can, </p><p>before we die.” </p><p> The Luunians were pressing forward,</p><p>stabbing up with sword and spear. </p><p>Horses crashed down with their riders, </p><p>bodies piled up, as the red Masters </p><p>urged their hordes on to annihilate the </p><p>trapped horsemen. </p><p> Then through the mad roar of the</p><p>fight came a new sound, a hoarse, </p><p>mighty bellowing through the streets. </p><p> “That’s the buccinas of the Ro-</p><p>mans!” Ethan cried hoarsely. “Ptah </p><p>and Swain have reached Luun with the </p><p>main forces!” </p><p> The hoarse bellowing of the Roman</p><p>trumpets swept nearer, louder. And </p><p>now could be heard the insistent shrill- </p><p>ing of French bugles sounding the </p><p>charge.	v</p><p> In through the city by converging</p><p>streets pushed the host of footmen </p><p>from the past. Along three streets </p><p>clanked the Romans, shields up, swords </p><p>drawn, faces stem as they fought for- </p><p>ward to the hoarse baying of their war- </p><p>trumpets. </p><p> Along streets on either side of their</p><p>advance came the Spartans and French, </p><p>the Greeks striding forward like men </p><p>of bronze in their heavy armor, stolidly </p><p>hewing down all in their way; the in- </p><p>fantry of Napoleon charging with ex- </p><p>cited batde-cries and leveled bayonets. </p><p> And from the south, Ptah was ad-</p><p>vancing at the head of a thousand </p><p>blood-mad, wolf-faced Assyrians, while </p><p>from the opposite direction, Swain</p><p>Njallson and *hree hundred berserk </p><p>82 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>Northmen were smashing with sword </p><p>and ax toward the plaza. </p><p> “Lock at them Masters run!” yelled</p><p>Hank Martin exultantly. </p><p> The red Masters were fleeing, dart-</p><p>ing in all directions frantically as they </p><p>saw their warriors crumpling beneath </p><p>that terrible converging attack. </p><p> And though the drugged, enslaved</p><p>Luunians had fought fiercely until now </p><p>for their rulers, they seemed to become </p><p>bewildered ■when the Masters fled. </p><p>They too gave way and fled. </p><p> In less than an hour, it was all over.</p><p>The last of the unhuman Masters had </p><p>been hunted down and ruthlessly slain. </p><p>And the stupefied Luunians had sur- </p><p>rendered their weapons. </p><p>Tn the plaza in front of the great </p><p>fortress, Ethan stood with his arm </p><p>around Chiri. Besides him were five </p><p>comrades and old Kim Idim. </p><p> And before Ethan in the plaza had</p><p>gathered the thousands of fighting- </p><p>men of different ages who had con- </p><p>quered Luun. Hundreds of their host </p><p>lay dead—but the diousands who still </p><p>lived hailed Ethan with a great shout. </p><p> “You have done wrhat you promised</p><p>to do, have conquered this city,” Ethan </p><p>shouted to them. “Now your work is </p><p>done, for the Masters here are all dead </p><p>and the people of Luun will soon be- </p><p>come normal again, when they are no </p><p>longer drugged. </p><p> “And now,” he continued, “Kim</p><p>Idim will fulfill his part of our promise </p><p>and will send you back to your own </p><p>times and lands. You need but march </p><p>back across the plain to where his </p><p>machine waits, and it will be done.” </p><p>When his words had been translated </p><p>to them all, there was a pause, a buzz </p><p>of thousands of voices. </p><p> Then a French captaiin gave voice</p><p>to his thoughts.</p><p> “We’d rather stay here, now that</p><p>we’re here,” he told Ethan. “This looks </p><p>like a good time, a good world. If </p><p>you let us stay, we’ll follow wherever </p><p>you lead.” </p><p> “Do the rest of you feel that way?”</p><p>Ethan demanded. </p><p> The answrer, when they understood</p><p>his question, was an overwhelming </p><p>affirmative shout. Soldiers of fortune </p><p>all, irifen without ties, they had no desire </p><p>to return. </p><p> “Then you stay!’’ Ethan cried.</p><p>“There are still other Masters in other </p><p>cities—we shall clean them out, one by </p><p>one, until all Earth is rid of those red </p><p>tyrants.” </p><p> He added with a sudden thought,</p><p>“There’ll be legends back in past times </p><p>—legends of a Roman legion that </p><p>strangely vanished, a French regiment </p><p>that never was heard of again, and so </p><p>on. But who back there would dream </p><p>the truth?” </p><p> Chiri, clinging to his arm, cried to</p><p>him anxiously. </p><p> “Then you too are going to stay in</p><p>this time, Ethan—you and your com- </p><p>rades?” </p><p> “I shore am,” drawled Hank Mar-</p><p>tin. “Now there’s a hull tribe of Sioux </p><p>here, I feel kinder at home.” </p><p> “And I remain too,” declared Lopez.</p><p>“If there is fighting ahead, my prowess </p><p>will be sorely needed.” </p><p> Swain said merely, “I stay.” And</p><p>Ptah nodded agreement. </p><p> “And I,” added Crewe. “There be</p><p>many souls here to whom the word of </p><p>God should be taught—by means Gf a </p><p>little force, if necessary.” </p><p> Ethan was holding Chiri tight in his</p><p>arms. </p><p> And Hank Martin burst into a loud</p><p>guffaw.</p><p> “I guess nobody needs to ask if he’s</p><p>stayin’!” the trapper said. </p><p>''The waves around the boat </p><p>parted, and three heads </p><p>appeared in the water.” </p><p>ed Swimmer </p><p> By ROBERT BLOCH</p><p> A horrendous story of the Spanish Main and an unscrupulous English</p><p> pirate—-a tale of the Elixir of Life; and horrible</p><p> red arms that reached out of the sea</p><p>IUKE TREACH bowed and	scented hair rippled most elegantly in</p><p>smirked in the Spanish sunlight	the Caribbean breeze; a breeze that</p><p>as his distinguished passengers	lifted the dainty rufHes at the wrists</p><p>came up the gangplank. Llis curled and	and throat of his rich velvet coat.</p><p> S3</p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> He made a fine figure of a Spanish</p><p>gentleman, did English Luke Treach </p><p>that merry morning, as he stood strok- </p><p>ing his spade beard to hide the ma- </p><p>licious smile which he had managed to </p><p>erase from his lean, browned face, but </p><p>which still persisted about his cruelly </p><p>thin lips. </p><p> Captain Luke Treach bowed then,</p><p>as the old grandee and his daughter as- </p><p>cended, bowed low a second time when </p><p>the white-bearded gentleman addressed </p><p>him as “Captain Obispo.” Treach </p><p>gazed covertly into the aged, aristo- </p><p>cratic face of his passenger, then al- </p><p>lowed his glance to embrace the figure </p><p>of the woman. Abruptly he started, </p><p>jerked erect. </p><p> Now’ Captain Treach had gazed on</p><p>the fine ladies of old England, yes, and </p><p>the plump, rosy-cheeked barmaids, too; </p><p>he had seen the dusky Caribs that </p><p>danced upon the beach; in Cuba and </p><p>Barbados and the Antilles diere were </p><p>dark-eyed Spanish girls that lured with </p><p>sly laughter, and mulatto or mestizo </p><p>maidens savage in the charm of their </p><p>delight. Captain Treach had known </p><p>many women, but there was none to </p><p>compare with the girl who now stood </p><p>before him. </p><p> Her hair was ebony over ivory fore-</p><p>head, her eyes dark diamonds and lips </p><p>warm ruby red. These comparisons </p><p>came naturally to the Captain, for his </p><p>covetous nature was ever ruling. But </p><p>never had it ruled him as it did at this </p><p>moment; he wanted this girl, with her </p><p>maiden beauty of face and her slim, </p><p>young, untaught body curved and lis- </p><p>some for delight. Young, dark, smil- </p><p>ing—Body of Christ! The captain </p><p>swore inwardly as his lips shaped their </p><p>polite greeting. </p><p> Courteously he welcomed Senor</p><p>Montelupe and his daughter to the </p><p>ship. Yes, their cabins were in readi- </p><p>ness, and he trusted that they would be </p><p>comfortable. But certainly, they would </p><p>cast off at once, and might the Blessed </p><p>Savior speed them on a prosperous, un- </p><p>troubled voyage to Mother Spain.</p><p> Guns and men here? Yes, for there</p><p>were pirates—cursed scoundrels, these </p><p>buccaneers; and if they attacked, it was </p><p>best to be ready—though Gracious God </p><p>forbid! </p><p>/Captain Treach escorted Senor </p><p>^ Montelupe and his daughter to </p><p>their cabins, then returned to watch his </p><p>bullies bring up the chests and bags his </p><p>passengers brought with them; chests </p><p>and bags—silk, satin, gold, jewels. </p><p> It made Treach smile. He smiled</p><p>again as he thought of pirates. This </p><p>second smile made his wolfish face as- </p><p>sume an almost beneficent aspect, for it </p><p>was the charitable smile of one well </p><p>pleased with himself. And Captain </p><p>Luke Treach, now known as Captain </p><p>Obispo, but more famous as “English </p><p>Luke,” had good reason to respect his </p><p>cleverness. </p><p> First, he had taken the galleon. Few</p><p>men had been lost, much wealth gained. </p><p>After efficiently disposing of the crew </p><p>and their captain, he had hit upon a </p><p>brilliant idea. Instead of careening off </p><p>some inlet and waiting until intermedi- </p><p>aries reached him to buy and dispose of </p><p>his loot, he would seek a regular port. </p><p> The galleon Golden Crest had been</p><p>bound for Vera Cruz. Very well, he </p><p>would sail for Vera Cruz, rig himself </p><p>out in the captain's garb, and dress his </p><p>men according to Spanish style. He </p><p>and his mates spoke the tongue well— </p><p>with a little careful disguise they would </p><p>pass as Spaniards. On reaching port </p><p>they could dispose of their cargo, cash </p><p>in the booty, and sail away again </p><p>swiftly with no one the wiser. Better </p><p>still, the appearance of the ship would </p><p>THE RED SWIMMER </p><p>35 </p><p>preclude any fuss such as might be oc- </p><p>casioned by its disappearance; there </p><p>would be 110 reprisal, no scouring of </p><p>the seas by Spanish fleets in search of </p><p>English Luke the buccaneer. </p><p> A noble idea, Luke Treach thought</p><p>at the time. And it had worked. With </p><p>the common seamen kept on shipboard </p><p>against any betrayal, he and his lieu- </p><p>tenants had entered town. Officials had </p><p>even been permitted to land on the ship </p><p>and inspect it. Trade had been accom- </p><p>plished without suspicion, and Luke </p><p>was ready to sail. </p><p> Then Commandante Portiz had</p><p>asked him to take passengers. At first </p><p>Luke had demurred, until he had </p><p>learned that Serior Montelupe and his </p><p>daughter were returning to Spain with </p><p>all their wealth. They wanted to leave </p><p>at once; he had been an official and </p><p>there was some scandal. </p><p> Wealthy? Scandal meant money—</p><p>it would be brought aboard ship. Luke </p><p>Treach agreed, and the affair was set- </p><p>tled. </p><p> Now they were ready to set sail, and</p><p>more luck had befallen the clever cap- </p><p>tain. This daughter of Montelupe— </p><p>she was a new treasure, another prize. </p><p> So Treach smiled indulgently when</p><p>he thought of his cunning and what it </p><p>had gained for him. </p><p> But ever business-like, his musing</p><p>abrupdy ceased and his thoughts turned </p><p>to the exigencies of the moment. He </p><p>gave the orders to lift anchor in the </p><p>clarion voice for which he was justly </p><p>famous. </p><p> A moment later he proved that his</p><p>English erudition in the matter of curs- </p><p>ing, as he loosed a fine volley of oaths </p><p>at the half-naked seamen straining at </p><p>the ropes on deck. </p><p> Then Captain Treach sauntered be-</p><p>low, gentleman-like, pausing merely to </p><p>kick aside the sailor who chanced to</p><p>stray across his path carrying a spar- </p><p>piece. He rapped discreetly on the </p><p>cabin door, surreptitiously spat out his </p><p>plug of tobacco and entered the Mon- </p><p>telupe quarters. </p><p>n^HE old man greeted him, but Cap- </p><p> tain Treach had eyes only for the</p><p>appointments he found therein; for the </p><p>piles of brocaded and jeweled cloth </p><p>now removed from their wrappings and </p><p>stacked against the wall; for the jewel- </p><p>caskets and the ingots in the rough sea- </p><p>bags. </p><p> And then he stared at Ynez</p><p>Montelupe, stared with the selfsame </p><p>avidity. All the while he spoke gra- </p><p>ciously enough to the old fool, but his </p><p>gaze burned a blush into the girl’s </p><p>cheeks, and he thought of the night— </p><p>not tonight, but the next, when they </p><p>would be past hail or chance of pursuit. </p><p> He chatted for perhaps an hour.</p><p>Yes, he had an excellent voyage out. </p><p>No, his passage had been free of storm </p><p>or danger from freebooters, though </p><p>that cursed Blackbeard was reputed to </p><p>be in these waters. He fabricated news </p><p>from Spain, glibly explained the death </p><p>at sea of the ship’s padre. He was </p><p>forced to do most of die talking, for </p><p>the doltish old man merely stared at </p><p>him with his liquid, curiously youthful </p><p>brown eyes. Treach didn’t like that </p><p>stare; it held a faint tinge of contempt </p><p>or amusement; but then, he would not </p><p>have to put up with it for long. On </p><p>this thought he took his departure, </p><p>after graciously asking their attendance </p><p>at dinner in his own quarters. </p><p> Upstairs the gentlemanly mood left</p><p>him, and he called for rum and his </p><p>lieutenant, Roger Groat. Groat sham- </p><p>bled into his cabin, mouthing oaths and </p><p>damnation because the lace frippery at </p><p>his wrists dangled into his tankard </p><p>while he was drinking. The red-bearded </p><p>86 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>lieutenant made it known that he was </p><p>sick of wearing these thrice-damned </p><p>Spanish spangles, and the men were </p><p>tired of the masquerade as well. They </p><p>grumbled because they weren’t put </p><p>ashore to amuse themselves with the </p><p>proceeds of the plunder. </p><p> To this information Captain Treach</p><p>listened with occasional frowns. Then </p><p>he told Groat that they would sail on </p><p>only another day, dispose of the old </p><p>fool, and head in for the nearest island </p><p>a few hours off their position at that </p><p>time. </p><p> “Rich, isn’t he?” muttered Groat.</p><p>“Blackie and Tom swore he had bul- </p><p>lion in those bags o’ his.” </p><p> He chuckled, then snickered as he</p><p>brought a hairy paw down on the table </p><p>at which they sat. </p><p> “And the girl’s a beauty. A beaut}7,</p><p>by God, and there’ll be rare sport-” </p><p> Captain Treach raised his hand. A</p><p>slight gesture, but the accompanying </p><p>frown was enough to quell the big man </p><p>into silence. </p><p> “The girl is mine,” he snapped.</p><p>“Mine alone. The swag we’ll divide </p><p>according to our articles, but the girl </p><p>is mine. </p><p> “You and the others will have your</p><p>fill of wenching when we put in, but </p><p>she’s mine.” </p><p> Groat could not restrain a hoarse</p><p>chuckle. </p><p> “I don’t envy her, at that. Remem-</p><p>ber Lucy, on that English ship we </p><p>took ? When you finished with her and </p><p>Salvatore tried to take her, you flayed </p><p>the lass. And I warrant this one would </p><p>prefer the crew’s sport to the other </p><p>end.” </p><p> Captain Treach smiled. “Tell Sal-</p><p>vatore I want wine for dinner. Amon- </p><p>tillado. I want my guests to eat, drink</p><p>and be merry tonight.” </p><p> They both laughed.</p><p>2 </p><p>n^HEY both laughed. This Captain </p><p> Obispo was certainly a witty man.</p><p>And tonight he was out-doing himself. </p><p>Senorita Ynez found her first instinc- </p><p>tive dislike fading, though she still felt </p><p>a tinge of strange panic whenever his </p><p>beady eyes rested too intently upon her </p><p>face or bosom. </p><p> As for Senor Montelupe, his taci-</p><p>turnity waned under the brandy and </p><p>the mellow amontillado sherry. His </p><p>reserve down, he proceeded to let his </p><p>host guide the conversation into per- </p><p>sonal channels. </p><p> Captain Treach asked him about his</p><p>duties in Vera Cruz; learned that the </p><p>old man had held a secretarial post for </p><p>years and owned several lucrative </p><p>mines. There had been a scandal of </p><p>sorts. . . . </p><p> Money, the captain presumed. No,</p><p>not exactly money. The old man’s re- </p><p>ticence held him silent for a moment, </p><p>but the wine, the courtesy, the mood </p><p>urged him on. His bright eyes grew </p><p>shadowy as he spoke. </p><p> There was — was the captain a</p><p>church-goer? </p><p> Something in the shadowed eyes cued</p><p>Treach to ignore the natural lie and </p><p>speak truly. No, he was not a son of </p><p>the Mother Church. </p><p> That was well, said Senor Monte-</p><p>lupe. For there was a charge against </p><p>him, a charge of sorcery. </p><p> Yes, the Black Arts, as ignorant</p><p>fools called them—the mantic arts. Lie </p><p>had studied with the Moorish masters </p><p>in Spain as a youth; not wizardry or </p><p>witchcraft, but the true magics that lie </p><p>in nature; aeromancy, the controlling </p><p>of winds; hydromancy, divination and </p><p>command of waters; pyromancy, the </p><p>lore of fire. It was science, not sorcery,</p><p>which he sought to rule, and the ancient </p><p>THE RED SWIMMER </p><p>87 </p><p>Moors held secrets of natural wisdom </p><p>known to seers before Solomon. </p><p> Here in this new world he had</p><p>availed himself of his governmental </p><p>position to study certain things; it </p><p>would be wise for one so old to take </p><p>heed of the Elixir Vitas, the Elixir of </p><p>Life. </p><p> And native blood was cheap;</p><p>slaves and peons died by the dozens in </p><p>the mines each day, perished by flog- </p><p>ging and torture. He had meant no </p><p>harm; he wanted to kill no one, but </p><p>merely to study the blood of a few </p><p>slaves, to experiment with revivifica- </p><p>tion of the dead—that did no harm. </p><p>And he had discovered things—mar- </p><p>velous secrets, gathered from the wis- </p><p>dom of Egyptis, the Orient, the Arab </p><p>sages. In his hands he would use his </p><p>knowledge for good, not evil. </p><p> But the natives complained, the</p><p>people whispered, and the alcalde told </p><p>the padre, who in turn brought tidings </p><p>to the Commandante. And so Senor </p><p>Montelupe had given up his post, taken </p><p>his daughter—his wife was dead these </p><p>many years, alas!—and departed for </p><p>home. </p><p> Luke listened, with a polite show of</p><p>interest. No need to antagonize the </p><p>old duffer. He and his talk of magic— </p><p>but then, what could one expect from </p><p>a bloody Spaniard?—those fools were </p><p>all alike with their Inquisition, and </p><p>witch-burning, and alchemy. </p><p> Alchemy! The thought crossed his</p><p>mind even as he nodded in polite as- </p><p>sent to the grandee’s words. Alchemy </p><p>—the transmutation of base metals into </p><p>gold, wasn’t it? Perhaps this stupid </p><p>Southern dog knew something. Best </p><p>to draw him out. </p><p>T UKE drew him out, aided by further </p><p>drafts of wine. He politely hinted </p><p>that a man of Senor Montelupe’s wis- </p><p>dom must have uncovered secrets in his </p><p>quest of baleful knowledge.</p><p> Senor Montelupe stroked his gray</p><p>beard as he replied that he had uncov- </p><p>ered secrets. His eyes flamed with a </p><p>bright gleam of fanaticism as he leaned </p><p>across the great cabin-table. </p><p> He, Montelupe, had succeeded in his</p><p>experiments. Men had sought the </p><p>Elixir of Life in ancient lands for cen- </p><p>turies untold, without avail. Charm, </p><p>incantation, invocation — all methods </p><p>had failed. But he had come to a new </p><p>world, and there his efforts had been </p><p>crowned with triumph. It was a great </p><p>discovery; much toil and study had </p><p>gone into it, and not a little blood. It </p><p>was not generally known, but his wife </p><p>had died from an injection of a spuri- </p><p>ous Elixir he had compounded in ear- </p><p>lier studies. Since then the tragic fail- </p><p>ure had spurred him on, and many </p><p>slaves had been sacrificed to the attain- </p><p>ment of perfection. But he had done </p><p>it—there was a vial filled with a golden </p><p>liquid; not the mythical water of poor </p><p>Ponce de Leon’s Fountain of Youth, </p><p>but the veritable Elixir Vitae. Its com- </p><p>poundment had cost Senor Montelupe </p><p>many years of his life, but now when </p><p>he returned to Spain with his wealth, </p><p>he and his daughter would be insured </p><p>eternity—eternity in which to study, to </p><p>seek further wisdom. </p><p> Luke Treach frowned and swore</p><p>damnation to himself. The blasted </p><p>idiot was mad! No alchemical secrets </p><p>here, no Philosopher’s Stone, or any- </p><p>thing real; only this demented gibber- </p><p>ish about some crazy scheme of per- </p><p>petual life. The Spanish dog bored </p><p>him; for that he would pay on the mor- </p><p>row. And she would pay, too—Ynez, </p><p>listening with a cryptic smile that im- </p><p>plied belief in her father’s words, and </p><p>a covert glimmer in her eyes which </p><p>proclaimed that she thought the captain </p><p>88 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>an ignorant fool, incapable of under- </p><p>standing the magnitude of her sire’s se- </p><p>crets. </p><p> Yes, he would pay, and she would</p><p>pay—though in sweeter coinage. </p><p> With that thought hidden in his po-</p><p>litely-phrased adieu, Luke Treach </p><p>strode up on deck for a breath of fresh </p><p>air; air untainted by this fool’s talk of </p><p>wizardry and enchantment. </p><p> He checked the position, oversaw</p><p>the change of watch at the wheel, and </p><p>retired to sleep against the morrow’s </p><p>sport. </p><p>■\TiGHT clouds had scudded before the </p><p>dawn, and the sun ruled azure </p><p>southern heavens ere he awoke. The </p><p>cabin window showed him beauty of </p><p>sea and sky, but his ears heard sounds </p><p>most unlovely. </p><p> This was the day, and the men were</p><p>drunk. Groat had evidently broken </p><p>out the rum. </p><p> Cursing, Treach ran up on deck, and</p><p>found shambles. The Go!den Crest </p><p>drifted, unpiloted. Laughing, gleeful </p><p>men overran the ship, moving about at </p><p>will or clustering before the broached </p><p>casks that stood upon the after-deck. </p><p>The English sea-dogs had abandoned </p><p>their Spanish costumes in favor of pi- </p><p>rate regalia, or utter nakedness. </p><p> Treach saw his steward, Salvatore,</p><p>slopping rum over his maroon coat with </p><p>the white piping, then wiping his red </p><p>mouth with the lacy sleeve that had </p><p>once graced the arm of a Portuguese </p><p>admiral of war. Lie saw Roger Groat- </p><p>slapping his naked, tattooed thighs with </p><p>the flat of a cutlass as he danced about </p><p>“One-Light” Samuel Slew, whose black </p><p>eye-patch was the sole incongruous note </p><p>in the ensemble he wore—the grotesque </p><p>finery of some silken lady whose de- </p><p>nuded body had long since passed to the </p><p>mercies of the sharks. The rest roared </p><p>and bellowed forth crude gibes, or</p><p>shouted toasts over the swilling of their </p><p>tankards. </p><p> Treach paused. The men had broken</p><p>discipline, but they were in a jovial </p><p>mood and order could be restored. But </p><p>what matter? Their drinking could </p><p>have waited until night, as planned, but </p><p>a few hours made no difference now. </p><p>Let them have their sport. And he— </p><p>now he could go below and seek Ynez. </p><p> He went, smiling.</p><p> Ynez and her father were staring out</p><p>of the cabin window, their eyes veiled </p><p>with perplexity. </p><p> “What does this mean, Captain?”</p><p>asked the old man, as Treach entered. </p><p>Then his face betrayed that he knew </p><p>the answer. </p><p> For Treach had entered without</p><p>knocking, and he had entered not as </p><p>Captain Obispo, but as English Luke </p><p>—swaggering, his smile a sneer. </p><p> “What does this mean?” Ynez</p><p>echoed, in a faint voice tiiat trailed </p><p>away beneath the intensity of Treach’s </p><p>stare. </p><p> Treach laughed.</p><p> “Mean? It means a lot, I fancy.</p><p>Firstly, that you’ve made a mistake in </p><p>taking passage with us. Ye see, we’ve </p><p>changed our colors—we’re an English </p><p>crew, not Spanish, and we fly still a </p><p>third flag today, I fancy. Have ye </p><p>heard of the Jolly Roger?” </p><p> He grinned. His bow was a mock-</p><p>ery of previous courtliness. </p><p> “So it’s English Luke Treach at yer</p><p>service today, my friends.” </p><p> “Buccaneer!” The old Spaniard</p><p>scowled, then drew Ynez close to his </p><p>side. She trembled in her father’s </p><p>arms, but her terror invested her with </p><p>a weird enhancing of beauty; the beauty </p><p>of a frightened fawn. Luke stared at </p><p>the softness of her black eyes, at the </p><p>trembling of her fear-taut body. </p><p>THE RED SWIMMER </p><p>89 </p><p> He stared so closely that he did not</p><p>see the sudden gesture of the old man </p><p>■—did not observe his hand slip a tiny </p><p>golden vial from his pocket to the </p><p>bodice of his daughter. </p><p> He stared at the girl, and then he</p><p>began to laugh. The laugh told all. It </p><p>told Senor Montelupe that he need not </p><p>waste words in threats or pleas. It told </p><p>Ynez Montelupe that which made her </p><p>crimson with shame. </p><p> Laughing, the pirate advanced. This</p><p>time he saw the second movement of </p><p>the old man—saw the silver dagger slid </p><p>from the sleeve and raised on high. But </p><p>his laughter did not cease as he tore the </p><p>cutlass from its scabbard at his side. </p><p>The blade slashed down upon the Span- </p><p>iard's wrist. When it struck it seemed </p><p>as though the steel had sent sparks fly- </p><p>ing, but it was only blood, spurting </p><p>forth in tiny gouts as the hand fell sev- </p><p>ered to the cabin floor. </p><p> The old man cried out; then Luke</p><p>was upon him, lifting the graybeard </p><p>bodily and carrying him from the cabin. </p><p>On deck he collared Roger Groat and </p><p>kicked the form of the fainting grandee </p><p>to indicate his prize. </p><p> “Amuse yourself,” he instructed the</p><p>lieutenant. ££I go below again.” </p><p> “Amuse yourself ” parroted Groat,</p><p>leering. </p><p> Treach good-naturedly pushed the</p><p>man in the face with the flat of his wet </p><p>blade, and went down the stairs again. </p><p>ONCE more he entered the cabin, and </p><p>saw that Ynez still stood there. She </p><p>faced him now and she did not cringe. </p><p>Her features held no fear, for they </p><p>were set in the immobility of death. </p><p>Only her eyes were alive—so dread- </p><p>fully, so intently alive that Luke </p><p>Treach stood staring aghast into their </p><p>black depths. His own face twisted as </p><p>though seared by the black flame that </p><p>leapt forth from her burning orbs^</p><p>Then he mastered himself and ad- </p><p>vanced. </p><p> “Ye’d best pull no tricks with me,</p><p>girl,” he muttered. </p><p> Her dead face smiled a dead smile</p><p>—the mirthless smile of a corpse that </p><p>crawls to feed. And her voice spoke, </p><p>muffled as though it came from the un- </p><p>der-earth. </p><p> “I fear ye not,” said Ynez. “I fear</p><p>no man, and no thing. Ye had best </p><p>fear me” </p><p> Her tone was leaden, and the words</p><p>were heavy against Luke Treach’s ears. </p><p>He grimaced, shrugged in a bravado </p><p>he did not feel. </p><p> “Enough of this!” he growled.</p><p>“Come, lass-” </p><p> “Wait.”</p><p> Luke paused.</p><p>“Ye shall have will over me, if ye </p><p>must. But dog though thou art, I warn </p><p>thee still. My father gave me this.” </p><p>She held up the little golden vial. It </p><p>was empty. </p><p> “Ye heard what it contained—the</p><p>precious distillation which insures </p><p>eternal life. I drank of it. And so I </p><p>warn thee. I cannot die, and the hatred </p><p>within me cannot die. Use me as thou </p><p>wilt; yea, cast me into the sea”—her </p><p>eyes flamed—“but I shall return, Luke </p><p>Treach. I shall return. And there will </p><p>be reckoning.” </p><p> For a moment the buccaneer trem-</p><p>bled with instinctive horror. Then the </p><p>wine mounted to his brain, and as the </p><p>light faded from the girl’s eyes he </p><p>stepped across the cabin with a hoarse </p><p>laugh. Ynez threw the empty vial in </p><p>his face, but he only grinned. </p><p>3 </p><p>T uke Treach stumbled from the </p><p>cabin with a curse—stumbled with </p><p>the body of the swooning girl across</p><p>90 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>his shoulder. Lurching figures moved </p><p>in the dusk, snarling and laughing in </p><p>drunken animation. </p><p> Treach cursed savagely as he sought</p><p>the deck and made for a group of hud- </p><p>dling men that clustered about the </p><p>mast. </p><p> He was rather surprised to see that</p><p>old Senor Montelupe was still alive, </p><p>considering what had been done to him. </p><p> The old grandee was nailed to the</p><p>mast most painfully, by his remaining </p><p>hand. </p><p> The men turned to Treach and re-</p><p>garded him with bleary eyes. </p><p> “What’ll we do, Cap’n?” demanded</p><p>Groat, moving to the pirate’s side. “A </p><p>tough old bird, this vulture. He’ll not </p><p>die and he’ll not be still. He hangs </p><p>there and curses and prays in his Span- </p><p>ish, damme if he don’t.” </p><p> Treach smiled wolfishly.</p><p> “Perhaps I can devise a new diver-</p><p>sion,” he said. </p><p> There was snickering, for the buckos</p><p>knew their captain. They watched as </p><p>he threw the swooning Ynez to the </p><p>deck, and the mangled head of Mon- </p><p>telupe turned to follow Treach’s move- </p><p>ments. </p><p> The captain’s knife flashed, and the</p><p>anguished old man moaned aloud, as </p><p>he cast the terribly altered form over </p><p>the vessel’s side. Then Treach faced </p><p>the father. The gray Spaniard stared </p><p>from tortured eyes until Luke’s face </p><p>fell in shame. </p><p> “Fool!” The voice rang faint, but</p><p>vibrant with hatred. “Fool!” </p><p> Luke wished to turn away, but those</p><p>eyes, that voice, held him prisoner be- </p><p>fore the victim. </p><p> “There is vengeance for fools,”</p><p>hissed the old man. “I’ve prayed to </p><p>Powers while your dogs tormented me; </p><p>prayed to Powers over wind and water. </p><p>You and your currish crew are doomed, </p><p>I	swear—and your torment shall not</p><p>end there.” </p><p> Was this death-racked horror really</p><p>smiling? </p><p> Luke shuddered. He stepped for-</p><p>ward, blenching before the madman’s </p><p>eyes. For the old man was mum- </p><p>bling. </p><p> To the crew, it appeared as if Mon-</p><p>telupe were whispering in confidence to </p><p>Treach, for the captain bent his head </p><p>close to the ravaged face, and the Span- </p><p>iard’s lips moved. It was hard to hear </p><p>what he was saying. </p><p> “Vengeance . . . my daughter . . .</p><p>elixir . . . nothing can stop life that will </p><p>flow eternally through veins . . . noth- </p><p>ing can stop hate . . . vengeance for </p><p>you . . . return.” </p><p> In the gathering shadow it was diffi-</p><p>cult for the men to see the expression </p><p>on their captain’s face. Could it be fear </p><p>at the dying man’s whispers? </p><p> But a moment later everyone wit-</p><p>nessed their captain’s rage. For sud- </p><p>denly the horrid head writhed as the </p><p>old Spaniard spat full in Treach’s face. </p><p> Then a sword flashed out, and a red-</p><p>daubed head rolled across the deck. At </p><p>that moment the sky bled, and crimson </p><p>waters bubbled against the sunset. </p><p>When the maimed body went over the </p><p>side, the waters stirred with a new tur- </p><p>bulence, and a wind sprang up from </p><p>the flaming western sky. </p><p> Treach shuddered even as he cursed,</p><p>noting the silence of his companions, </p><p>their furtive looks and gesturings. The </p><p>imbecile had awed them with his curses </p><p>—faith, but it was lucky they had not </p><p>heard what the old devil had said there </p><p>at the last! Still, his wizard babbling </p><p>was working on these superstitious </p><p>fools. </p><p> With an effort, Luke met the mood</p><p>and mastered it. He shouted for fresh </p><p>rum, roundly cuffed the nearest mem- </p><p>'THE RED SWIMMER </p><p>91 </p><p>bers of the crew, and swaggered for- </p><p>ward. </p><p> After a time his mates followed, and</p><p>the warm bite of the liquor soon ban- </p><p>ished morbid melancholy. </p><p> They drank as sunset smoldered into</p><p>dusk, drank as the dark clouds of night </p><p>fled before the rise of wailing winds; </p><p>drank even as the waters lashed the </p><p>ship through trough and swell. For </p><p>now white waves raced and reared, and </p><p>the sea began to boil and bubble as </p><p>though heated at some devil's cauldron </p><p>from below. </p><p>"VTear midnight the storm broke, and </p><p>the rain lashed the drunken rois- </p><p>terers from the deck. It was then that </p><p>several awoke from their bemusement, </p><p>but it was too late. </p><p> The Golden Crest whirled in an an-</p><p>gry sea amidst a wind that shrieked </p><p>and tore at sail and spar. Treach </p><p>roared futile orders to the scant dozen </p><p>of his crew that he could muster, but </p><p>these did not avail. No one dared go </p><p>aloft or brave the gale above the deck. </p><p>Even when the mast fell, the panic- </p><p>crazed men were helpless to forestall </p><p>further disaster. </p><p> The black night howled about them,</p><p>and the sea surged over the decks as </p><p>the ship heeled against the storm. </p><p>Floundering figures were tossed </p><p>screaming over the side as the waters </p><p>retreated; cursing sailors blundered in </p><p>the darkness as the yard-arms crashed </p><p>about them to splinter the deck and </p><p>cabins into a shambles. </p><p> Some there were who made a break</p><p>for the boats. Five or six lifted one </p><p>over the side and clambered in, just as </p><p>a new wave struck. They dashed to </p><p>death against the bows as the craft </p><p>smashed to bits before the flooding im- </p><p>pact of the water. </p><p> The ship lurched madly. It was</p><p>leaking, foundering—that was a cer-</p><p>tainty. Treach collared Roger Groat, </p><p>Salvatore, Samuel Slew, and as many </p><p>others as he could shake into con- </p><p>sciousness. His orders were curt, </p><p>oath-weighted. They dashed below, re- </p><p>turning with rations, water-jugs. A </p><p>great combing wave crashed over the </p><p>deck, then subsided as the men dashed </p><p>for another boat. </p><p> They made it, lowered the ropes and</p><p>floundered in, casting off just in time to </p><p>escape the flooding fury that spent it- </p><p>self against the vessel’s side. </p><p> Rowing was madness in these swirl-</p><p>ing waters, but they pushed away in </p><p>time. </p><p> Already the great vessel was rear-</p><p>ing and plunging in the throes of </p><p>final surrender. It rose and sank, and </p><p>above the storm came the sound of </p><p>faint shrieks as those left behind real- </p><p>ized the imminence of their doom. </p><p> Then, with a geyser-burst, the waters</p><p>boiled above the ship, poising against </p><p>the ruined mast-stumps before they </p><p>hurled down to smash the vessel to </p><p>ruins. </p><p> With a rumble, they fell and claimed</p><p>their own. The craft rose up, tilted </p><p>at the bow, and fell into the gigan- </p><p>tic trough as the wave crashed down </p><p>upon it. There was a single mighty </p><p>roar of triumph as the ship slid into the </p><p>sea; then foaming waters closed about </p><p>it, and a terrible circle spread and </p><p>widened from the point of its disap- </p><p>pearance. </p><p> Treach and the men met the shock,</p><p>though two yammering forms disap- </p><p>peared under the drenching violence of </p><p>die inundation and were sucked down </p><p>by die hungry depths. </p><p> Then they tossed all alone in the</p><p>black storm amidst the sound of gigan- </p><p>tic laughter, and the booming wind </p><p>mocked them through the night. </p><p>92 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>4 </p><p>Tt WAS calm as death die next rr.orn- </p><p> ing, and the waves purred against</p><p>the side of the boat as though in sat- </p><p>isfaction at the appeasement of their </p><p>hunger. </p><p> The weary men slept as the sun</p><p>rose; Treach huddled forward over the </p><p>provisions, Roger Groat bent over his </p><p>oar, Salvatore stretched across his seat, </p><p>Sam Slew and Gorlac lying supine in </p><p>the dampness at the bottom of the </p><p>craft. </p><p> It was Gorlac who woke first; Gor-</p><p>lac, the gigantic Krooman. His brutal </p><p>negroid face wrinkled into a frGwn as </p><p>he surveyed his sleeping companions </p><p>and the empty sea in which they drifted. </p><p>Then his eyes fell upon the two water- </p><p>casks, the oiled sea-bag of provisions </p><p>at the captain’s side. He stretched black </p><p>ape-arms forward, ate and drank </p><p>noisily. </p><p> Treach chose this moment to awake,</p><p>and for a second he stared at the giant </p><p>Negro, who sat obliviously munching </p><p>a slab of bully-beef. Then he snarled </p><p>an oath and drew his knife. In a mo- </p><p>ment he had flung himself forward on </p><p>the startled black and buried his blade </p><p>in the gleaming ebon column of the </p><p>corded neck. </p><p> Gorlac grunted in pain, and crushed</p><p>the captain’s body in a terrible embrace. </p><p>Llis arms tightened as Treach tore the </p><p>knife from the wound in the neck and </p><p>stabbed again and again at the dark </p><p>back. </p><p> The Negro, grimacing with mad</p><p>pain, locked his great hands about the </p><p>pirate’s neck and squeezed—squeezed </p><p>terribly, with sobs of agony as he </p><p>sought to throttle his foe. Then Treach </p><p>slid the knife around to the ribs, arched </p><p>upward in a silver slash, and disem- </p><p>boweled his antagonist. The ape-paws </p><p>relaxed their grip, and the captain slid</p><p>the twitching body over the side. </p><p> It fell with a splash, and disap-</p><p>peared. The captain crawled back to </p><p>his place, feeling his throat experi- </p><p>mentally to make sure that all was </p><p>well; then polishing his knife carefully </p><p>on his breeches. Lie looked up to face </p><p>the stares of his awakened companions. </p><p>The scuffle had taken place so quickly </p><p>that the men were still rubbing their </p><p>eyes and grumbling their bewilderment. </p><p> “Gorlac’s gone,” announced Treach,</p><p>in a harsh voice. “A.nd damn my lights </p><p>and liver, the rest of ye curs will go too </p><p>if I catch ye tampering with the pro- </p><p>visions.” </p><p> He took cut a small stone from his</p><p>blouse and began to sharpen his knife, </p><p>gazing meaningly at his audience. They </p><p>sat stolid, each man looking off into </p><p>the empty sea and thinking his own </p><p>thoughts. </p><p> Luke mused with the rest. His mind</p><p>was teeming in turmoil. First thoughts </p><p>were pangs of regret as he remembered </p><p>the fine ship, the fine crew he had lost </p><p>—and more tragic still, the stores of </p><p>bullion and silver ingots; the money- </p><p>chests gleaned from trading off loot for </p><p>gold doubloons and pieces-of-eight. </p><p>And there had been a small fortune in </p><p>the silks and jewels and moneys left by </p><p>his two passengers as well. It was all </p><p>lost. </p><p> Further reflection was brought to</p><p>bear on his own plight; adrift here in </p><p>the boundless sea with three men, an </p><p>open boat, and water and provisions </p><p>for perhaps two days. </p><p> From these ponderings his thoughts</p><p>strayed off into darker considerations. </p><p>Luke Treach was a practical man and </p><p>an all-round materialistic scoundrel to </p><p>boot, but he could not help but remem- </p><p>ber the strange dying words of the </p><p>Spaniard — he who claimed mantic </p><p>THE RED SWIMMER </p><p>93 </p><p>powers. The wretch may have been </p><p>raving, but he spoke of aeromancy, </p><p>power over wind and water, and of con- </p><p>juring up a storm. The storm had </p><p>come. And the seer had cursed him </p><p>with other things. . . . </p><p> But enough! A little food, a little</p><p>water, a few attempts at formulating </p><p>a plan; these were the things he needed </p><p>to drive such foolishness from his brain. </p><p> He apportioned a meager fare of</p><p>beef and hard-tack to the three surviv- </p><p>ors of his crew, and snapped orders for </p><p>rowing assignments and night watches. </p><p>Dark grinning Salvatore, big dour </p><p>Groat and the leanly sinister “Dead- </p><p>Light” Slew listened stolidly to his com- </p><p>mands and set to. </p><p> But rowing is onerous, and the broil-</p><p>ing sun of the mid-Caribbean no kindly </p><p>overseer. The sea is a lonely place, and </p><p>last night these men had glimpsed </p><p>Death with jaws agape to swallow. </p><p>Now they feared that those jaws would </p><p>close about them again, not to engulf </p><p>but to gnaw slowly with the sharp teeth </p><p>of thirst and hunger. </p><p>rpHE day passed in sullen, apprehen- </p><p>-Lsive silence; Groat and Slew, then </p><p>Treach and Salvatore, taking the oars </p><p>while the alternate pair rested and tried </p><p>to shield their eyes from the eternal </p><p>glare. </p><p> Row—but where? There was no</p><p>compass, and until the stars shone guid- </p><p>ance was missing. Treach hoped to put </p><p>south to the islands, and the sun’s de- </p><p>ceptive shimmer showed him the way </p><p>none too truly. </p><p> Nevertheless the labor kept the men</p><p>from thinking too much; kept them </p><p>from remembering little things that </p><p>now came to slyly torment Treach. </p><p>There had been a little golden vial, </p><p>and the wizard had sworn a vengeance. </p><p>What was that about Eternal Life? </p><p>Couldn’t torture kill? What did it </p><p>mean?</p><p> Sunset again—flaming sunset, like</p><p>that in which Montelupe had died. He </p><p>had died; the dead harm no one. She </p><p>too could harm no one, now. </p><p> But it was night. Captain Treach</p><p>apportioned the food in darkness, </p><p>watched his companions at the water </p><p>to insure that they were not over- </p><p>greedy. </p><p> Treach snapped commands, set the</p><p>course by the stars. The men hauled </p><p>at the oars in silence, and the boat </p><p>glided through black waters. </p><p> Groat and Slew labored. Salvatore</p><p>dropped off to sleep, his swarthy face </p><p>buried in his hands as he huddled up </p><p>against the forward seat. Treach kept </p><p>awake by sheer will, cursing mechan- </p><p>ically at the oarsmen, so that the sound </p><p>of his voice might drown out the </p><p>greater sound of the Silence — the </p><p>empty Silence of rolling waters. The </p><p>very rustle and lap of the waves seemed </p><p>to become a part of a maddening still- </p><p>ness that sapped the mind. The night </p><p>sea was an entity that crawled about </p><p>them. Treach felt this, although no </p><p>concrete thought was formulated. But </p><p>his instinct awakened him to fear; fear </p><p>which the silent sea now personified. </p><p>Here, drifting alone in black infinitude, </p><p>the Powers of which the dead wizard </p><p>had spoken assumed new reality. It </p><p>was easy for the tired imagination to </p><p>conceive of vast pulsing shapes, em- </p><p>bodiments of the night and the wind </p><p>and the water. </p><p> Treach felt his burning forehead,</p><p>drew the back of his hand over Ups </p><p>cracked with fever. </p><p> He fell asleep while the waters mur-</p><p>mured. In his dreams the water was </p><p>whispering. From far away it whis- </p><p>pered—from behind the boat. The </p><p>whispering grew louder. It was right </p><p>94 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>behind the boat now. He could almost </p><p>hear words floating up out of the water. </p><p>The whispering was trying to tell him </p><p>something — something about venge- </p><p>ance, and a curse—right under the boat </p><p>now. . . . </p><p> There was a scream of utter agony.</p><p>HPreach wrenched himself from </p><p>sleep, sat bolt-upright as the scream </p><p>trailed off into a gurgling noise in the </p><p>blackness. </p><p> “What’s that?” he shouted to his</p><p>companions. </p><p> For a moment there was no answer.</p><p>Groat’s face was buried in trembling </p><p>hands. </p><p> Salvatore heard him, but when</p><p>he opened his mouth it merely hung </p><p>loosely, without moving in speech. And </p><p>Slew was gone. </p><p> “Where’s Sam?” shouted Treach.</p><p>Salvatore managed to regain partial </p><p>control of his jaws. </p><p> “He—gone,” the swarthy man splut-</p><p>tered. “It came over the side and took </p><p>him—it was kissing him and then it </p><p>pulled him into the water—it took him </p><p>—santo Dios-” </p><p> Then Treach was upon Salvatore,</p><p>shaking his shoulders and shrieking </p><p>into his very face. </p><p> “What took him, damme? Speak up,</p><p>man, for the love of heaven!” </p><p> “I not know,” whimpered the other.</p><p>“I not know. We row here, and then </p><p>Slew he stop rowing. I take the oar. </p><p>He just sit there at end of boat. All </p><p>at once he say, ‘Listen.’ I listen, hear </p><p>nothing. ‘Listen,’ he say. ‘I hear </p><p>whisper.’ I tell him he crazy. But he </p><p>just sit and look at water and say, ‘It </p><p>getting louder.’ All at once he lean </p><p>down, and then—sacramento!—two </p><p>arms come up out of water and go</p><p>around his neck. He just scream once </p><p>and then over side he go. No splash, </p><p>no bubbles. He go, and I see arms—* </p><p>all red arms. All red!” </p><p> As the big man slumped down in the</p><p>boat Treach peered wildly at the black </p><p>waters about him. They were still, un- </p><p>ruffled. No body, no rippling. </p><p> “You’re daft, man,” he whispered,</p><p>but there was no conviction in his voice. </p><p> “Those red arms,” Groat muttered,</p><p>from behind. “I never believed in mer- </p><p>maids or sea-monsters, but-” </p><p> “Shut up, both of you! You’re crazy!</p><p>Slew fell overboard, that’s all. Fever’s </p><p>got you. There’s nothing in the water </p><p>but sharks. And they have no arms.’5 </p><p>“You threw something in water with </p><p>arms,” Salvatore mumbled. </p><p> Treach struck the man across the</p><p>mouth. “Shut up!” he screamed. “Let </p><p>me alone.” </p><p> Silently, he sat there until dawn</p><p>arose, and when he saw its redness, he </p><p>shuddered. </p><p>rptiEY were all mad now, food and </p><p>water gone, Slew gone. And the </p><p>sun, searing down, cooked the madness </p><p>into their brains until thoughts writhed </p><p>and twisted amidst flames. </p><p> Salvatore wouldn’t row any more.</p><p>He kept staring at the wrater behind </p><p>the boat while Treach and Groat </p><p>worked the oars. Treach watched him. </p><p>Toward midday Salvatore turned. </p><p>“There,” he whispered. “I know. I </p><p>know it come. I see it. There in the </p><p>water. It following us. Swimming in </p><p>water. Oh, Cap’n, look there.” </p><p> “Shut up !” But Treach looked. It</p><p>was only sunlight glinting on the waves </p><p>behind. </p><p> “Look. It move again!”</p><p> Something was moving, away back.</p><p> “Sharks, you fool!”</p><p> “Sharks are not red.”</p><p> “Shut up!”</p><p> They pulled the oars, but Salvatore</p><p>THE RED SWIMMER </p><p>95 </p><p>gazed back as sunset dripped blood </p><p>upon the waves. He was trembling and </p><p>his face was soaking with perspiration </p><p>not born of heat alone. </p><p> “Let us all stay awake tonight,” he</p><p>whispered. “Maybe we pray and it go </p><p>away. Otherwise-” </p><p> “Quiet!” Treach snapped the com-</p><p>mand with his old authority. </p><p> But the authority was in his voice</p><p>alone now. Inside, Luke Treach was </p><p>afraid. </p><p> When the sun went down he heard</p><p>the whispering at once. It welled out </p><p>of the black waters, and he prayed that </p><p>the moon might rise at once. Hearing </p><p>that whispering in the blackness was </p><p>too much. He turned toward the back </p><p>of the boat. He’d talk to Salvatore, </p><p>anything, just drown out that growing </p><p>whisper. He turned—and saw. </p><p> The big man was on his knees. He</p><p>was leaning over the gunwale. His </p><p>arms were outstretched and he was </p><p>staring down into the black water, his </p><p>face icy with horror. </p><p> And two arms were rising out of the</p><p>water—two long, red arms. They were </p><p>pinkly phosphorescent in the darkness. </p><p>They glowed like—like stripped flesh. </p><p> The arms reached out, twin serpents</p><p>that embraced. Treach tried to call </p><p>out, to motion to Groat. Lie was </p><p>frozen, frozen as the arms rose, em- </p><p>braced Salvatore. And silently, the big </p><p>man toppled over the side. The splash </p><p>broke the spell. </p><p> “Quick!” Treach screamed. Groat</p><p>followed him on his hands and knees </p><p>as they thrashed their oars in the black- </p><p>ness of the waves. Nothing moved, </p><p> “Sharks move a lot,” Groat mut-</p><p>tered, in a hoarse voice. “Sharks move, </p><p>and octopus move. But this—you </p><p>saw?” </p><p> “I didn’t see anything,” Treach lied.</p><p>“He was mad. Threw himself over.” </p><p> “Drowning men move,” Groat</p><p>croaked. </p><p> Treach mastered himself. “Row,”</p><p>he commanded. “For God’s sake, row, </p><p>man! We must reach land before to- </p><p>morrow night.” </p><p> They rowed as though Deadi were</p><p>at their heels. And in their hearts it </p><p>was this they feared. They rowed past </p><p>midnight; tired, feverish, aflame with </p><p>thirst and hunger. But Fear called </p><p>their strokes, and Fear drove the boat </p><p>on through the inky, whispering waters. </p><p> Treach was nearly mad now. There</p><p>was something out there! He could no </p><p>longer keep from thinking of the curse </p><p>—of what Ynez had said about not be- </p><p>ing able to die. Yet he had killed her; </p><p>what he did would kill anyone. She </p><p>must be dead. </p><p> “What’s that?” Groat had stopped</p><p>rowing. </p><p> “Where?”</p><p> “Back there in the water — see,</p><p>where the moonlight hits the wave.” </p><p> “I don’t see-” Treach stopped,</p><p>eyes wide with dread. </p><p> “Yes, you do. You see it. That head,</p><p>coming toward us.” </p><p> They sat there while the bobbing</p><p>thing approached. And the whisper- </p><p>ing rose about them in a great mur- </p><p>mur as of winds rising from ocean </p><p>depths, and the whispering was clear </p><p>this time so that they heard. . </p><p> “IFhere are you, Luke Treach? I</p><p>come for you. You have taken my eyes, </p><p>Luke Treach, and I cannot see. But </p><p>you are there, and I come for you” </p><p>Groat began to laugh. A low </p><p>chuckling rose from his throat until it </p><p>drowned out the sound of the whisper- </p><p>ing. Groat raised his head to the moon </p><p>and bayed his laughter. Lie sat there</p><p>quaking with mirth. </p><p> And Treach watched him, then</p><p>watched the bobbing head that circled </p><p>96 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>the boat. It went around once, twice. </p><p>It stopped for a moment on his side, </p><p>and he saw a dark, seal-like outline </p><p>that might or might not have been hu- </p><p>man. It hesitated in the water, and </p><p>Treach drew his knife. Then it circled </p><p>the boat again and came to rest on the </p><p>side where Groat sat laughing. Two </p><p>arms rose out of the water in the moon- </p><p>light—two red arms, glistening and </p><p>wet. And Groat went over, still laugh- </p><p>ing. His laughter rose, then bubbled </p><p>away as the arms dragged him down. </p><p> It was then that Treach himself be-</p><p>gan to laugh. All alone in the boat he </p><p>sat, laughing up to the moon. He </p><p>laughed because he knew he was mad </p><p>—what he had seen could not be true. </p><p> He was mad, and yet he would es-</p><p>cape. Luke Treach seized an oar and </p><p>began to row with demented fury. </p><p>rpiiE sun was high when he ceased. </p><p>-^-■Madness passed, and the events of </p><p>the night were a dream. Treach leaned </p><p>back, rubbed his eyes, and looked </p><p>around in amazement. </p><p> “Groat? Salvatore? Slew? Where</p><p>are you?” </p><p> They were gone—but they couldn’t</p><p>be gone, or it would be true. </p><p> “Groat? Salvatore? Slew?”</p><p> And then the waves around the boat</p><p>parted, and three heads appeared in </p><p>the water. Sam Slew’s one-eyed stare </p><p>came from a blue, bloated face. Sal- </p><p>vatore’s eyes were closed and his </p><p>mouth was sealed with seaweed. The </p><p>drowned visage of Groat, smiling </p><p>through a tangle of kelp, bobbed hor- </p><p>ridly on the waves. All three heads </p><p>came to the side of the boat. They </p><p>shimmered there through the haze of </p><p>heat from the sun. </p><p> Treach had been screaming for a</p><p>long time in a high shrill voice when </p><p>they disappeared.</p><p> “Fever,” he muttered. “Just one</p><p>day more.” </p><p> He clawed at the oars.</p><p> But now he couldn’t keep his eyes off</p><p>the water. And as noon approached, he </p><p>could begin to see the swimmer behind </p><p>—far off, crawling through the trough </p><p>of the waves. It was keeping distance; </p><p>but a few strokes and it would be upon </p><p>him. </p><p> The delirious pirate redoubled his</p><p>efforts with every ounce of remaining </p><p>strength. And still the gap between </p><p>boat and swimmer narrowed. Now </p><p>Treach could see long red arms in the </p><p>water. Lie could not quite make out </p><p>a head or face, but he saw the arms. </p><p>Remembering what he had done he </p><p>shuddered. Red arms! </p><p> But the breeze was changing. Off-</p><p>shore ? </p><p> He faced the sunset. A black bulk</p><p>loomed from the water to his west. </p><p>Dominica, he guessed. If he could </p><p>make it before nightfall he would be </p><p>safe. </p><p> He rowed on, faster.</p><p> The swimmer was fast, too. The</p><p>gap narrowed, just as the red band of </p><p>sunset narrowed. </p><p> “How can she follow?” Treach mut-</p><p>tered. “She’s blind. I know that. She </p><p>took the others, searching for me. How </p><p>can she follow? Wizard tricks—that </p><p>vial! Why didn’t I believe it would </p><p>keep her alive, even after that! I must </p><p>row—harder.” </p><p> Panting, the wrecked body of Luke</p><p>Treach tugged at the oars. His blood- </p><p>shot eyes stared now at the bobbing </p><p>head just behind the boat. His ears </p><p>buzzed, but he heard the whisperings. </p><p> 111 swore it, Luke Treach. Now I</p><p>come for you ” </p><p> There was no use to row, but Treach</p><p>rowed; no use to scream, but Treach</p><p>screamed; screamed and rowed as the </p><p>THE RED SWIMMER </p><p>97 </p><p>red thing swam around the boat. Then </p><p>it was crawling over the side, and Luke </p><p>Treach avoided the pinkish-red arms as </p><p>they reached out. Laughing, he drew </p><p>his knife. But then it crawled into the </p><p>boat so that Treach saw it, drowned, </p><p>yet livid red all over. And he pointed </p><p>the knife, but it came on, eyeless and </p><p>groping. One hand grasped the knife </p><p>and then both arms went around Luke </p><p>Treach so that he fell back. The hand </p><p>grasping the knife came down and a </p><p>voice that was not a voice whispered: </p><p>111 came a long way—from death </p><p>itself.

The tab- </p><p>loids ran flaming headlines tell- </p><p>ing of the mysterious mutilation and </p><p>death of Kenneth Scott, noted Balti- </p><p>more author and occultist, and later, </p><p>they capitalized similarly on the disap- </p><p>pearance of Robert Ludwig, whose cor- </p><p>respondence with Scott was well known </p><p>in literary circles. The equally strange </p><p>and even more ghastly death of Paul </p><p>Edmond, while separated from the </p><p>scene of the Scott horror by the width </p><p>of a continent, was clearly connected </p><p>with it. This was shown by the pres- </p><p>ence of a certain much-discussed object </p><p>which was found clutched in Edmond’s </p><p>rigid hands—and which the credulous </p><p>claim caused his death. While this so- </p><p>lution is improbable, it is nevertheless </p><p>true that Paul Edmond bled to death </p><p>because his carotid artery was severed, </p><p>and it is also true that there are </p><p>features about the case difficult to ex- </p><p>plain in the light of present-day science. </p><p> The tabloids made a great deal of</p><p>Edmond’s diary, and even conventional </p><p>papers found it difficult to handle that </p><p>unusual document in a fashion that </p><p>would not lay them open to the charge </p><p>of yellow journalism. The Hollywood </p><p>Citizen-News solved the problem for </p><p>its contemporaries by quoting the least </p><p>fantastic portions of the diary, and </p><p>hinting plainly that Edmond had been a </p><p>fiction writer, and that the man’s notes </p><p>had never been intended as a truthful </p><p>summary of events. The privately </p><p>printed pamphlet, On the Sending Out</p><p>of the Soul, which played so important </p><p>a part in the diary, seems to be of </p><p>purely fictional origin. None of the </p><p>local booksellers has heard of it, and </p><p>Mr. Russell Hodgkins, California’s </p><p>most noted bibliophile, declares that </p><p>the title and the volume must have </p><p>originated in the mind of the ill-fated </p><p>Paul Edmond. </p><p> Yet, according to Edmond’s diary</p><p>and certain other papers and letters </p><p>discovered in his desk, it was this pam- </p><p>phlet which caused Ludwig and Ed- </p><p>mond to undertake the disastrous ex- </p><p>periment. Ludwig had decided to visit </p><p>his California correspondent, making a </p><p>leisurely voyage from New York by </p><p>way of the Panama Canal. The Car- </p><p>natic docked on August 15th, and Lud- </p><p>wig spent several hours wandering- </p><p>through San Pedro. It was there, in a </p><p>musty “swap shop,” that he bought the </p><p>pamphlet, On the Sending Out of the </p><p>Soul. When the young man arrived at </p><p> 99</p><p>100 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>Edmond’s Hollywood apartment he </p><p>had the booklet with him. </p><p> Both Ludwig and Edmond were</p><p>deeply interested in the occult. They </p><p>had dabbled in witchcraft and demon- </p><p>ology, as a result of their acquaintance </p><p>with Scott, who possessed one of the </p><p>best occult libraries in America. </p><p> Scott was a strange man. Slender,</p><p>sharp-eyed, and taciturn, he spent most </p><p>of his time in an old brownstone house </p><p>in Baltimore. His knowledge of eso- </p><p>teric matters was little short of phe- </p><p>nomenal; he had read the Chhaya Rit- </p><p>ual, and in his letters to Ludwig and </p><p>Edmond had hinted at the real mean- </p><p>ings behind the veiled hints and warn- </p><p>ings in that half-legendary manuscript. </p><p>In his great library were such names </p><p>as Sinistra-:i, Zancherius, and the ill- </p><p>famed Gougenot des Mousseau; and in </p><p>his library safe he had, it was rumored, </p><p>an immense scrapbook filled with ex- </p><p>cerpts copied from such fantastic </p><p>sources as the Book of Karnak, the </p><p>monstrous Sixtystone, and the blas- </p><p>phemous Elder Key, of which only two </p><p>copies are reputed to exist on earth. </p><p> It was little wonder, therefore, that</p><p>the two students were anxious to tear </p><p>aside the veil and view the astounding </p><p>mysteries of which Scott hinted so cau- </p><p>tiously. In his diary Edmond confessed </p><p>that his own curiosity was the direct </p><p>cause of the tragedy. </p><p> Yet it was Ludwig who bought the</p><p>booklet and pored over it with Edmond </p><p>in the latter’s apartment. Certainly </p><p>Edmond described the pamphlet plainly </p><p>enough, and it is strange, therefore, </p><p>that no bibliophile could identify it. Ac- </p><p>cording to the diary, it was quite small, </p><p>about four by five inches, bound in </p><p>coarse brown paper, and yellowed and </p><p>crumbling with age. The printing—in </p><p>Eighteenth Century type with the long </p><p>.v—was crudely done, and there was </p><p>neither a date-line nor a publisher’s im- </p><p>print. There were eight pages; seven </p><p>of them filled with what Edmond called</p><p>the usual banal sophisms of mysticism, </p><p>and on the last page were the specific </p><p>directions for what would nowadays be </p><p>known as “projecting one’s astral.” </p><p> The general process was familiar to</p><p>both students. Their researches had </p><p>informed them that the soul—or in </p><p>modern occult language, “astral body” </p><p>—is supposed to be an ethereal double </p><p>or ghost, capable of projection to a di-s- </p><p>tance. But the specific directions— </p><p>finding these was unusual. Nor did they </p><p>seem difficult to follow. Edmond has </p><p>purposely been vague about these prep- </p><p>arations, but one gathers that the two </p><p>students visited several chemists be- </p><p>fore obtaining the ingredients needed. </p><p>Where they secured the cannabis indica </p><p>later discovered on the scene of the </p><p>tragedy is a mystery, but not, of course, </p><p>one impossible of solution. </p><p> On August 15th Ludwig, apparently</p><p>without Edmond’s knowledge, wrote to </p><p>Scott by air-mail, describing the pam- </p><p>phlet and its contents, and asking for </p><p>advice. </p><p> On the night of August 18th, ap-</p><p>proximately half an hour after Kenneth </p><p>Scott received Ludwig’s letter, the two </p><p>young occultists undertook their disas- </p><p>trous experiment. </p><p>2 </p><p>T ater, Edmond blamed himself. In </p><p>the diary he mentions Ludwig’s un- </p><p>easiness, as though the latter sensed </p><p>some hidden danger. Ludwig suggested </p><p>postponing the trial for a few days, but </p><p>Edmond laughed at his fears. It ended </p><p>with the two placing the required in- </p><p>gredients in a brazier and kindling the </p><p>mixture. </p><p> There were other preparations, too,</p><p>HYDRA </p><p>101 </p><p>but Edmond is quite vague. He makes </p><p>one or two furtive references to “the </p><p>seven lamps” and “the infra color,” but </p><p>nothing can be made of these terms. </p><p>The two had decided to attempt pro- </p><p>jection of their astral bodies across the </p><p>continent; they would attempt com- </p><p>munication with Kenneth Scott. One </p><p>can detect a tinge of youthful vanity </p><p>in this. </p><p> Cannabis indica formed one of the</p><p>ingredients of the mixture in the bra- </p><p>zier; that has been ascertained by </p><p>analysis. It was the presence of this </p><p>Indian drug which led so many to be- </p><p>lieve that the later entries in Edmond’s </p><p>diary were evolved from nothing more </p><p>tangible than the fantasies of an opium </p><p>or hashish dream, directed along the </p><p>curious channels they took merely be- </p><p>cause of the students’ preoccupation </p><p>with those things at the time. Ed- </p><p>mond dreamed he saw Scott’s house in </p><p>Baltimore. But it must be remembered </p><p>that he had been staring at a photo- </p><p>graph of that house which he had </p><p>placed on the table before him; and he </p><p>was consciously willing to go there. </p><p>Nothing is more logical therefore, </p><p>than that Edmond simply dreamed </p><p>what he wanted to dream. </p><p> But Ludwig had the identical vision,</p><p>or, at least, so he stated afterward— </p><p>unless Edmond, in that entry, lied. It </p><p>is the opinion of Professor Perry L. </p><p>Lewis, a recognized expert on dream- </p><p>phenomena, that Edmond, during his </p><p>hashish vision, spoke of his illusions </p><p>aloud, with no conscious intention of so </p><p>doing, nor any later memory of it— </p><p>and that Ludwig, as in a hypnotic </p><p>trance, simply saw the phantasms Ed- </p><p>mond’s words conjured up in his mind. </p><p> Edmond states in his diary that after</p><p>watching the burning contents of the </p><p>brazier for some minutes, he fell into </p><p>a state of somnolent trance, in which </p><p>he saw his surroundings clearly, but </p><p>with certain curious alterations which </p><p>can only be attributed to the action of </p><p>the drug. The marijuana smoker may</p><p>see a tiny hall bedroom metamorphose </p><p>itself into a huge vaulted chamber; </p><p>similarly, Edmond stated that the room </p><p>in which he sat seemed to enlarge. </p><p>Oddly, however, the growth was of a </p><p>strangely abnormal type; the geometry </p><p>of the room gradually became all </p><p>wrong. Edmond stresses this point </p><p>without attempting to explain it. Just </p><p>when the shifting became noticeable he </p><p>does not mention, but presently he </p><p>found himself in the midst of a cham- </p><p>ber which, although recognizably his </p><p>own, had changed until it centered at a </p><p>certain point. </p><p> The notes are almost incoherent</p><p>here. Edmond obviously found it diffi- </p><p>cult to describe what he saw in his </p><p>vision. All the lines and curves of the </p><p>room, he insists with odd emphasis, </p><p>seemed to point at one specific spot, the </p><p>brazier where the mixture of drugs and </p><p>chemicals was smoldering. </p><p> Very faindy a persistent ringing</p><p>came to his ears, but this dwindled and </p><p>at last died away altogether. At the </p><p>time Edmond thought the sound due to </p><p>the effects of the drug. It was not until </p><p>later that he learned of Scott’s frantic </p><p>efforts to reach him by means of long- </p><p>distance telephone. The shrill ringing </p><p>grew fainter and faded into silence. </p><p> Edmond was of an experimental turn</p><p>of mind. He tried to shift his gaze to </p><p>specific objects he remembered, a vase, </p><p>a lamp, a table. But the room seemed </p><p>to possess an indescribable viscid fluid- </p><p>ity, so that he found his stare inevitably </p><p>slipping along warped lines and curves </p><p>until he was again watching the bra- </p><p>zier. And it was then that he became </p><p>conscious of something unusual taking </p><p>place at that spot. </p><p>.102 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> The mixture no longer smoldered.</p><p>Instead, a strange crystal formation </p><p>was building itself up within the bra- </p><p>zier. This object Edmond found im- </p><p>possible to describe; he could only say </p><p>that it seemed a continuation of the </p><p>warped lines of the room, carrying </p><p>them beyond the point where they cen- </p><p>tered. Apparently unconscious of the </p><p>insanity of such a concept, he goes on </p><p>to say that his eyes began to ache as he </p><p>watched the crystalline object, but he </p><p>could not turn away his gaze. </p><p> The crystal drew him. Lie felt an</p><p>abrupt and agonizing suction; there </p><p>was a high-pitched thrumming in the </p><p>air, and suddenly he was drifting with </p><p>increasing velocity toward the thing in </p><p>the brazier. It sucked him in—such </p><p>is Edmond’s inexplicable phrase; he </p><p>felt a moment of incredible cold, and </p><p>then a new vision rose up before him. </p><p> RAY fog, and instability. Edmond</p><p>^ stressed this curious feeling of </p><p>flux, which he declared existed within </p><p>himself. He felt, he says oddly, like </p><p>a cloud of smoke, wavering and drift- </p><p>ing aimlessly. But when he glanced </p><p>down he saw his own body, fully clothed </p><p>and apparently quite substantial. </p><p> Now a dreadful feeling of uneasi-</p><p>ness began to oppress his mind. The </p><p>fog thickened and whirled; the night- </p><p>mare, causeless fear familiar to the </p><p>opium-taker clutched him in its grip. </p><p>Something, he felt, was approaching, </p><p>something utterly horrible and fright- </p><p>ful in its potent menace. Then, quite </p><p>suddenly, the fog was gone. </p><p> Far beneath him he saw what at first</p><p>he took to be the sea. He was hanging </p><p>unsupported in empty air, and a surg- </p><p>ing grayness shimmered and crawled </p><p>from horizon to horizon. The fluctu- </p><p>ating leaden surface was dotted and </p><p>speckled with round dark blobsj these </p><p>were innumerable. Without conscious </p><p>volition .he felt himself drawn down </p><p>vertically, and as he approached the </p><p>mysterious grayness he saw it more</p><p>clearly. </p><p> Lie could not determine its nature. It</p><p>seemed merely a sea of gray slime, </p><p>protoplasmic and featureless. But the </p><p>dark blobs became recognizable as </p><p>heads. </p><p> Into Edmond’s mind flashed the</p><p>memory of a narrative he had once </p><p>read, written in the Twelfth Century </p><p>by the monk Alberico, and purporting </p><p>to be the record of a descent into hell. </p><p>Like Dante, Alberico had seen the tor- </p><p>ments of the damned; the blasphemers </p><p>(he wrote in his stilted, pedantic Latin) </p><p>had been immersed to their necks in a </p><p>lake of molten metal. Edmond remem- </p><p>bered Alberico’s description now. Then </p><p>he saw that the heads were not those </p><p>of beings partly submerged in the gray </p><p>slime; instead, they were homogenous </p><p>with the grayness. They grew from it! </p><p> Edmond’s fear had left him. With</p><p>oddly detached curiosity he scanned </p><p>the fantastic surface below. There </p><p>were human heads bobbing and nod- </p><p>ding from the gray sea, uncountable </p><p>thousands of them, but by far the </p><p>greater number of the heads were not </p><p>human. Some of these latter bore traces </p><p>of the anthropoid, but others were </p><p>scarcely recognizable as living objects. </p><p> For the heads lived. Their eyes</p><p>stared with awful agony; their lips </p><p>writhed in soundless laments; tears </p><p>coursed down the sunken cheeks of </p><p>many. Even the horribly inhuman </p><p>heads—bird-like, reptilian, monstrous </p><p>things of living stone and metal and </p><p>vegetable matter—showed traces of </p><p>the unceasing torment that gnawed at </p><p>them. Down toward the ghastly horde </p><p>Edmond was drawn. </p><p> Again blackness enveloped him. It</p><p>HYDRA </p><p>103 </p><p>was transitory, but as he emerged from </p><p>momentary unconsciousness he felt (he </p><p>says) curiously changed. Something </p><p>had happened to him during that fate- </p><p>ful period of darkness. There seemed </p><p>to be a cloudy vagueness shadowing his </p><p>mind, so that he viewed his surround- </p><p>ings darkly and through a kind of haze. </p><p>In this new vision he seemed to be high </p><p>in the air above a silent, moonlit city, </p><p>and rapidly moving downward. </p><p> There was a full moon, and by its</p><p>light he recognized the old brownstone </p><p>house toward which he was descend- </p><p>ing. It was Kenneth Scott’s home, </p><p>made familiar to him by the photo- </p><p>graph. A vague thrill of triumph </p><p>warmed him; the experiment, then, had </p><p>succeeded. </p><p> The house loomed up before him.</p><p>He was hovering outside an open, </p><p>unlighted window. Peering in, he rec- </p><p>ognized the slender form of Kenneth </p><p>Scott seated at a desk. The occultist’s </p><p>lips were tightly compressed, and a </p><p>worried scowl darkened his face. A </p><p>great book with yellowed parchment </p><p>pages was open before the man, who </p><p>was studying it carefully. Occasion- </p><p>ally his worried eyes would turn to the </p><p>telephone on the desk beside him. Ed- </p><p>mond made an attempt to call to Scott, </p><p>and the latter looked up, staring </p><p>through the window. </p><p> Instantly a shocking change trans-</p><p>formed Scott’s face. The man seemed </p><p>to become quite insane with fear. He </p><p>sprang up from the desk, overturning </p><p>his chair, and simultaneously Edmond </p><p>felt an impelling urge dragging him </p><p>forward. </p><p>TTThat happened after that is con- </p><p>’ ’ fused and hazy. Edmond’s notes </p><p>are fragmentary at this point, and it is </p><p>only possible to gather that Edmond </p><p>was in the room and pursuing the fran- </p><p>tic Scott in a fashion that was inex- </p><p>plicable and utterly abnormal. He was </p><p>flowing—and Scott was caught and en- </p><p>gulfed — and here Edmond’s notes</p><p>break off utterly, as though he had been </p><p>overcome by remembrance of the epi- </p><p>sode. </p><p> Merciful blackness swallowed Ed-</p><p>mond then, but there was one more </p><p>flashing vision before the dream faded </p><p>and was gone. Again he seemed to be </p><p>outside Scott’s window, swiftly retreat- </p><p>ing into the night, and through the open </p><p>square of yellow radiance was visible </p><p>part of Scott’s desk and the crumpled </p><p>body of the man himself lying on the </p><p>carpet beyond it. At least Edmond as- </p><p>sumed that it was Scott’s body, for </p><p>either the man was lying with his head </p><p>doubled at an impossible angle out of </p><p>sight beneath his torso, or else he was </p><p>headless. </p><p> That ended the dream. Edmond</p><p>awoke to find the room in darkness, and </p><p>Ludwig stirring sleepily near by. Both </p><p>students were distracted and over- </p><p>wrought. They argued excitedly for </p><p>some time, with occasional semi-hyster- </p><p>ical outbursts, and Ludwig revealed </p><p>that his vision had been identical with </p><p>Edmond’s. It is a pity that neither of </p><p>them took the trouble to analyze the </p><p>situation and look for a logical expla- </p><p>nation, but both, of course, were mys- </p><p>tics, and thoroughly credulous. </p><p> The telephone rang. An impatient</p><p>operator asked if Edmond would re- </p><p>ceive a call from Baltimore. She had, </p><p>she said, been ringing the apartment </p><p>for some time without getting a re- </p><p>sponse. Edmond cut her off abruptly </p><p>and requested that the connection be </p><p>put through. But this could not be </p><p>done. The operator at the Baltimore </p><p>exchange reported that her party did </p><p>not answer, and, after a futile exchange </p><p>of questions, Edmond hung up. It was </p><p>104 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>then Ludwig confessed to writing Scott, </p><p>bemoaning the reticence that had made </p><p>him refrain from telling the Baltimore </p><p>occultist the purpose of the experiment </p><p>—the destination to which the astrals </p><p>were directed. </p><p> Nor were their fears calmed by the</p><p>discovery of the object in the brazier. </p><p>Apparently part of the vision at least </p><p>had been founded on truth; the un- </p><p>known chemicals had crystallized into </p><p>a thing that appeared to be all planes </p><p>and angles. It was formed of some </p><p>brittle substance resembling frosted </p><p>glass, was roughly pyramidal, and </p><p>measured about six inches from apex to </p><p>base. Ludwig wanted to smash it at </p><p>once, but Edmond prevented him. </p><p> Their arguments were brought to an</p><p>end by the arrival of a telegram from </p><p>Scott. It read: </p><p> ATTEMPT NO EXPERIMENTS WITH</p><p>PAMPHLET YOU MENTION STOP TRE- </p><p>MENDOUSLY DANGEROUS AND MAY </p><p>MEAN MY DEATH STOP AM WRITING </p><p>YOU TODAY BY AIR MAIL FULL DETAILS </p><p>STOP ADVISE YOU BURN PAMPHLET </p><p>KENNETH SCOTT </p><p>3 </p><p>rpHERE were two more communica- </p><p> tions which resulted in Paul Ed-</p><p>mond’s temporary stay at a Hollywood </p><p>hospital. The first was an item which </p><p>appeared in time for the morning edi- </p><p>tion of the Los Angeles Times of </p><p>August 20th. It stated briefly that </p><p>Kenneth Scott, well-known author and </p><p>occultist, residing in Baltimore, Mary- </p><p>land, had been mysteriously murdered. </p><p>There were no clues to indicate the </p><p>identity of the assailant, and the body </p><p>had not been discovered until the after- </p><p>noon of the 19th. The fact that the </p><p>victim’s head had been severed from </p><p>his body and was inexplicably missing </p><p>made identification at first doubtful, </p><p>but Scott’s physician confirmed the log- </p><p>ical supposition. A quantity of gray-</p><p>ish slime smeared on the carpet added </p><p>another element of mystery to the case. </p><p>Scott’s head, the coroner declared, had </p><p>been cleanly severed from his body by </p><p>a sharp blade. Police stated that an </p><p>arrest would be made shortly. </p><p> Needless to say, that arrest was</p><p>never made. The tabloids seized the </p><p>juicy morsel and made much of it, and </p><p>an enterprising reporter unearthed the </p><p>fact that Scott had sent an air-mail let- </p><p>ter from the Baltimore Central post </p><p>office shortly before the time at which </p><p>his death had been fixed. It was this </p><p>communication which was the direct </p><p>cause of Edmond’s nervous collapse </p><p>and his retirement to a hospital. </p><p> The letter was found in Edmond’s</p><p>apartment, but it sheds little light on </p><p>the case. Scott was a visionary, and his </p><p>letter bears an almost suspicious re- </p><p>semblance to his fictional work. </p><p> “Both of you know” (ran part of</p><p>the long letter) “how much truth there </p><p>is often to be found behind old legends </p><p>and folk-lore. The Cyclops is no longer </p><p>a myth, as any doctor familiar with </p><p>monstrous births can tell you. And you </p><p>know how my theories regarding the </p><p>Elixir Vita? have been confirmed by </p><p>the discovery of heavy water. Well, </p><p>the myth of the Hydra is based on </p><p>such a truth. </p><p> “There are innumerable tales of</p><p>multi-headed monsters, all springing </p><p>from the actual entity of whose real </p><p>existence a very few have known </p><p>through the ages. This creature did not </p><p>originate on earth, but in the gulfs Out- </p><p>side. It was, after a fashion, a vam- </p><p>piric entity, living not on the blood of </p><p>its victims but on their heads—rheir </p><p>brains. This may sound strange to </p><p>you, but you know by this time that </p><p>there are beings Outside whose needs </p><p>HYDRA </p><p>105 </p><p>and flesh are not as ours. Through </p><p>the eons this entity has ravened in the </p><p>abyss beyond our dimension, sending </p><p>out its call to claim victims where it </p><p>could. For this entity, by absorbing the </p><p>heads and brains of intelligent creatures </p><p>both of this world and of other planets, </p><p>emerges with its powers and vitality </p><p>greatly augmented. </p><p> “You both know that through the</p><p>ages there have been certain people </p><p>willing to worship the Great Ones— </p><p>even the evil Aliens who have come </p><p>down to us in folk-lore as demons. </p><p>Every god and every entity has had its </p><p>worshippers, from black Pharol to the </p><p>least of the Aliens whose powers are </p><p>more than human. And these cults in- </p><p>termingle in a very curious way, so that </p><p>we find traces of a forgotten worship </p><p>cropping up in far later times. When </p><p>the Romans worshipped the Magna </p><p>Mater in Italy’s dark forests, for in- </p><p>stance, why do you suppose they incor- </p><p>porated into their ritual the mystic </p><p>adoration, ‘Gorgo, Mormo, thousand- </p><p>faced moon’? The implication is clear. </p><p> “I have gone into considerable de-</p><p>tail, but it has been necessary to pre- </p><p>pare you for my explanation of the </p><p>origin of that pamphlet Robert found </p><p>in San Pedro. I knew of this booklet, </p><p>which was printed in Salem in 1783, </p><p>but I had thought that there were no </p><p>longer any copies in existence. That </p><p>pamphlet is a trap, and a most damna- </p><p>ble one, created by the worshippers of </p><p>the Hydra to lure victims into the maw </p><p>of their god! </p><p> “It purports to be merely an inno-</p><p>cent experiment with the astral self. </p><p>However, the real purpose of the thing </p><p>is to open a gateway and prepare a </p><p>sacrifice for the Hydra. When the </p><p>booklets were first distributed, through </p><p>secret underground channels, there was </p><p>an epidemic of deaths in New England. </p><p>Dozens of men and women were found </p><p>headless, with no trace of any human </p><p>murderer. Yet the real killers were </p><p>the ones who performed the experiment</p><p>according to the directions given in the </p><p>booklet, and unknowingly let the </p><p>Hydra use their vital forces to ma- </p><p>terialize on this planet. </p><p> “Baldly speaking, what happens is</p><p>this: the subject, following the instruc- </p><p>tions, inhales the fumes of the drug </p><p>which tears apart the veil between our </p><p>world and Outside. He concentrates </p><p>upon the person whom he wishes his </p><p>astral to visit, and that person is </p><p>doomed. For the experimenter is </p><p>drawn Outside, into another dimension </p><p>of space, and through a certain psychic </p><p>and chemical process is temporarily </p><p>made one with the Hydra. What it </p><p>amounts to is this: the Hydra, using </p><p>the experimenter’s astral as a host, </p><p>comes to earth and takes its prey— </p><p>which is the person upon whom the </p><p>subject has been concentrating. There </p><p>is no real danger to the experimenter </p><p>himself, save, perhaps, for a possible </p><p>severe nervous shock. But the other— </p><p>the victim—is taken by the Flydra for </p><p>its own. He is doomed to eternal tor- </p><p>ment, except in certain unusual cases </p><p>where he can maintain a psychic link </p><p>with an earthly mind. But I need not </p><p>speak of that. </p><p> “I am greatly worried. I have put</p><p>through a long-distance call to Ed- </p><p>mond’s apartment, and no doubt you </p><p>will hear from me tonight long before </p><p>this letter can arrive. If you are rash </p><p>enough to undertake the experiment be- </p><p>fore I can communicate with you, I </p><p>shall be in grave danger, for you may </p><p>attempt projection of your astral to </p><p>Baltimore, to me. After I have posted </p><p>this letter, and while I am waiting for </p><p>my telephone call to be put through, I </p><p>shall do my utmost to find a protective </p><p>106 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>formula, although I do not think one </p><p>exists. </p><p>“Kenneth Scott.” </p><p>Tt WAS this letter which sent Edmond </p><p> to the hospital for a few days to</p><p>recover from his nervous condition. </p><p>Ludwig was apparently of stronger </p><p>stuff; he stayed, at Edmond’s request, </p><p>in the latter’s apartment, and indulged </p><p>in some experimenting of his own. </p><p> Just what happened in Edmond’s</p><p>apartment during the next few days will </p><p>never be fully known. Ludwig visited </p><p>his host daily at the hospital, and told </p><p>him of his experiments, and Edmond </p><p>noted what he could remember on slips </p><p>of paper which he subsequently inserted </p><p>between pages of his diary. One is in- </p><p>clined to believe that the anomalous </p><p>mixture of drugs in the brazier contin- </p><p>ued to exert its influence on the minds </p><p>of the two students, for certainly Lud- </p><p>wig’s experiences, as recorded by Ed- </p><p>mond, seem like a continuation of the </p><p>original hashish dream. </p><p> Ludwig had burned the pamphlet,</p><p>as might be expected. And then, on </p><p>the night following Edmond’s removal </p><p>to the hospital, the other youth main- </p><p>tained, he had heard Scott speaking </p><p>to him. </p><p> Edmond did not scoff, for he was</p><p>vastly credulous. He listened intently </p><p>while Ludwig declared that the occult- </p><p>ist was still alive, although existing in </p><p>another dimension of space. The </p><p>Llydra had captured Scott, but the oc- </p><p>cultist had the power to communicate </p><p>with Ludwig. It is necessary to keep </p><p>constantly in mind the fact that neither </p><p>of these two youths was quite normal </p><p>after the mental agitation he had un- </p><p>dergone. </p><p> So Ludwig added more and more</p><p>every day to his tale, and Edmond lis- </p><p>tened. They spoke furtively, in whis- </p><p>pers, and Edmond kept careful watch</p><p>over his notes so that they would not </p><p>fall into skeptical hands. The whole </p><p>crux of the matter, Ludwig said, was </p><p>the strange crystalline object which had </p><p>formed' in the brazier. It was this </p><p>which kept open the path to Outside. </p><p>One could pass through it if one </p><p>wished, despite the fact that it was not </p><p>as large as a man’s head, because the </p><p>crystal created a “warp in space”—a </p><p>term Edmond mentions several times, </p><p>but entirely neglects to explain. The </p><p>Hydra, however, could not return to </p><p>earth unless the original conditions </p><p>were duplicated. </p><p> Ludwig said he had heard Scott’s</p><p>voice whispering thinly from the crys- </p><p>talline thing of insane planes and </p><p>angles, and the occultist was in horrible </p><p>agony and insistent that Ludwig rescue </p><p>him. It would not be difficult, pro- </p><p>vided the student followed instructions </p><p>implicidy. There were dangers, but he </p><p>must have courage, obey, and strive to </p><p>undo the harm he had done. Only thus </p><p>could Scott be freed from endless agony </p><p>and return to earth. </p><p> So, Ludwig told Edmond, he went</p><p>through the crystal—again this vague </p><p>and extraordinary phrase! — taking </p><p>those things Scott had said he would </p><p>need. Chief among these was a razor- </p><p>keen, bone-handled carving knife. </p><p>There were other objects, some of </p><p>them difficult to obtain, which Ludwig </p><p>did not specify, or which if he did, </p><p>Edmond did not mention in his notes. </p><p> According to Ludwig’s narrative, he</p><p>went through the crystal, and he found </p><p>Scott. But not at first. There were </p><p>nights of fumbling progress through </p><p>fantastic and terrible visions of night- </p><p>mare, guided always by the insistent </p><p>whisper of Scott’s voice. There were </p><p>gates to be passed, and strange dimen- </p><p>sions to traverse. And so Ludwig </p><p>HYDRA </p><p>107 </p><p>moved through awful abysses of puls- </p><p>ing, fearful darkness; he went through </p><p>a place of curious violet light that sent </p><p>tinkling, evil trills of goblin laughter </p><p>after him; he went through a Cyclo- </p><p>pean deserted city of ebon stone which </p><p>he shudderingly recognized a-s fabled </p><p>Dis. In the end he found Scott. </p><p>He did what was necessary. When </p><p>he came to the hospital the next </p><p>day Edmond was shocked by the blood- </p><p>less pallor of his friend, and the little </p><p>crawling lights of madness that shone </p><p>in his eyes. The pupils were unnatu- </p><p>rally dilated, and Ludwig spoke that </p><p>day in disjointed whispers which Ed- </p><p>mond found hard to follow. The notes </p><p>suffered. It is only clear that Ludwig </p><p>declared he had freed Scott from the </p><p>grip of the Hydra, and that over and </p><p>over again the youth kept muttering </p><p>something about the terrible gray slime </p><p>that had smeared the blade of his carv- </p><p>ing-knife. He said his task was not </p><p>yet ended. </p><p> Undoubtedly it was the drug-poi-</p><p>soned mind of Robert Ludwig speak- </p><p>ing when he told how he had left Scott, </p><p>or at least the living part of him, in a </p><p>plane of space which was not inimical </p><p>to human life, and which was not sub- </p><p>ject to entirely natural laws and proc- </p><p>esses. Scott wanted to return to earth. </p><p>He could return now, Ludwig told </p><p>Edmond, but the strange vitality that </p><p>maintained life in what was left of </p><p>Scott would dissipate immediately on </p><p>earth. Only in certain planes and di- </p><p>mensions was it possible for Scott to </p><p>exist at all, and the alien force that </p><p>kept him alive was gradually departing </p><p>now that he was no longer drawing </p><p>sustenance from the Hydra. Ludwig </p><p>said that quick action was necessary. </p><p> There was a certain spot Outside</p><p>where Scott could achieve his desire. </p><p>In that place thought was obscurely </p><p>linked to energy and matter, because </p><p>of an insane shrill piping (Ludwig </p><p>said) that eternally filtered from be- </p><p>yond a veil of flickering colors. It was</p><p>very near the Center, the Center of </p><p>Chaos, where dwells Azathoth, the </p><p>Lord of All Things. All that exists </p><p>was created by the thoughts of Aza- </p><p>thoth, and only in the Center of Ulti- </p><p>mate Chaos could Scott find means to </p><p>live again on earth in human form. </p><p>There is an erasure in Edmond’s notes </p><p>at this point, and it is only possible to </p><p>make out the fragment: .. of thought </p><p>made real ” </p><p> White-faced, hollow-cheeked, Lud-</p><p>wig said that he must complete his task. </p><p>He must take Scott to the Center, </p><p>although he confessed to a horrible </p><p>fear that made him hesitate. There </p><p>were dangers in the way, and pitfalls </p><p>where one might easily be trapped. </p><p>Worst of all, the veil shielding Aza- </p><p>thoth was thin, and even the slightest </p><p>glimpse of the Lord of All Things </p><p>would mean utter and complete de- </p><p>struction to the beholder. Scott had </p><p>spoken of that, Ludwig said, and had </p><p>also mentioned the dreadful lure that </p><p>would drag the young student’s eyes to </p><p>the fatal spot unless he fought strongly </p><p>against it. </p><p> Biting his lips nervously, Robert</p><p>Ludwig left the hospital, and.we as- </p><p>sume met with foul play on his way to </p><p>Edmond’s apartment. For Edmond </p><p>never saw his friend again on earth. </p><p>4 </p><p>The police were still searching for </p><p>the missing head of Kenneth Scott. </p><p>Edmond gathered that from the news- </p><p>papers. He waited impatiently the </p><p>next day for Ludwig to appear, and </p><p>after several hours had passed without </p><p>108 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>result, he telephoned his apartment and </p><p>got no response. Eventually, worried </p><p>and almost sick with anxiety, he spent </p><p>a turbulent ten minutes with his doctor </p><p>and another with the superintendent. </p><p>Finally he achieved his purpose and </p><p>went by taxi to hrs apartment, having </p><p>overruled the objection of hospital offi- </p><p>cials. </p><p> Ludwig was gone. He had vanished</p><p>without a trace. Edmond considered </p><p>summoning the police, but speedily dis- </p><p>missed the thought. He paced about </p><p>the apartment nervously, seldom turn- </p><p>ing his gaze from the crystalline ob- </p><p>ject that still rested in the brazier. </p><p> His diary gives little clue to wrhat</p><p>happened that night. One can conjec- </p><p>ture that he prepared another dose of </p><p>the narcotic drug, or that the toxic </p><p>effects of the fumes Edmond inhaled </p><p>several days before had finally worked </p><p>such disintegration within his brain that </p><p>he could no longer distinguish between </p><p>the false and the real. An entry in the </p><p>diary dated the following morning be- </p><p>gins abruptly, “I’ve heard him. Just as </p><p>Bob said, he spoke through the crystal </p><p>thing. Lie’s desperate, and tells me that </p><p>Bob failed. He didn’t get Scott to the </p><p>Center, or S. could have materialized </p><p>again on earth and rescued Bob. Some- </p><p>thing — I’m not sure what—caught </p><p>Bob, God help him. May God help </p><p>all of us. . . . Scott says I must begin </p><p>where Bob left off and finish the job.” </p><p> There is a soul laid bare on the last</p><p>pages of that record, and it is not a </p><p>pleasant sight. Somehow the most </p><p>frightful of the unearthly horrors the </p><p>diary describes seem not quite as dread- </p><p>ful as the last conflict that took place </p><p>in that apartment above Hollywood, </p><p>when a man wrestled with his fear and </p><p>realized his weakness. It is probably </p><p>just as well that the pamphlet was de- </p><p>stroyed, for such a brain-wrecking drug </p><p> as was described in it must surely have</p><p>originated in some hell as terrible as </p><p>any which Edmond portrays. The last </p><p>pages of the diary show a mind crum-</p><p>bling into ruin. </p><p> “I went through. Bob has made it</p><p>easier; I can begin where he left off, as </p><p>Scott says. And I w^ent up through the </p><p>Cold Flame and the Whirling Vortices </p><p>until I reached the place where Scott is. </p><p>Where he was, rather, for I picked him </p><p>up and carried him through several </p><p>planes before I had to return. Bob </p><p>didn’t mention the suction one'has to </p><p>keep fighting against. But it doesn’t </p><p>get very strong until I’ve got quite a </p><p>distance in.” </p><p>npHE next entry is dated a day later. It </p><p> is scarcely legible.</p><p> “Couldn’t stand it. Had to get out.</p><p>Walked around Griffith Park for </p><p>hours. Then I came back to the apart- </p><p>ment and almost immediately Scott </p><p>spoke to me. I’m afraid. I think he </p><p>senses that, and is frightened too, and </p><p>angry. </p><p> “He says we can’t waste any more</p><p>time. His vitality is almost gone, </p><p>and he’s got to reach the Center quick </p><p>and get back to earth. I saw Bob. Just </p><p>a glimpse, and I wouldn’t have known </p><p>it was he if Scott hadn’t told me. He </p><p>was all-awry, and horrible somehow. </p><p>Scott said the atoms of his body had </p><p>adapted themselves to another dimen- </p><p>sion when he let himself get caught. </p><p>I’ve got to be careful. We’re nearly at </p><p>the Center.” </p><p> The last entry.</p><p> “Once more will do it. God, I’m</p><p>afraid, horribly afraid. 1 heard the </p><p>piping. It turned my brain into ice. </p><p>Scott was shouting at me, urging me on, </p><p>and I think trying to drown that—other </p><p>sound, but of course he couldn’t do it. </p><p>There was a very faint violet glow in </p><p>HYDRA </p><p>109 </p><p>the distance, and a flickering of colored </p><p>lights. Beyond, Scott told me, was </p><p>Azathoth. </p><p> “1 can’t do it. I don’t dare—not</p><p>with that piping, and those Shapes </p><p>I saw moving far down. If I look </p><p>in that direction when I’m at the Veil </p><p>it will mean—but Scott is insanely </p><p>angry with me. He says I was the cause </p><p>of it all. I had an almost uncontroll- </p><p>able impulse to let the suction draw me </p><p>back, and then to smash the Gateway— </p><p>the crystal thing. Maybe if I find my- </p><p>self unable to keep looking away from </p><p>the Veil when next I go through I’ll do </p><p>just that. I told Scott if he let me come </p><p>back to earth for one more breathing- </p><p>space I’d finish the job this next time. </p><p>He agreed, but said to hurry. His </p><p>vitality is going fast. He said if I didn’t </p><p>come through the Gateway in ten min- </p><p>utes he’d come after me. He won’t, </p><p>though. The life that keeps him going </p><p>Outside wouldn’t be any use on earth, </p><p>except for a second or two. </p><p> “My ten minutes is up. Scott is call-</p><p>ing from the Gateway. I’m not going! </p><p>I can’t face it—not the last horror Out- </p><p>side, with those things moving behind </p><p>the Veil and that awful piping scream- </p><p>ing out- </p><p> “I won’t go, I tell you! No, Scott—•</p><p>I can’t face it! You can’t come out— </p><p>like that. You’d die—I tell you I won’t </p><p>go! You can’t force me—I’ll smash </p><p>the Gateway first! . . . what? No! </p><p>No, you can’t . . . you can’t do it! . . . </p><p>Scott! Don’t, don’t . . . God—'he’s </p><p>coming out-” </p><p> That was the last entry in the diary,</p><p>which police found open on Edmond’s </p><p>desk. A hideous screaming and subse- </p><p>quently a stream of red liquid seeping </p><p>out sluggishly from beneath the door of </p><p>Edmond’s apartment had resulted in </p><p>the arrival of two radio patrol officers. </p><p> The body of Paul Edmond was</p><p>found near the door, the head and </p><p>shoulders lying in a widening crimson</p><p>pool. </p><p> Near by was an overturned brass</p><p>brazier, and a flaky white substance, </p><p>granular in nature, was scattered over </p><p>the carpet. Edmond’s stiff fingers still </p><p>tightly gripped the object which has </p><p>since been the cause of so much dis- </p><p>cussion. </p><p> This object was in an incredible state</p><p>of preservation, in view of its nature. </p><p>Part of it was coated with a peculiar </p><p>grayish slime, and its jaws were </p><p>clamped tightly, the teeth having hor- </p><p>ribly mangled Edmond’s throat and </p><p>severed the carotid artery. </p><p> There was no need to search further</p><p>for the missing head of Kenneth Scott. </p><p>"It was a head, but living, as though its owner had been buried to his bearded chin.” </p><p>&lt;J earful Rock </p><p>By MANLY WADE WELLMAN </p><p>An eery tale of the American Civil War, and the uncanny evil being who </p><p>called himself Persil Mandifer, and his lovely daughter— </p><p>a tale of dark powers and weird happenings </p><p>The Story Thus Far	there by her stepfather, Persil Mandi-</p><p>SCENE, the Missouri-Arkansas	fer, as a sacrifice to the Nameless One</p><p>border, in Civil War times, with-	he worships.

Return of the Sacrifice</p><p>rTlHROUGH the cross-hatching of new- </p><p>leafed branches the full moon shone </p><p>down from its zenith. Lanark and Enid </p><p>Mandifer walked gingerly through the </p><p>night-filled timber in the gulley beyond </p><p>which, they knew, lay the ruins of the </p><p>house where so much repellent mystery </p><p>had been born. </p><p> “It’s just eleven o’clock,” whispered</p><p>Lanark, looking at his big silver watch. </p><p>Lie was dressed in white shirt and dark </p><p>trousers, without coat, hat or gloves. </p><p>Llis revolver rode in the front of his </p><p>waistband, and as he limped along, the </p><p>sheath of Jager’s old cavalry saber </p><p>thumped and rasped his left boot-top. </p><p>“We must be almost there.” </p><p> “We are there,” replied Enid.</p><p>“Here’s the clearing, and the little </p><p>brook of water.” </p><p> She was right. They had come to</p><p>the open space where first they had </p><p>met. The moonlight made the ground </p><p>and its new grass pallid, and struck </p><p>frosty-gold lights from the runlet in the </p><p>very center of the clearing. Beyond, to </p><p>the west, lay menacing shadows. </p><p> Enid stooped and laid upon the</p><p>ground the hand-mirror she carried, </p><p>“Stand to one side,” she said, “and </p><p>please don’t look.” </p><p> Lanark obeyed, and the girl began</p><p>to undress. </p><p> The young man felt dew at his mus-</p><p>tache, and a chill in his heart that was </p><p>not from dew. Lie stared into the </p><p>trees beyond the clearing, trying to </p><p>have faith in Jager’s plan. “We must </p><p>make the devils come forth and face </p><p>us,” the sergeant-preacher had argued. </p><p>“Miss Mandifer shall be our decoy, to </p><p>draw them out where we can get at </p><p>them. All is very strange, but this much </p><p>we know—the unholy worship did </p><p>go on; Miss Mandifer was to be sacri- </p><p>ficed as part of it; and, when the sacri- </p><p>fice was not completed, all these evil </p><p>things happened. We have the haunt- </p><p>ings, the blue fire of the house, the </p><p>creature that attacked Mr. Lanark, </p><p>and a host of other mysteries to credit </p><p>to these causes. Let us profit by what </p><p>little we have found out, and put an </p><p>112 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>end to the Devil’s rule in this country.” </p><p>It had all sounded logical, but La- </p><p>nark, listening, had been hesitant until </p><p>Enid herself agreed. Then it was that </p><p>Jager, strengthening his self-assumed </p><p>position of leadership, had made the </p><p>assignments. Enid would make the </p><p>journey, as before, from her house to </p><p>the gulley, there strip and say the </p><p>words with which her stepfather had </p><p>charged her four springs ago. Lanark, </p><p>armed, would accompany her as guard. </p><p>Jager himself would circle far to the </p><p>east and approach the ruins from the </p><p>opposite direction, observing, and, if </p><p>need be, attacking. </p><p> These preparations Lanark reviewed</p><p>mentally, while he heard Enid’s bare </p><p>feet splashing timidly in the water. It </p><p>came to him, a bit too late, that the </p><p>arms he bore might not avail against </p><p>supernatural enemies. Yet Jager had </p><p>seemed confident. . . . Enid was speak- </p><p>ing, apparently repeating the ritual that </p><p>was supposed to summon the unnamed </p><p>god-demon of Persil Mandifer: </p><p> “A maid, alone and pure, I stand,</p><p>not upon water nor on land; I hold a </p><p>mirror in my hand, in which to see what </p><p>Fate may send....” She broke off and </p><p>screamed. </p><p> Lanark whipped around. The girl</p><p>stood, misty-pale in the wash of moon- </p><p>light, all crouched and curved together </p><p>like a bow. </p><p> “It was coming!” she quavered. “I</p><p>saw it in the mirror—over yonder, </p><p>among those trees-” </p><p> Lanark glared across the little strip</p><p>of water and the moonlit grass beyond. </p><p>Ten paces away, between two trunks, </p><p>something shone in the shadows— </p><p>shone darkly, like tar, though the fil- </p><p>tered moon-rays did not touch it. He </p><p>saw nothing of the shape, save that it </p><p>moved and lived—and watched. </p><p> He drew his revolver and fired,</p><p>twice. There was a crash of twigs, as </p><p>though something had flinched back- </p><p>ward at the reports. </p><p> Lanark splashed through the water</p><p>and, despite his limp, charged at the </p><p>place where the presence lurked. </p><p>12.	Jager</p><p>Tt HAD been some minutes before </p><p>■*" eleven o’clock when Jager reined in </p><p>his old black horse at a distance of two </p><p>miles from Fearful Rock. </p><p> Most of those now alive who knew</p><p>Jager personally are apt to describe </p><p>him as he was when they were young </p><p>and he was old—a burly graybeard, a </p><p>notable preacher and exhorter, particu- </p><p>larly at funerals. He preferred the </p><p>New Testament to the Old, though he </p><p>was apt to misquote his texts from </p><p>either; and he loved children, and once </p><p>preached a telling sermon against the </p><p>proposition of infant damnation. His </p><p>tombstone, at Fort Smith, Arkansas, </p><p>bears as epitaph a verse from the third </p><p>chapter of the first book of Samuel: </p><p>Here am I, for thou didst call me. </p><p> Jager when young is harder to study</p><p>and to visualize. However, the diary </p><p>of a long-dead farmer’s wife of Penn- </p><p>sylvania records that the “Jager boy” </p><p>was dull but serious at school, and that </p><p>his appetite for mince pie amounted to </p><p>a passion. In Topeka, Kansas, lives </p><p>a retired railroad conductor whose </p><p>father, on the pre-Rebellion frontier, </p><p>once heard Jager defy Southern hood- </p><p>lums to shoot him for voting Free-state </p><p>in a territorial election. Ex-Major </p><p>Kane Lanark mentioned Jager fre- </p><p>quently and with admiration in the re- </p><p>markable pen-and-ink memoir on which </p><p>the present narrative is based. </p><p> How he approached Fearful Rock,</p><p>and what he encountered there, he him- </p><p>self often described .verbally to such of </p><p>FEARFUL ROCK </p><p>113 </p><p>his friends as pretended that they be- </p><p>lieved him. </p><p> The moonlight showed him a stunted</p><p>tree, with one gnarled root looping up </p><p>out of the earth, and to that root he </p><p>tethered his animal. Then, like La- </p><p>nark, he threw off his coat, strapping it </p><p>to the cantle of his saddle, and unfast- </p><p>ened his “hickory” blue shirt at the </p><p>throat. From a saddle-bag he drew a </p><p>trusty-looking revolver, its barrel </p><p>sawed off. Turning its butt toward the </p><p>moon, he spun the cylinder to make </p><p>sure that it was loaded. Then he </p><p>thrust it into his belt without benefit of </p><p>holster, and started on foot toward the </p><p>rock and its remains of a house. </p><p> Approaching, he sought by instinct</p><p>the cover of trees and bush-clumps, </p><p>moving smoothly and noiselessly; Jager </p><p>had been noted during his service in the </p><p>Army of the Frontier for his ability to </p><p>scout at night, an ability which he cred- </p><p>ited to the fact that he had been born </p><p>in the darkest hours. He made almost </p><p>as good progress as though he had been </p><p>moving in broad daylight. At eleven </p><p>o’clock sharp, as he guessed—like many </p><p>men who never carry watches, he had </p><p>become good at judging the time—he </p><p>was within two hundred yards of the </p><p>rock itself, and cover had run out. </p><p>There he paused, chin-deep in a clump </p><p>of early weeds. </p><p> Lanark and the girl, as he surmised,</p><p>must be well into the gulley by this </p><p>time. He, Jager, smiled as he remem- </p><p>bered with what alacrity Lanark had </p><p>accepted the assignment of bodyguard </p><p>to Enid Mandifer. Those two young </p><p>people acted as if they were on the </p><p>brink of falling in love, and no mis- </p><p>take. . . . </p><p> His eyes were making out details of</p><p>the scene ahead. Was even the full </p><p>moon so bright as all this? He could </p><p>not see very clearly the ruined founda- </p><p>tions, for they sat in a depression of </p><p>the earth. Yet there seemed to be a </p><p>clinging blue light at about that point,</p><p>a feeble but undeniable blue. Mentally </p><p>he compared it to deep, still water, </p><p>then to the poorest of skimmed milk. </p><p>Jager remembered the flames that once </p><p>had burned there, blue as amethyst. </p><p> But the blue light was not solid, and</p><p>it had no heat. Within it, dimmed as </p><p>though by mist, stood and moved— </p><p>figures. They were human, at least </p><p>they were upright; and they stood in a </p><p>row, like soldiers, all but two. That </p><p>pair was dark-seeming, and one was </p><p>grossly thick, the other thin as an ex- </p><p>clamation point. The line moved, bent, </p><p>formed a weaving circle which spread </p><p>as its units opened their order. Jager </p><p>had never seen such a maneuver in four </p><p>years of army service. </p><p> Now the circle was moving, rolling</p><p>around; the figures were tramping </p><p>counter-clockwise—“withershins” was </p><p>the old-fashioned word for that kind </p><p>of motion, as Jager remembered from </p><p>his boyhood in Pennsylvania. The two </p><p>darker figures, the ones that had stood </p><p>separate, were nowhere to be seen; per- </p><p>haps they were inclosed in the center of </p><p>the turning circle, the moving shapes of </p><p>which numbered six. There had been </p><p>six of Quantrill’s guerrillas that died in </p><p>almost that spot. </p><p> The ground was bare except for</p><p>spring grass, but Jager made shift to </p><p>crawl forward on hands and knees, his </p><p>eyes fixed on the group ahead, his beard </p><p>bristling nervously upon his set chin. </p><p>He crept ten yards, twenty yards, forty. </p><p>Some high stalks of grass, killed but </p><p>not leveled by winter, afforded him a </p><p>bit of cover, and he paused again, tak- </p><p>ing care not to rustle the dry stems. </p><p>He could see the maneuvering crea- </p><p>tures more plainly. </p><p> They were men, all right, standing</p><p>114 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>each upon two legs, waving each two </p><p>arms. No, one of them had only an </p><p>arm and a stump. Had not one of </p><p>Quantrill’s men—yes! It came to the </p><p>back of Jager’s mind that Lanark him- </p><p>self had cut away an enemy’s pistol </p><p>hand with a stroke of his saber. Again </p><p>he reflected that there had been six </p><p>dead guerrillas, and that six were the </p><p>forms treading so strange a measure </p><p>yonder. He began to crawl forward </p><p>again. Sweat made a slow, cold trickle </p><p>along his spine. </p><p> But the two that had stood separate</p><p>from the six were not to be seen any- </p><p>where, inside the circle or out. And </p><p>Jager began to fancy that his first far </p><p>glimpse had shown him something </p><p>strange about that pair of dark forms, </p><p>something inhuman or sub-human. </p><p> Then a shot rang out, clear and</p><p>sharp. It came from beyond the circle </p><p>of creatures and the blue-misted ruins. </p><p>A second shot followed it. </p><p>Jager almost rose into plain view in </p><p>the moonlight, but fell flat a mo- </p><p>ment later. Indeed, he might well </p><p>have been seen by those he spied upon, </p><p>had they not all turned in the direction </p><p>whence the shots'had sounded. Jager </p><p>heard voices, a murmur of them with </p><p>nothing that sounded like articulate </p><p>words. He made bold to rise on his </p><p>hands for a closer look. The six fig- </p><p>ures were moving eastward, as though </p><p>to investigate. </p><p> Jager lifted himself to hands and</p><p>knees, then rose to a crouch. He ran </p><p>forward, drawing his gun as he did so. </p><p>The great uneven shaft that was Fear- </p><p>ful Rock gave him a bar of shadow into </p><p>which he plunged gratefully, and a mo- </p><p>ment later he was at the edge of the </p><p>ruin-filled foundation hole, perhaps at </p><p>the same point where Lanark ha4 </p><p>stood the night before. </p><p> From that pit rose the diluted blue</p><p>radiance that seemed to involve this </p><p>quarter. Staring thus closely, Jager </p><p>found the light similar to that given</p><p>off by rotten wood, or fungi, or certain </p><p>brands of lucifer matches. It was like </p><p>an echo of light, he pondered rather </p><p>absently, and almost grinned at his </p><p>own malapropism. But he was not here </p><p>to make jokes with himself. </p><p> He listened, peered about, then be-</p><p>gan moving cautiously along the lip of </p><p>the foundation hole. Another shot he </p><p>heard, and a loud, defiant yell that </p><p>sounded like Lanark; then an answer- </p><p>ing burst of laughter, throaty and </p><p>muffled, that seemed to come from sev- </p><p>eral mouths at once. Jager felt a new </p><p>and fiercer chill. He, an earnest Prot- </p><p>estant from birth, signed himself with </p><p>the cross—signed himself with the </p><p>right hand that clutched his revolver. </p><p> Yet there was no doubt as to which</p><p>way lay his duty. He skirted the open </p><p>foundation of the ruined house, moved </p><p>eastward over the trampled earth </p><p>where the six things had formed their </p><p>open-order circle. Like Lanark, he saw </p><p>the opened grave-trench. He paused </p><p>and gazed down. </p><p> Two sack-like blotches of pallor lay</p><p>there—Lanark had described them cor- </p><p>rectly: they were empty human skins. </p><p>Jager paused. There was no sound </p><p>from ahead; he peered and saw the </p><p>ravine to eastward, filled with trees and </p><p>gloom. He hesitated at plunging in, </p><p>the place was so ideal an ambush. Even </p><p>as he paused, his toes at the brink of </p><p>the opened grave, he heard a smashing, </p><p>rustling noise. Bodies were returning </p><p>through the twigs and leafage of the </p><p>ravine, returning swiftly. </p><p> Flad they met Lanark and van-</p><p>quished him? Had they spied or sensed </p><p>Jager in their rear? </p><p> He was beside the grave, and since</p><p>FEARFUL ROCK </p><p>115 </p><p>the first year of the war he had known </p><p>what to do, with enemy approaching </p><p>and a deep hole at hand. He dived in, </p><p>head first like a chipmunk into its bur- </p><p>row, and landed on the bottom on all </p><p>fours. </p><p> His first act was to shake his re-</p><p>volver, lest sand had stopped the muz- </p><p>zle. </p><p> A charm from the Long Lost Friend</p><p>book whispered itself through his </p><p>brain, a marksman’s charm to bring </p><p>accuracy with the gun. He repeated </p><p>it, half audibly, without knowing what </p><p>the words might mean: </p><p> “Ut nemo in sense tentant, descendre</p><p>nemo; at precedenti spectatur mantica </p><p>ter go” </p><p> At that instant his eyes fell upon the</p><p>nearest of the two pallid, empty skins, </p><p>which lay full in the moonlight. He </p><p>forgot everything else. For he knew </p><p>that collapsed face, even without the </p><p>sharp stiletto-like bone of the nose to </p><p>jut forth in its center. He knew that </p><p>narrowness through the jowls and </p><p>temples, that height of brow, that hair </p><p>white as thisdedown. </p><p> Persil Mandifer’s skull had been in-</p><p>side. It must have been there, and liv- </p><p>ing, recently. Jager’s left hand crept </p><p>out, and drew quickly back as though it </p><p>had touched a snake. The texture of </p><p>the skin was soft, clammy, moist . . . </p><p>fresh! </p><p> And the other pallidity like a great</p><p>empty bladder—that could have fitted </p><p>no other body than the gross one of </p><p>Larue Mandifer. </p><p> Thus, Jager realized, had Lanark</p><p>entered the grave on the night before, </p><p>and found these same two skins. Look- </p><p>ing up, Lanark had found a horrid </p><p>enemy waiting to grapple him. </p><p> Jager, too, looked up.</p><p> A towering silhouette shut out half</p><p>the starry sky overhead. </p><p>13. Lanark </p><p>n^HE combination of pluck and com- </p><p> mon sense is something of a rarity,</p><p>and men who possess that combination </p><p>are apt to go far. Kane Lanark was </p><p>such a man, and though he charged un- </p><p>hesitatingly across the little strip of </p><p>water and at the unknown thing in the </p><p>trees, he was not outrunning his discre- </p><p>tion. </p><p> He had seen men die in his time,</p><p>many of them in abject flight, with bul- </p><p>lets overtaking them in the spine 01* the </p><p>back of the head. It was nothing pleas- </p><p>ant to watch, but it crystallized within </p><p>his mind the realization that dread of </p><p>death is no armor against danger, and </p><p>that an enemy attacked is far less for- </p><p>midable than an enemy attacking. That </p><p>brace of maxims comforted him and </p><p>bore him up in more tight places than </p><p>one. </p><p> And General Blunt of the Army</p><p>of the Frontier, an officer who was all </p><p>that his name implies and who was </p><p>never given to overstatement, once so </p><p>unbent as to say in official writing that </p><p>Captain Kane Lanark was an ornament </p><p>to any combat force. </p><p> And so his rush was nothing fran-</p><p>tic. All that faltered was his lame leg. </p><p>He meant to destroy the thing that had </p><p>showed itself, but fully as definitely he </p><p>meant not to be destroyed by it. As he </p><p>ran, he flung his revolver across to his </p><p>left hand and dragged free the saber </p><p>that danced at his side. </p><p> But the creature he wanted to meet</p><p>did not bide his coming. He heard an- </p><p>other crash and rattle—it had backed </p><p>into some shrubs or bushes farther in </p><p>among the trees. He paused under the </p><p>branches of the first belt of timber, </p><p>well aware that he was probably a fair </p><p>mark for a bullet. Yet he did not ex- </p><p>pect a gun in the hands of whatever </p><p>116 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>lurked ahead; he was not sure at all </p><p>that it even had hands. </p><p> Of a sudden he felt, rather than saw,</p><p>motion upon his left flank. He pivoted </p><p>upon the heel of his sound right foot </p><p>and, lifting the saber, spat profession- </p><p>ally between hilt and palm. Lie meant </p><p>killing, did Lanark, but nothing pre- </p><p>sented itself. A chuckle drifted to him, </p><p>a contemptuous burble of sound; he </p><p>thought of what Enid had said about </p><p>divining her stepfather’s mockery. </p><p>Again the chuckle, dying away toward </p><p>the left. </p><p> But up ahead came more noise of</p><p>motion, and this was identifiable as feet </p><p>—heavy, measured tramping of feet. </p><p>New and stupid recruits walked like </p><p>that, in their first drills. So did tired </p><p>soldiers on the march. And the feet </p><p>were coming his way. </p><p> Lanark’s first reaction to this reali-</p><p>zation was of relief. Marching men, </p><p>even enemies, would be welcome be- </p><p>cause he knew how to deal with them. </p><p>Then he thought of Enid behind him, </p><p>probably in retreat out of the gully. </p><p>He must give her time to get away. Lie </p><p>moved westward, toward the approach- </p><p>ing party, but with caution and silence. </p><p> The moonlight came patchily down</p><p>through the lattice-like mass of </p><p>branches and twigs, and again Lanark </p><p>saw motion. This time it was directly </p><p>ahead. He counted five, then six figures, </p><p>quite human. The moonlight, when </p><p>they moved in it, gave him glimpses of </p><p>butternut shirts, white faces. One had </p><p>a great waterfall of beard. </p><p> Lanark drew a deep breath.</p><p>“Stand!” he shouted, and with his left </p><p>hand leveled his pistol. </p><p> They stood, but only for a moment.</p><p>Each figure’s attitude shifted ever so </p><p>slightly as Lanark moved a pace for- </p><p>ward. The trees were sparse around </p><p>him, and the moon shone stronger </p><p>through their branches. He recognized</p><p>the man with the great beard—he did </p><p>not need to see that one arm was hewed </p><p>away halfway between wrist and elbow. </p><p>Another face was equally familiar, with </p><p>its sharp mustaches and wide eyes; he </p><p>had stared into it no longer ago than </p><p>last night. </p><p> The six guerrillas stirred into mo-</p><p>tion again, approaching and closing in. </p><p>Lanark had them before him in a semi- </p><p>circle. </p><p> “Stand!” he said again, and when</p><p>they did not he fired, full for the center </p><p>of that black beard in the forefront. </p><p>The body of the guerrilla started and </p><p>staggered—no more. It had been hit, </p><p>but it was not going to fall. Lanark </p><p>knew a sudden damp closeness about </p><p>him, as though he stood in a small </p><p>room full of sweaty garments. The </p><p>six figures were converging, like beasts </p><p>seeking a common trough or manger. </p><p> He did not shoot again. The man</p><p>he had shot was not bleeding. Six pairs </p><p>of eyes fixed themselves upon him, with </p><p>a steadiness that was more than un- </p><p>winking. He wondered, inconsequen- </p><p>tially, if those eyes had lids. . . . Now </p><p>they were within reach. </p><p> He fell quickly on guard with his</p><p>saber, whirling it to left and then to </p><p>right, the old moulinets he had learned </p><p>in the fencing-room at the Virginia </p><p>Military Institute. Again the half- </p><p>dozen approachers came to an abrupt </p><p>stop, one or two flinching back from the </p><p>twinkling tongue of steel. Lanark ex- </p><p>tended his arm, made a wider hori- </p><p>zontal sweep with his point, and the </p><p>space before him widened. The two </p><p>forms at the horns of the semi-circle </p><p>began to slip forward and outward, as </p><p>though to pass him and take him in the </p><p>rear. </p><p> “That won’t do,” Lanark said aloud,</p><p>and hopped quickly forward, then </p><p>FEARFUL ROCK </p><p>117 </p><p>lunged at the biackbeard. His point met </p><p>flesh, or at least a soft substance. No </p><p>bones impeded it. A moment later his </p><p>basket-hilt thudded against the butter- </p><p>nut shirt front, the figure reeled back- </p><p>ward from the force of the blow. With </p><p>a practised wrench, Lanark cleared his </p><p>weapon, cutting fiercely at another who </p><p>wras moving upon him with an unnerv- </p><p>ing lightness. His edge came home, </p><p>and he drew it vigorously toward him- </p><p>self—a bread-slicing maneuver that </p><p>would surely lay flesh open to the bone, </p><p>disable one assailant. But the creature </p><p>only tottered and came in again, and </p><p>Lanark saw that the face he had hacked </p><p>almost in two was the one with bulge </p><p>eyes and spike mustaches. </p><p> All he could do was side-step and</p><p>then retreat—retreat eastward in the </p><p>direction of Fearful Rock. The black- </p><p>bearded thing was down, stumbled or </p><p>swooning, and he sprang across it. As </p><p>he did so the body writhed just beneath </p><p>him, clutching with one hand upward. </p><p>Hooked by an ankle, Lanark fell </p><p>sprawling at full length, losing his re- </p><p>volver but not his sword. He twisted </p><p>over at his left side, hacking murder- </p><p>ously in the direction of his feet. As </p><p>once before, he cut away a hand and </p><p>wrist and was free. He surged to his </p><p>feet, and found the biackbeard also up, </p><p>thrusting its hairy, fishy-white face at </p><p>him. With dark rage swelling his every </p><p>muscle, Lanark carried his right arm </p><p>back across his chest, his right hand </p><p>with the hilt going over his left shoul- </p><p>der. Then he struck at the hairy head </p><p>with all the power of arm and shoulder </p><p>and, turning his body, thrust in its </p><p>weight behind the blow. The head flew </p><p>from the shoulders, as though it had </p><p>been stuck there ever so lightly. </p><p> Then the others were pushing</p><p>around and upon him. Lanark smelled </p><p>blood, rot, dampness, filth. He heard, </p><p>for the first time, soft snickering </p><p>voices, that spoke no words but seemed </p><p>to be sneering at him for the entertain- </p><p>ment of one another. The work was </p><p>too close to thrust; he hacked and</p><p>hewed, and struck with the curved </p><p>guard as with brass knuckles. And they </p><p>fell back from him, all but one form </p><p>that could not see. </p><p> It tottered heavily and gropingly to-</p><p>ward him, hunching its headless shoul- </p><p>ders and holding out its handless arms, </p><p>as though it played with him a game of </p><p>blind-man’s-buff. And from that horrid </p><p>truncated enemy Lanark fled, fled like </p><p>a deer for all his lameness. </p><p>rpHEY followed, but they made slow, </p><p> stupid work of it. Lanark’s sword,</p><p>which could not kill, had wounded them </p><p>all. Fie was well ahead, coming to ris- </p><p>ing ground, toiling upward out of the </p><p>gully, into the open country shadowed </p><p>by Fearful Rock. </p><p> He paused there, clear of the trees,</p><p>wiped his clammy brow with the sleeve </p><p>of his left arm. The moon was so </p><p>bright overhead that it almost blinded </p><p>him. He became aware of a knead- </p><p>ing, clasping sensation at his right </p><p>ankle, and looked down to see what </p><p>caused it. </p><p> A hand clung there, a hand without</p><p>arm or body. It was a pale hand that </p><p>moved and crawled, as if trying to </p><p>mount his boot-leg and get at his belly </p><p>—his heart—his throat. The bright </p><p>moon showed him the strained tendons </p><p>of it, and the scant coarse hair upon </p><p>its wide back. </p><p> Lanark opened his lips to scream</p><p>like any woman, but no sound came. </p><p>With his other foot he scraped the </p><p>thing loose and away. Its fingers quitted </p><p>their hold grudgingly, and under the </p><p>sole of his boot they curled and writhed </p><p>upward, like the legs of an overturned </p><p>118 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>crab. They fastened upon his instep. </p><p> When, with the point of his saber,</p><p>he forced the thing free again, still he </p><p>saw that it lived and groped for a hold </p><p>upon him. With his lip clenched blood- </p><p>ily between his teeth, he chopped and </p><p>minced at the horrid little thing, and </p><p>even then its severed fingers humped </p><p>and inched upon the ground, like </p><p>worms. </p><p> “It won’t die,” Lanark murmured</p><p>hoarsely, aloud; often in the past he </p><p>had thought that speaking thus, when </p><p>one was alone, presaged insanity. “It </p><p>won’t die—not though I chop it into </p><p>atoms until the evil is driven away.” </p><p> Then he wondered, for the first time</p><p>since he had left Enid, where Jager </p><p>was. He turned in the direction of the </p><p>rock and the ruined house, and walked </p><p>wearily for perhaps twenty paces. He </p><p>was swimming in sweat, and blood </p><p>throbbed in his ears. </p><p> Then he found himself looking into</p><p>the open grave where the guerrillas had </p><p>lain, whence they had issued to fight </p><p>once more. At the bottom he saw the </p><p>two palenesses that were empty skins. </p><p> He saw something else—a dark form</p><p>that was trying to scramble out. Once </p><p>again he tightened his grip upon the hilt </p><p>of his saber. </p><p> At the same instant he knew that still</p><p>another creature was hurrying out of </p><p>the gulley and at him from behind. </p><p>14.	Enid</p><p>T anark’s guess was wrong; Enid </p><p>Mandifer had not retreated west- </p><p>ward up the gulley. </p><p> She had stared, all in a heart-stop-</p><p>ping chill, as Lanark made for the thing </p><p>that terrified her. As though of them- </p><p>selves, her hands reached down to the </p><p>earth, found her dress, and pulled it </p><p>over her head. She thrust her feet into </p><p>her shoes. Then she moved, at only a </p><p>fast walk, after Lanark. </p><p> There was really nothing eise she</p><p>could have done, and Lanark might </p><p>have known that, had he been able to </p><p>take thought in the moments that fol- </p><p>lowed. Llad she fled, she would have </p><p>had no place to go save to the house </p><p>where once her stepfather had lived; </p><p>and it would be no refuge, but a place </p><p>of whispering horror. Too, she would </p><p>be alone, dreadfully alone. It took no </p><p>meditation on her part to settle the </p><p>fact that Lanark was her one hope of </p><p>protection. As a matter of simple fact, </p><p>he would have done well to remain </p><p>with her, on the defensive; but then, he </p><p>could not have foreseen what was wait- </p><p>ing in the shadowed woods beyond. </p><p> She did carry something that might</p><p>serve as a weapon—the hand-mirror. </p><p>And in a pocket of her dress lay the </p><p>Bible, of which she had once told </p><p>Lanark. She had read much in it, </p><p>driven by terror, and I daresay it was </p><p>as much a talisman to her as was the </p><p>Long Lost Friend to Jager. Her lips </p><p>pattered a verse from it: “Deliver me </p><p>from mine enemies, O my God . . . for </p><p>lo, they lie in wait for my soul.” </p><p> It was hard for her to decide what</p><p>she had expected to find within the </p><p>rim of trees beyond the clearing. Lan- </p><p>ark was not in sight, but a commotion </p><p>had risen some little distance ahead. </p><p>Enid moved onward, because she must </p><p> She heard Lanark’s pistol shot, and</p><p>then what sounded like several men </p><p>struggling. She tried to peer and see, </p><p>but there was only a swirl of violent </p><p>motion, and through it the flash of </p><p>steel—that would be Lanark’s saber. </p><p>She crouched behind a wide trunk. </p><p> “That is useless,” said an accented</p><p>voice she knew, close at her elbow. </p><p> She spun around, stared and sprang</p><p>away. It was not her stepfather that </p><p>FEARFUL ROCK </p><p>119 </p><p>stood there. The form was human to </p><p>some degree—it had arms and legs, </p><p>and a featureless head; but its naked- </p><p>ness was slimy wet and dark, and about </p><p>it clung a smell of blood. </p><p> “That is useless,” muttered once</p><p>more the voice of Persil Mandifer. </p><p>“You do not hide from the power that </p><p>rules this place.” </p><p> Behind the first dark slimness came</p><p>a second shape, a gross immensity, </p><p>equally black and foul and shiny. </p><p>Larue? </p><p> “You have offered yourself,” said</p><p>Persil Mandifer, though Enid could </p><p>see no lips move in the filthy-seeming </p><p>shadow that should have been a face. </p><p>“I think you will be accepted this time. </p><p>Of course, it cannot profit me—what </p><p>I am now, I shall be always. Perhaps </p><p>you, too-” </p><p> Larue's voice chuckled, and Enid</p><p>ran, toward where Lanark had been </p><p>fighting. That would be more endur- </p><p>able than this mad dream forced upon </p><p>her. Anything would be more endur- </p><p>able. Twigs and thorns plucked at her </p><p>skirt like spiteful fingers, but she ripped </p><p>away from them and ran. She came </p><p>into another clearing, a small one. The </p><p>moon, striking between the boughs, </p><p>made here a pool of light and touched </p><p>up something of metal. </p><p> It was Lanark’s revolver. Enid bent</p><p>and seized it. A few feet away rested </p><p>something else, something rather like a </p><p>strangely shaggy cabbage. As Enid </p><p>touched the gun, she saw what that </p><p>fringed rondure was. A head, but liv- </p><p>ing, as though its owner had been </p><p>buried to his bearded chin. </p><p> “What-” she began to ask aloud.</p><p>It was surely living, its eyebrows </p><p>arched and scowled and its gleaming </p><p>eyes moved. Its tongue crawled out </p><p>and licked grinning, hairy lips. She saw </p><p>its smile, hard and brief as a knife </p><p>flashed for a moment from its scab- </p><p>bard. </p><p> Enid Mandifer almost dropped the</p><p>revolver. She had become sickeningly </p><p>aware that the head possessed no body. </p><p> “There is the rest of him,” spoke</p><p>Persil Mandifer, again behind her </p><p>shoulder. And she saw a heart-shak- </p><p>ing terror, staggering and groping be- </p><p>tween the trees, a body without a head </p><p>or hands. </p><p> She ran again, but slowly and pain-</p><p>fully, as though this were in truth a </p><p>nightmare. The headless hulk seemed </p><p>to divine her effort at retreat, for it </p><p>dragged itself clumsily across, as </p><p>though to cut her off. It held out its </p><p>handless stumps of arms. </p><p> “No use to shoot,” came Persil</p><p>Mandifer's mocking comment—he was </p><p>following swiftly. “That poor creature </p><p>cannot be killed again.” </p><p>Zither shapes were approaching </p><p>^ from all sides, shapes dressed in </p><p>filthy, ragged clothes. The face of one </p><p>was divided by a dark cleft, as though </p><p>Lanark’s saber had split it, but no </p><p>blood showed, iinother seemed to have </p><p>no lower jaw; the remaining top of his </p><p>face jutted forward, like the short </p><p>visage of a snake lifted to strike. These </p><p>things had eyes, turned unblinkingly </p><p>upon her; they could see and approach. </p><p> The headless torso blundered at her</p><p>again, went past by inches. It recov- </p><p>ered itself and turned. It knew, some- </p><p>how, that she was there; it was trying </p><p>to capture her. She shrank away, star- </p><p>ing around for an avenue of escape. </p><p> “Be thankful,” droned Persil Man-</p><p>difer from somewhere. “These are no </p><p>more than dead men, whipped into a </p><p>mockery of life. They will prepare you </p><p>a little for the wonders to come.” </p><p> But Enid had commanded her shud-</p><p>dering muscles. She ran. One of the </p><p>120 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>things caught her sleeve, but the cloth </p><p>tore and she won free. She heard </p><p>sounds that could hardly be called </p><p>voices, from the mouths of such as had </p><p>mouths. And Persil Mandifer laughed </p><p>quietly, and said something in a lan- </p><p>guage Enid had never heard before. </p><p>The thick voice of his son Larue an- </p><p>swered him in the same tongue, then </p><p>called out in English: </p><p> “Enid, you only run in the direction</p><p>we want you to run!” </p><p> It was true, and there was nothing</p><p>that she could do about it. The entities </p><p>behind her were following, not very </p><p>fast, like herdsmen leisurely driving a </p><p>sheep in the way it should go. And she </p><p>knew that the sides of the gulley, to </p><p>north and south, could never be </p><p>climbed. There was only the slope </p><p>ahead to the eastward, up which Lan- </p><p>ark must have gone. The thought of </p><p>him strengthened her. If the two of </p><p>them found the king-horror, the Name- </p><p>less One, at the base of Fearful Rock, </p><p>they could face it together. </p><p> She was aware that she had come</p><p>out of the timber of the ravine. </p><p> All was moonlight here, painted by</p><p>the soft pallor in grays and silvers and </p><p>shadow-blacks. There was the rock </p><p>lifted among the stars, there the stretch </p><p>of clump-dotted plain—and here, al- </p><p>most before her, Lanark. </p><p> He stood poised above a hole in the</p><p>ground, his saber lifted above his head </p><p>as though to begin a downward sweep. </p><p>Something burly was climbing up out of </p><p>that hole. But, even as he tightened his </p><p>sinews to strike, Lanark whirled </p><p>around, and his eyes glared murder- </p><p>ously at Enid. </p><p>15.	Evil’s End,</p><p>“T'Von’t!” Enid screamed. “Don’t, </p><p> U it’s only I-”</p><p> Lanark growled, and spun back to</p><p>face what was now hoisting itself above </p><p>ground level. </p><p> “And be careful of me, too” said the</p><p>object. “It’s Jager, Mr. Lanark.” </p><p>The point of the saber lowered. The </p><p>three of them wrere standing close to- </p><p>gether on the edge of the opened grave. </p><p>Lanark looked down. Fie saw at the </p><p>bottom the two areas of loose white. </p><p> “Are those the-”</p><p> “Yes,” Jager replied without waiting</p><p>for him to finish. “Two human skins. </p><p>They are fresh; soft and damp.” Enid </p><p>was listening, but she was past shudder- </p><p>ing. “One of them,” continued Jager, </p><p>“was taken from Persil Mandifer. I </p><p>know his face.” </p><p> He made a scuffing kick-motion with</p><p>one boot. Clods flew into the grave, </p><p>falling with a dull plop, as upon wet </p><p>blankets. He kicked more earth down, </p><p>swiftly and savagely. </p><p> “Help me,” he said to the others.</p><p>“Salt should be thrown on those skins </p><p>—that’s what the old legends say—but </p><p>we have no salt. Dirt will have to do. </p><p>Don’t you see?” he almost shrieked. </p><p>“Somewhere near here, two bodies are </p><p>hiding, or moving about, without these </p><p>skins to cover them.” </p><p> Both Lanark and Enid knew they</p><p>had seen those bodies. In a moment </p><p>three pairs of feet were thrusting earth </p><p>down into the grave. </p><p> “Don’t!” It was a wail from the</p><p>trees in the ravine, a wail in the voice </p><p>of Persil Mandifer. “We must return </p><p>to those skins before dawn!” </p><p> Two black silhouettes, wetly shiny in</p><p>the moonlight, had come into the open. </p><p>Behind them straggled six more, the </p><p>guerrillas. </p><p> “Don’t!” came the cry again, this</p><p>time a command. “You cannot destroy </p><p>us now. It is midnight, the hour of the </p><p>Nameless One.” </p><p> At the word “midnight” an idea</p><p>FEARFUL ROCK </p><p>121 </p><p>fairly exploded itself in Lanark’s brain. </p><p>He thrust his sword into the hands of </p><p>his old sergeant. </p><p> “Guard against them,” he said in</p><p>the old tone of command. “That book </p><p>of yours may serve as shield, and </p><p>Enid’s Bible. I have something else </p><p>to do.” </p><p> He turned and ran around the edge</p><p>of the grave, then toward the hole that </p><p>was filled with the ruins of the old </p><p>house; the hole that emitted a glowr of </p><p>weak blue light. </p><p> Into it he flung himself, wondering</p><p>if this diluted gleam of the old un- </p><p>earthly blaze would burn him. It did </p><p>not; his booted legs felt warmth like </p><p>that of a hot stove, no more. From </p><p>above he heard the voice of Jager, </p><p>shouting, tensely and masterfully, a </p><p>formula from the Long Lost Friend: </p><p> “Ye evil things, stand and look upon</p><p>me for a moment, while I charm three </p><p>drops of blood from you, which you </p><p>have forfeited. The first from your </p><p>teeth, the second from your lungs, the </p><p>third from your heart’s own main.” </p><p>Louder went his voice, and higher, as </p><p>though he had to fight to keep down his </p><p>hysteria: “God bid me vanquish you </p><p>all!” </p><p> Lanark had reached the upward col-</p><p>umn of the broken chimney. All about </p><p>his fe t lay fragments, glowing blue. </p><p>Lie shoved at them with his toe. There </p><p>was an oblong of metal. He touched </p><p>it—yes, that had been a door to an old </p><p>brick oven. He lifted it. Underneath </p><p>lay what he had hidden four years ago </p><p>—a case of unknown construction. </p><p> But as he picked it up, he saw that</p><p>it had a lid. What had Enid over- </p><p>heard from her stepfather, so long ago ? </p><p> . . that he would live and prosper</p><p>until the secret writing should be taken </p><p>forth and destroyed ... it would never </p><p>open, save at the place of the Nameless </p><p>One, at midnight under a full moon.” </p><p>With his thumbnail he pried at the </p><p>lid, and it came open easily. The box </p><p>seemed full of darkness, and when he </p><p>thrust in his hands he felt something </p><p>crumble, like paper burned to ashes. </p><p>That was what it was—ashes. Lie </p><p>turned the case over, and let the flakes </p><p>fall out, like strange black snow. </p><p> From somewhere resounded a shriek,</p><p>or chorus of shrieks. Then a woman </p><p>weeping—that would be Enid—and a </p><p>cry of “God be thanked!” unmistak- </p><p>ably from Jager. The blue light died </p><p>away all around Lanark, and his legs </p><p>were cool. The old basement had </p><p>fallen strangely dark. Then he was </p><p>aware of great fatigue, the trembling </p><p>of his hands, the ropy weakness of his </p><p>lamed leg. And he could not climb out </p><p>again, until Jager came and put down </p><p>a hand. </p><p> A T ROSY dawn the three sat on the</p><p>front stoop of Jager’s cabin. Enid </p><p>was pouring coffee from a serviceable </p><p>old black pot. </p><p> “We shall never know all that hap-</p><p>pened and portended,” said Jager, tak- </p><p>ing a mouthful of home-made bread, </p><p>“but what we have seen will tell us all </p><p>that we should know.” </p><p> “This much is plain,” added Lanark.</p><p>“Persil Mandifer worshipped an evil </p><p>spirit, and that evil spirit had life and </p><p>power.” </p><p> “Perhaps we would know every-</p><p>thing, if the paper in the box had not </p><p>burned in the fire,” went on Jager. </p><p>“That is probably as well—that it </p><p>burned, I mean. Some secrets are just </p><p>as well never told.” Lie fell thought- </p><p>ful, pulled his beard, and went on. </p><p>“Even burned, the power of that docu- </p><p>ment worked; but when the ashes fell </p><p>from their case, all was over. The </p><p>bodies of the guerrillas were dry bones </p><p>122 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>on the instant, and as for the skinless </p><p>things that moved and spoke as Mandi- </p><p>fer and his son-” </p><p> He broke off, for Enid had turned</p><p>deathly pale at memory of that part of </p><p>the business. </p><p> “We shall go back when the sun is</p><p>well up,” said Lanark, “and put those </p><p>things back to rest in their grave.” </p><p> He sat for a moment, coffee-cup in</p><p>hand, and gazed into the brightening </p><p>sky. </p><p> To the two items he had spoken of</p><p>as plainly indicated, he mentally added </p><p>a third; the worship carried on by Per- </p><p>sil Mandifer—was that name French, </p><p>perhaps Main-de-Fer?—was tremen- </p><p>dously old. Lie, Persil, must have re- </p><p>ceived teachings in it from a former </p><p>votary, his father perhaps, and must </p><p>have conducted a complex and secret </p><p>ritual for decades. </p><p> The attempted sacrifice rite for</p><p>which Enid had been destined was </p><p>something the world would never </p><p>know, not as regards the climax. For </p><p>a little band of Yankee horsemen, with </p><p>himself at their head, had blundered </p><p>into the situation, throwing it com- </p><p>pletely out of order and spelling for it </p><p>the beginning of the end. </p><p> The end had come. Lanark was</p><p>sure of that. How much of the power </p><p>and motivity of the worship had been </p><p>exerted by the Nameless One that now </p><p>must continue nameless, how much of it </p><p>was Persil Mandifer’s doing, how much </p><p>was accident of nature and horror- </p><p>hallucination of witnesses, nobody could </p><p>now decide. As Jager had suggested, </p><p>it was probably as well that part of the </p><p>mystery would remain. Things being as </p><p>they were, one might pick up the </p><p>threads of his normal human existence, </p><p>and be happy and fearless. </p><p> But he could not forget what he had</p><p>seen. The two Mandifers, able to live </p><p>or to counterfeit life by creeping from</p><p>their skins at night, had perished as in- </p><p>explicably as they had been resurrected. </p><p>The guerrillas, too, whose corpses had </p><p>challenged him, must be finding a grate- </p><p>ful rest now that the awful semblance </p><p>of life had quitted their slack, butch- </p><p>ered limbs. And the blue fire that had </p><p>burst forth in the midst of the old </p><p>battle, to linger ghostwise for years; </p><p>the horned image that Jager had </p><p>broken; the seeming powers of the </p><p>Long Lost Friend, as an amulet and a </p><p>storehouse of charms—these were </p><p>items in the strange fabric. He would </p><p>remember them for ever, without ra- </p><p>tionalizing them. </p><p> He drank coffee, into which some-</p><p>one, probably Enid, had dropped sugar </p><p>while he mused. Rationalization, he </p><p>decided, was not enough, had never </p><p>been enough. To judge a large and </p><p>dark mystery by what vestigial portions </p><p>touched one, was to err like the blind </p><p>men in the old doggerel who, groping </p><p>at an elephant here and there, called </p><p>it in turn a snake, a spear, a tree, a </p><p>fan, a wall. Better not to brood or </p><p>ponder upon what had happened. Try </p><p>to be thankful, and forget. </p><p> “I shall build my church under Fear-</p><p>ful Rock,” Jager was saying, “and it </p><p>shall be called Fearful Rock- no more, </p><p>but Welcome Rock.” </p><p> Lanark looked up. Enid had come</p><p>and seated herself beside him. He </p><p>studied her profile. Suddenly he could </p><p>read her thoughts, as plainly as though </p><p>they were written upon her cheek. </p><p> She was thinking that grass would</p><p>grow anew in her front yard, and that </p><p>she would marry Kane Lanark as soon </p><p>as he asked her. </p><p>I </p><p>[the end] </p><p>“His head began to turn on his stooped </p><p>shoulders—to turn slowly, slowly. And </p><p>of a sudden I thought I was going </p><p>mad.” </p><p>lgh Places </p><p> By FRANCES GARFIELD</p><p> A ghost story of aviation</p><p> . . . the high places of our air are swarming</p><p>full of those Tricked spirits, whose temptations </p><p>trouble us. </p><p>Cotton Mather.—The Devil Discovered. </p><p>WE WERE still arguing as </p><p>Swithin parked his car in the </p><p>gloom at the edge of the air- </p><p>port — arguing gently. Everything </p><p>about Swithin was gentle, even his ar- </p><p>guments. For a moment we sat together </p><p>in the snug dim light of the car’s in- </p><p>terior. Swithin’s lean gloved hands </p><p>rested slackly on the wheel, and his soft </p><p>gray eyes regarded me thoughtfully, </p><p>studiously. </p><p> “Here we are, Katharine,” he said,</p><p>“but I still have that premonition about </p><p>the danger of your flying. For the last </p><p> 123</p><p>i </p><p>124 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>time, please let me take you to the rail- </p><p>road station.” </p><p> “And for the last time,” I said</p><p>firmly, “I’ve got to budget my hours. </p><p>I want to spend the week with my </p><p>brother, not on trains.” </p><p> It was true. I could spare only a</p><p>week from my job, and my brother Bill </p><p>was getting married, a thousand miles </p><p>away in Chicago. A plane was the </p><p>only answer, and Swithin at last bowed </p><p>his brown head in token of defeat. We </p><p>got out together, went through a gate, </p><p>and across the wide, flat field. </p><p> The long hangar was dimly illumi-</p><p>nated at one end, with only three or </p><p>four men in sight—mechanics, I sup- </p><p>posed. Floodlights illumined a ce- </p><p>mented patch, with strange shadows </p><p>clustered around. No other passengers; </p><p>I would be alone on the spur hop to </p><p>Wichita, where we met the TWA. </p><p>Swithin put his arm around me. </p><p>“Wire me at once when you land,” </p><p>he whispered, and kissed me. It </p><p>soothed, that kiss, if it did not galva- </p><p>nize. “And now I’ll go. I hate to see a </p><p>loved one sail away from me.” </p><p> We parted, and I turned to meet an</p><p>attendant who took from me my two </p><p>suitcases. The plane was already buzz- </p><p>ing, like a huge dragon-fly ready to </p><p>skim off above oceanic ponds and im- </p><p>mense reeds and lily pads. And now I </p><p>thought, as I tried not to think, of Enic </p><p>Graf, who had done things to my heart </p><p>I had never thought possible, who had </p><p>hurt and dazzled me, whom I was to </p><p>have married when, a year ago, he fell </p><p>out of the sky, aflame in a flaming ship. </p><p> Dead now, his body ashes where</p><p>other bodies were dust, he could still </p><p>make my heart stop, my feet falter, my </p><p>lips grow dry. Even now I had not </p><p>wholly escaped his compelling, crude </p><p>grasp; not even though Swithin and I </p><p>had found each other, had settled into </p><p>a tender and peaceable relationship of </p><p>understanding happiness.</p><p>npriE pilot was before me, saluting as </p><p>•**though I were a superior officer. </p><p> “You’re the passenger for Wichita,</p><p>lady?” he asked in a high, cheerful </p><p>voice. “We’re ready if you are.” </p><p> “Thank you,” I said. Who had said</p><p>that all pilots resembled each other, </p><p>with piercing, narrow eyes and square </p><p>jaws? This was a thin-faced young </p><p>man, stooped in. the shoulders and as </p><p>anxious to please as a waiter. Not </p><p>much about him of Rickenbacker, Lind- </p><p>bergh, Corrigan, nothing at all of Enic </p><p>Graf. “What sort of a journey will we </p><p>have?” </p><p> He shook his head dubiously. “Lots</p><p>of clouds off there,” he said, and for </p><p>the first time I realized that the moon </p><p>should be shining. </p><p> He helped me into the cabin of the</p><p>plane. It was all of brown paneling </p><p>and wide glass panes, like the inside </p><p>of a station wagon, and had room for </p><p>only three passengers. I took the seat </p><p>behind his, and he drew a safety belt </p><p>of strong webbing across in front. </p><p> “Maybe we’ll have bumpy weather,”</p><p>he explained. </p><p> And then we were off, off and up. A</p><p>glance sidewise showed me the lights </p><p>and the hangar dropping and dwin- </p><p>dling. Dew seemed forming on the </p><p>pane beside me, and the upward slope </p><p>of the ship made me slide down into </p><p>the angle of the seat. </p><p> I had never flown before—strange,</p><p>since I had known and loved Enic. I </p><p>would not be flying now, if Swithin </p><p>had had his way. I sought for novel </p><p>impressions, but it all seemed as if I </p><p>had done it before. Perhaps too many </p><p>friends had talked to me of the joys </p><p>and thrills of flying. </p><p> The light in the cabin was too dim to</p><p>THE HIGH PLACES </p><p>125 </p><p>read by, and in any case a humming vi- </p><p>bration of the craft would make read- </p><p>ing uncomfortable. I leaned back and </p><p>closed my eyes, thinking of Bill and his </p><p>approaching happiness, of the gift I </p><p>had brought for the Mrs. Bill to be— </p><p>a Zorinos cape, one I would have loved </p><p>to keep. It was stowed behind me, in </p><p>one of the suitcases, all of brown skins </p><p>sewed together in little bands that dis- </p><p>played in a succession of patterns, like </p><p>the graining of fine wood, the pelt- </p><p>markings. She would like it, no matter </p><p>what type of woman she might be. The </p><p>thought came, and I dismissed it, of the </p><p>day when my own wedding had been at </p><p>hand, and the news of Enic’s crash </p><p>came like a heavy door slamming </p><p>against my face. And then I was asleep. </p><p>I dreamed the plane was falling. </p><p> I awakened with a sickening jerk. I</p><p>may have screamed. The pilot turned </p><p>halfway around. </p><p> “What’s the matter, lady?” he called</p><p>above the growl of the motor. </p><p> “I had a bad dream,” I called back.</p><p> “Don’t be scared. No danger. Just</p><p>bumpy weather—clouds. I’m going to </p><p>get above them.” </p><p> There was evidently rain, and the</p><p>windows were thickly misted. The pilot </p><p>did things with his controls, and again </p><p>the nose of the craft lifted itself, as </p><p>though it climbed steep stairs. I could </p><p>see the hands of the pilot on his in- </p><p>struments. They, at least, were typical, </p><p>comfortingly so—big, blunt, capable. </p><p>Enic’s hands had been long and sensi- </p><p>tive, like a surgeon's or a violinist’s, </p><p>and across the back of his right hand </p><p>had sprawled a jagged Z of a scar. </p><p>Again I drove the thought of him from </p><p>my mind, and lay back for another </p><p>snatch of the sleep that seemed de- </p><p>termined to possess me. </p><p> My awakening was calm. The plane</p><p>flew on a smooth level, and light filled </p><p>the abyss outside my window. I mopped</p><p>with one gloved hand at the glass, and </p><p>peered out into a sky filled with the </p><p>light of the great cream-colored moon. </p><p>Far below were the clouds, or what </p><p>must be the clouds, a drab continent </p><p>without visible rent or lump in it. 1 </p><p>gasped with the beauty of it, then with </p><p>the terror of thinking how high we </p><p>must be. </p><p> “What’s our altitude, pilot?” I cried</p><p>out, trying to be gay. </p><p> His head began to turn on his</p><p>stooped shoulders—to turn slowly, </p><p>slowly. And of a sudden I thought I </p><p>was going mad. </p><p>Tt was not his lean face that came </p><p> around, but the face of another, a</p><p>face that I knew. Square jaw, wide lips </p><p>with bracket-like lines at their corners, </p><p>proud broken nose, eyes as deep and </p><p>dark and shining as two pools by lan- </p><p>ternlight—so pale, so stiff, so utterly </p><p>without the flavor of Enic Graf, yet so </p><p>unmistakably Enic. </p><p> Frost-cold nails of fear dug into my</p><p>backbone. I reasoned with myself, </p><p>flatly and a little stupidly, as one rea- </p><p>sons with a panicky child. This wasn’t </p><p>Enic—Enic’s handful of remains had </p><p>gone to the grave twelve months be- </p><p>fore. It was a mask. That was it, a </p><p>false face, cunningly made but not cun- </p><p>ningly enough. </p><p> I leaned forward.</p><p> “This is a very poor joke,” I said,</p><p>too loudly for dignity. “And it’s a cruel </p><p>one.” </p><p> And I heard his soft chuckle, as</p><p>plainly as though the engine had shut </p><p>off—his soft, deep chuckle, the chuckle </p><p>with which Enic once maddened and </p><p>conquered me. The face came all the </p><p>way around, and, for all its stiffness </p><p>and dead pallor, the eyes were bright </p><p>and alive. </p><p>126 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> “Joke?” he repeated, in Enic’s deep</p><p>Voice, and chuckled again. “I don’t </p><p>joke with you, Katharine.” </p><p> His left hand only remained on the</p><p>controls. His right elbow hooked over </p><p>the back of his seat, and its hand came </p><p>into view—a slender, delicate hand, a </p><p>hand I knew, and upon its back, shin- </p><p>ing in the dimness like touchwood, a </p><p>jagged Z-scar. </p><p> All these details wavered before my</p><p>eyes, like a very old motion picture, but </p><p>I could not deny that they were defi- </p><p>nite. The pilot had changed, had </p><p>melted and run into a travesty of Enic. </p><p>Reason tried to hold command, fran- </p><p>tically and inadequately, like a leader </p><p>against whom tried old troops had re- </p><p>belled. </p><p> Something dawned in my head, a</p><p>saving thought: ectoplasm . . . what </p><p>was it? I had heard of ectoplasm, had </p><p>read of it in Swithin’s books, had </p><p>laughed over a comedy film about it. </p><p>The name of the film was Topper—but </p><p>that was hardly important now. Ecto- </p><p>plasm, the spirit-commanded aura that </p><p>could flow forth, become solid and take </p><p>shape, to form upon a living body the </p><p>strange semblance of a dead person— </p><p>this must be the answer. </p><p> “Who are you?” I asked, knowing</p><p>all the time who it was, and Enic </p><p>chuckled yet again, with almost honest </p><p>mirth. </p><p> “Why do you ask, Katharine?” he</p><p>mocked me, in that soft deep voice that </p><p>I could hear above the roar of the </p><p>motor. “There’s no reason to ask.” </p><p> “What do you want?” I cried, and</p><p>marveled at the hysterical ring of my </p><p>voice in my own ears. </p><p> “You,” he answered. “You, of</p><p>course.” Dead hand lifted to dead face, </p><p>long fingers tapped line-bracketed </p><p>cheek. “Did you think you would ever </p><p>be quit of me ? I died up here, Katha- </p><p>rine. And I waited. You came up, and </p><p>we’re together again.” </p><p> I shrank back, as though he had</p><p>moved to seize me. “But you’re dead,” </p><p>I protested wildly. “And I’m—I’m </p><p>alive!” </p><p> “Yes,” he nodded, as one who con-</p><p>cedes an unimportant item of a discus- </p><p>sion. “Anyway, you aren’t bringing </p><p>Swithin into this.” His lips widened </p><p>in a tigerish grin. “You don’t love him </p><p>as much as you think.” </p><p> “Enic,” I said, and paused to govern</p><p>my voice. I must keep steady, in word </p><p>and in heart and in mind. “Enic, you’re </p><p>wrong. I love Swithin.” </p><p> “And you don’t love me?” His voice</p><p>was suddenly plaintive, offering the </p><p>note that had so often melted my re- </p><p>solve in the past. </p><p> “I can’t love you, Enic. Not now.</p><p>You’re dead,” I cried at him again. </p><p>“The dead can’t love-” </p><p> “Can’t they, though?” His left hand</p><p>crawled over his controls, doing some- </p><p>thing I did not recognize. “I’m dead, </p><p>but I love you. I’ll have you, Kath- </p><p>arine. You’ll see.” </p><p> The ship bucked and leaped around</p><p>us. Suddenly I slid forward in my </p><p>seat, almost fell out of it but for the </p><p>safety belt. </p><p> “What’s happening?” I screamed.</p><p>The motor’s roar rose high, cracked, </p><p>and became a terrifying whine. </p><p> “We’re falling,” said Enic, and still</p><p>his voice could dominate the din. “I’m </p><p>letting us crash, Katharine.” </p><p> “No! No!” I begged.</p><p> “You’ll never feel it,” he told me,</p><p>as though to comfort me. “We’re go- </p><p>ing faster, Katharine—faster—you’ll </p><p>lose your wits, go to sleep—to sleep— </p><p>and when you awaken-”</p><p> That whining wail was the air that</p><p>tore at the struts, I knew. It was quieter </p><p>now, 01* my ears were growing numb. </p><p>THE HIGH PLACES </p><p>127 </p><p>And the pale, stiff face of Enic Graf </p><p>was growing dim, distant. Fog shad- </p><p>owed it. </p><p> “We’ll be together up here in the</p><p>heights,” he was promising me, not </p><p>loudly, but from worlds away. “To- </p><p>gether, Katharine-” </p><p>T was hanging limp against my safety </p><p>belt. It was the only solid thing in </p><p>the universe. And I went deaf, blind. </p><p>I was swallowed by black silence. </p><p> Then a roar, a prickling sensation</p><p>in my toes, and lurid light in my eyes; </p><p>it sounded as though the motor was </p><p>going. And a high, anxious voice was </p><p>dinning at me: “Lady! Lady, are you </p><p>all right?” </p><p> I pawed at my face, sat up straight.</p><p>The plane was traveling on a level once </p><p>more. And the pilot, his heavy hands </p><p>on the controls, was sitting with his thin </p><p>face half over his shoulder. </p><p> “That was a close call,” he told me,</p><p>striving hard to sound cheerful. </p><p> “Was it?” I mumbled idiotically. I</p><p>knew that I looked unkempt, that my </p><p>hat must be askew, my rouge smeared. </p><p>For the moment I did not care. “What </p><p>happened to us?” I demanded. </p><p> “Well, I don’t rightly know,” he</p><p>said, slowly and embarrassedly, like a </p><p>schoolboy unable to recite. “I got up </p><p>above the clouds, ’way up there, and </p><p>tried to level her out—and she kept go- </p><p>ing up.” </p><p> He shook his head and thrust out</p><p>his thin jaw. “Nothing jammed or </p><p>anything, because it’s all right now. But </p><p>she kept going up, up, as if a big hand </p><p>had grabbed us and was lifting us.” </p><p>“Yes,” I prompted. “And then?” </p><p>“Then I seemed to pass out. Maybe </p><p>the air was thin . . . but I didn’t have </p><p>any sense of danger. It was more like </p><p>leaning back while the relief pilot takes </p><p>the controls. Does that sound crazy?”</p><p>“Not very crazy,” I assured him. </p><p>“But you don’t remember what hap- </p><p>pened?” </p><p> “Not a thing,” he confessed. “Not</p><p>until we were falling, and I shook it off </p><p>and pulled us out of the dive.” </p><p> I gazed at him searchingly. “What's</p><p>your name, pilot?” </p><p> “Alvin Piper.” He cleared his</p><p>throat. “If you’re going to make a </p><p>complaint, lady, that’s your privilege. </p><p>But I got a wife and two kids in </p><p>school-” </p><p> “I won’t complain,” I promised. “I</p><p>was wondering, Mr. Piper, if you ever </p><p>knew a pilot named Graf. Enic Graf.” </p><p>“Graf? I don’t think so—no, wait.” </p><p>He nodded fiercely. “I used to know </p><p>a Graf who tested for the Stearman </p><p>people. Had a broken nose, and a big </p><p>scar on his hand.” </p><p> “That’s right,” I agreed.</p><p> We suddenly sailed into a dim clear-</p><p>ness. Moonlight washed the fogged </p><p>windows. </p><p> “Weather’s breaking up already,”</p><p>the pilot informed me with deep satis- </p><p>faction. “That’s Wichita up ahead, </p><p>where the lights are. . . . But what’s </p><p>Enic Graf got to do with this business, </p><p>lady? He died a year ago.” </p><p> “Did he?” I asked, and in spite o£</p><p>myself I laughed shortly. </p><p> The pilot looked at me strangely,</p><p>wonderingly, but I could not tell him </p><p>why I doubted. I could not tell Swithin, </p><p>or my brother Bill. I could not tell </p><p>anyone. </p><p> I knew only that I must never fly</p><p>again, lest Enic be waiting for me in </p><p>the upper abyss. </p><p> my</p><p>By MARY ELIZABETH COUNSELMAN </p><p>A very human story about a little girl in an orphanage, who was considered </p><p>queer by the other children because she claimed that </p><p>her dead mother visited her </p><p> IT W^^T to adopt a child about</p><p>| seven years old,” Mrs. Ellison </p><p>had explained to the matron a </p><p>few hours before. </p><p> Now, standing in the big bare yard</p><p>of the Acipco County Orphanage, she </p><p>studied each of the smaller girls who </p><p>scampered past her. There was a </p><p>chubby dark-curled mite seesawing near </p><p>the tall iron gate, Mrs. Ellison noted. </p><p>A lovely cherub, she thought, who </p><p>would make a wonderful little daughter </p><p>for a childless widow like herself. </p><p>Pumping madly in one of the swings </p><p>was another, brown-eyed and laughing </p><p>as she herself had been at that age. </p><p> So many motherless children, herded</p><p>together like livestock and perforce </p><p>treated almost as such—how was one </p><p>to make the great decision that would </p><p>change one’s own life as well as the </p><p>child’s for ever after today? </p><p> “Good Heavens! I’m shopping for</p><p>a daughter,” the tall gentle-eyed </p><p>woman mused guiltily. “How inhu- </p><p>man! It . ! . it should be the other </p><p>way ’round, if only a child had vision </p><p>enough to select.” </p><p> Her thought snapped off like a twig.</p><p>Something was tugging at her skirt with </p><p>timid insistence, and she peered down, </p><p>startled to find a thin homely little girl </p><p>looking up at her. The penetrating blue </p><p>eyes were much too large for that sal- </p><p>low sensitive face. Two mouse-colored </p><p>braids hung over narrow shoulders </p><p>against the starched collar of her or- </p><p>phanage uniform, and the arm that </p><p>reached up at Mrs. Ellison was match- </p><p>thin and peppered with freckles like </p><p>the face and neck. </p><p> I don’t believe I’ve ever seen a more</p><p>unattractive child, was the woman’s </p><p>first thought. But then the little girl </p><p>smiled, and her face lighted slowly as</p><p>a candle in a dark room. It was a </p><p>sweet strange smile, full of wistfulness </p><p>and yet the paradox of a quiet knowl- </p><p>edge. </p><p> “Are you the lady my mommy sent</p><p>for me?” her small voice piped. It was </p><p>a timid voice, rather vague like the </p><p>blue eyes, but oddly compelling for all </p><p>that. </p><p> Mrs. Ellison knelt down, smiling.</p><p>Her hands moved, smoothing the ratty </p><p>braids. The child wouldn’t look so </p><p>homely with careful attention, her </p><p>thoughts veered, while she murmured </p><p>aloud: </p><p> “I don’t know, sweetheart. Has</p><p>your mommy gone to Heaven?” </p><p> The child regarded her gravely for</p><p>a moment. Then she shook her head. </p><p> “No, ma’m. My mommy comes to</p><p>see me any time I want her to. She </p><p>talks to me every night, an’-” </p><p> At that instant the matron bustled</p><p>up, starched and puffing, a tiny frown </p><p>of annoyance creasing her smooth fore- </p><p>128 </p><p>MOMMY </p><p>129 </p><p>head at sight of the little girl with the </p><p>kneeling woman. </p><p> ‘‘Mrs. Ellison, I’m so sorry I was de-</p><p>layed. . . . Run along to your play, </p><p>Martha dear,” she commanded briskly. </p><p>"Matron wants to talk to the nice lady. </p><p>Run away; that’s a good girl.” </p><p> The visitor rose, puzzled at her tone</p><p>of impatience. But the thin-faced child </p><p>hesitated only a second, during which </p><p>her deep blue eyes searched for some- </p><p>thing in Mrs. Ellison’s expression with </p><p>a solemn intensity. Then she wheeled </p><p>without a word and walked slowly </p><p>away toward a group of children near </p><p>by. At her approach, however, they </p><p>promptly turned and left her standing </p><p>there, leaning against the trunk of a </p><p>giant white oak that dwarfed her small </p><p>body. </p><p>TVTrs. ellison watched the by-play </p><p>with a queer pang. “Who is that </p><p>child?” she murmured. “There’s . . . </p><p>there’s something different about her.” </p><p>“Martha?” The matron’s laugh of </p><p>exasperation knifed into her mood. </p><p>“I'm sure you wouldn't care to take on </p><p>that responsibility! She's really our </p><p>problem child. Doesn't get on with </p><p>the other children and constantly breaks </p><p>our petty rules here. Oh, I don’t mean </p><p>she's deliberately bad, but—” </p><p> “Just a misfit?” The tall brown-</p><p>haired visitor nodded her sympathy. </p><p>“Perhaps it’s the mother’s interference. </p><p>I understand from little Martha that </p><p>she visits her quite often, and that’s </p><p>always hard on a child’s morale. A </p><p>pity she couldn’t just take her away </p><p>from here and support her the best </p><p>way she-” </p><p> Mrs. Ellison broke off, conscious that</p><p>the matron was smiling at her quizzi- </p><p>cally. </p><p> “My dear,” the orphanage head</p><p>spread her hands, “that child has no </p><p>mother—she died over a year ago. Tu-</p><p>berculosis, I’m told, aggravated by </p><p>night work in a cotton mill. I see I </p><p>must explain our little Martha to </p><p>you. . . . </p><p> “The poor baby had such a shock,</p><p>she’s never been able to adjust herself. </p><p>Some minds, tortured beyond endur- </p><p>ance, fall into amnesia as an escape. </p><p>Others—like poor little Martha’s— </p><p>simply build up a dream-world in which </p><p>they need not face the cruel truth. She </p><p>has a positive fixation that her mother </p><p>is beside her at all times. ‘Why, I can </p><p>see her in the night, can’t you?’ she’ll </p><p>say, time and again. Carries on long </p><p>imaginary conversations in the ward </p><p>after lights-out, so that the other chil- </p><p>dren complain of her keeping them </p><p>awake. They don’t dislike her, but I </p><p>think they’re a bit afraid of her.” </p><p> “Afraid?” Mrs. Ellison quirked an</p><p>eyebrow at the absurdity. “Why on </p><p>earth should anyone be afraid of that </p><p>pitiful little mite?” </p><p> The matron fidgeted, then gave a</p><p>nervous laugh. “Well”—she averted </p><p>her gaze sheepishly—“well, it is odd. </p><p>Some unexplainable things have hap- </p><p>pened since the child has been here at </p><p>the Home with us. </p><p> “I must tell you first that Martha’s</p><p>mother was a remarkable woman. </p><p>Physically a wreck, and morally. . . </p><p>There was no father, you understand. </p><p>A drunken sailor, most probably, as the </p><p>woman seems to have been a cheap </p><p>dance-hall hostess before her child was </p><p>born in a charity hospital. </p><p> “But little Martha’s birth seemed to</p><p>bring out the best in her—a fierce ma- </p><p>ternal instinct. It happens often— </p><p>rather proving, I think, the divinity in </p><p>all mankind. Anyway, the mother </p><p>changed her mode of living at once, </p><p>got a job in the mill, and literally killed </p><p>herself working for her child. </p><p>130' </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p> “She fought death with a stubborn</p><p>will that prolonged her life by months, </p><p>they tell me. But in the end her frail </p><p>body gave way. </p><p> “At the last she called little Martha</p><p>to her bedside and made the child some </p><p>sort of crazy promise that she would </p><p>never leave her, no matter what any- </p><p>one said about death and the like. Her </p><p>sick body was only a worn-out coat, she </p><p>told the child, that her real ‘mommy’ </p><p>was throwing away so that it could not </p><p>hinder her any longer in taking care of </p><p>her baby. </p><p> “A natural thing to say, of course,</p><p>but disastrous in its effect on a child’s </p><p>impressionable mind. It developed a </p><p>complex in Martiia ... so weirdly </p><p>borne out by coincidence, however, that </p><p>I ... I sometimes catch myself wonder- </p><p>ing! Really, it’s . . . it’s uncanny!” </p><p>Mrs, ellison laughed softly She </p><p>was a matter-of-fact woman, little </p><p>given to fantasy. But, nettled by her </p><p>skepticism, the matron gave details. </p><p> “You think I’m imagining things?”</p><p>she bridled. “Listen! There was the </p><p>time a certain actress wanted to adopt </p><p>the child. I can’t think why she chose </p><p>homely little Martha—unless as a foil </p><p>for her own beauty. But all was in </p><p>order and Martha was being sent for, </p><p>although she behaved badly and </p><p>screamed all night that her ‘mommy’ </p><p>hadn’t sent this lady for her. </p><p> “With the woman’s secretary wait-</p><p>ing in our very antechamber for Mar- </p><p>tha to be dressed, we received a call </p><p>from the actress’s press agent saying </p><p>the deal was off. It appears she was </p><p>simply adopting Martha as a publicity </p><p>stunt, to swing public opinion her way </p><p>when a nasty scandal broke in which </p><p>her name would be involved. But that </p><p>very morning she had fallen downstairs </p><p>md fractured her nose!. In case the </p><p>plastic surgery wasn’t successful, her </p><p>agent informed me, the dear lady’s con- </p><p>tract might not be renewed and ‘she</p><p>couldn’t support a child.’ We read </p><p>between the lines, of course, as the </p><p>actress had millions salted away. . * . </p><p> “But there it stands. Martha was</p><p>saved from such an adoption because </p><p>something tripped that cold-blooded </p><p>woman and temporarily marred her </p><p>looks I” </p><p> Mrs. Ellison gave another soft</p><p>laugh. “A timely coincidence,” she </p><p>murmured. “Poor little Martha 1” </p><p> “Yes,” the matron nodded wryly.</p><p>“But it strengthened her belief that her </p><p>‘mommy’ was watching over her inter- </p><p>ests night and day! As for the other </p><p>children here, they’re as convinced as </p><p>she is . . . especially since the time that </p><p>circus came to town, and our amuse- </p><p>ment fund didn’t stretch over the last </p><p>ten of our enrollment. </p><p> “Martha was one of those who drew</p><p>lots and lost. She was heartbroken, </p><p>like the other nine losers. Then sud- </p><p>denly, as I was lining up those who </p><p>could go, little Martha ran forward and </p><p>tugged at my arm. </p><p> “ ‘Matron ! Matron!’ she cried, her</p><p>eyes shining with excitement. ‘Mommy </p><p>says I can go! Mommy says to take </p><p>all the others, and she’ll pay their way </p><p>somehow, so I can go!’ </p><p> “Of course, that outburst upset the</p><p>other children and raised their hopes </p><p>so, I hadn’t the heart to leave them </p><p>behind. I decided to borrow the differ- </p><p>ence from our food bill and juggle ac- </p><p>counts later. A foolhardy impulse, but </p><p>you’ll understand how I felt. </p><p> “So off they went to the circus, every</p><p>one of them. They were fairly dancing </p><p>with anticipation waiting outside the </p><p>big tent while I bought the tickets; but </p><p>my conscience was beginning to prickle. </p><p>Those ten extra tickets meant a scantier </p><p>MOMMY </p><p>131 </p><p>diet for all of them well into the next </p><p>month’s budget, and I was sure the </p><p>board would discover it and give me a </p><p>severe reprimand. </p><p> “I stopped short right there, think-</p><p>ing it over and wishing heartily that I </p><p>could spank little Martha. But at that </p><p>moment I ... I happened to glance </p><p>down at the sawdust. </p><p> “There just under my foot was a</p><p>small wad of paper money neatly </p><p>folded around some silver change. My </p><p>heart almost stopped, let me tell you, </p><p>when I counted it—the exact amount, </p><p>to a penny, for those ten tickets! I had </p><p>the local paper advertise later for its </p><p>loser, but no one claimed it. I’ve . . . </p><p>I’ve often speculated on the many ways </p><p>it could have got there.” </p><p> Mrs. Ellison’s smile had faded a</p><p>trifle, but now it came back, full of </p><p>gentle tolerance. “Perhaps some </p><p>drunken person dropped it,” she sug- </p><p>gested. “Surely, my dear matron, </p><p>there’s nothing supernatural about los- </p><p>ing money on a circus ground 1” </p><p> “Humph! Oh. Well . . . maybe</p><p>not.” The plump orphanage head </p><p>looked disgruntled but unconvinced. </p><p>“There were other times,” she pur- </p><p>sued stoutly. “That time, for instance, </p><p>when little Martha swallowed an open </p><p>safety-pin, the way children will do if </p><p>you don’t watch them every minute ! </p><p> “It was a terrible day last fall, when</p><p>we had that ice storm, you remember. </p><p>Wires were down, and we couldn’t lo- </p><p>cate a doctor, with the poor little thing </p><p>choking and crying, and that open pin </p><p>jabbing into her throat with every move </p><p>she’d make! I was frantic, and Miss </p><p>Peebles, our resident nurse, was at her </p><p>wit’s end . . . when all of a sudden this </p><p>interstate bus broke down, spang in </p><p>front of the Home gate. . . </p><p> Mrs. Ellison’s eyes twinkled faintly.</p><p>“And I suppose,” she put in, teasingly, </p><p>“there was a doctor for little Martha</p><p>on the bus?” </p><p>rpHE matron did not return her smile, </p><p> but surreptitiously mopped off a dew</p><p>of moisture that sprang to her upper </p><p>lip at the memory. </p><p> “A doctor?” she replied grimly.</p><p>“There were eight — coming home </p><p>from the state medical convention! One </p><p>was an ear, eye, nose and throat special- </p><p>ist. Of course, he had that safety-pin </p><p>out in a jiffy. </p><p> “What was so queer, the bus driver</p><p>said it was battery trouble, with his </p><p>new battery and wiring just checked </p><p>carefully at the last station! Oh, it </p><p>could happen, yes. I grant you, it could </p><p>happen.” </p><p> Mrs. Ellison chuckled. The chuckle</p><p>seemed to annoy the matron, and she </p><p>burst out afresh. </p><p> “There are dozens of minor inci-</p><p>dents like that,” she declared. “Martha </p><p>is eternally finding things the other chil- </p><p>dren will pass a hundred times. Pennies </p><p>in the grass. A half-package of gum. </p><p>A broken toy fire-engine, once, that </p><p>some child must have thrown over the </p><p>Home fence in a temper.

If I scold her and tell her </p><p>to say she found it, she’ll just say: ‘Oh, </p><p>yes—but Mommy told me where it </p><p>was.’ </p><p> “All that has made a vast impres-</p><p>sion on the other children.

Why, it’s medieval!” </p><p> The orphanage head folded her lips</p><p>primly. “Well,” she said in a tone that </p><p>defied argument, “I only say it’s queer, </p><p>and that’s what it is!

It’s a cry- </p><p>ing shame—but who’d want a crazy </p><p>child when there are so many normal </p><p>ones to be had?” </p><p> She followed the visitor’s gaze with</p><p>a look of perplexity, and regarded the </p><p>little girl sitting cross-legged on the </p><p>ground, playing by herself while others </p><p>scampered past in noisy groups. </p><p> But Mrs. Ellison was folding her</p><p>gloves and putting them in her purse </p><p>with the gesture of a knight drawing on </p><p>his gauntlets of chain-mail. Then she </p><p>faced the matron and announced: </p><p>“Who’d want her? / do ! And just as </p><p>soon as it can be arranged! That fixa- </p><p>tion has been nourished too long in the </p><p>child’s mind. But a home, some new </p><p>toys and a little affection will make her </p><p>forget that nonsense. So ... if you’ll </p><p>just rush the formalities, I’d be ever so </p><p>grateful.” </p><p> The matron blinked at her, surprised</p><p>for a moment, a tiny flicker of doubt </p><p>burning behind her spectacles. Then she </p><p>shrugged and sighed deeply.	✓</p><p> “That I will!” was her promise. “I</p><p>only hope you won’t regret it, Mrs. El- </p><p>lison. Frankly, I haven’t been able to </p><p>cope with the situation. It’s . . . it’s a </p><p>strange case, and needs a lot of under- </p><p>standing. Don’t be too impatient with </p><p>the child.”</p><p> “Nonsense!” The visitor squared</p><p>her shoulders firmly. “Martha simply </p><p>needs a mother.” And she strode across </p><p>the grounds toward the small figure </p><p>playing alone under the oak tree with a </p><p>handful of acorn cups. </p><p> The matron, watching her, shook</p><p>her head doubtfully as Mrs. Ellison </p><p>knelt beside the child. Then, with re- </p><p>luctance, she turned away, for there </p><p>were some two hundred other orphans </p><p>who demanded her daily attention. </p><p>T ittle martha looked up shyly, </p><p>gravely questioning. Mrs. Ellison </p><p>studied the vague sweet smile accorded </p><p>her and gathered the child impulsively </p><p>into her arms. But she was chagrined </p><p>at the lack of response. Little Martha, </p><p>not quite cold to her advance, was like </p><p>a small bony doll in her embrace, </p><p>neither affectionate nor defiant. One </p><p>hand clutched an acorn cup with a tiny </p><p>grass handle, but the other hung limp </p><p>and did not steal about her neck as </p><p>Mrs. Ellison had half expected. It was </p><p>almost a challenge, she thought, and </p><p>smiled at the absurdity. </p><p> “Martha dear,” she whispered, “you</p><p>are going home with me and be my lit- </p><p>tle girl. I’ll give you a pony and cart, </p><p>and lots of dollies, and have your hair </p><p>curled like that little girl over there. </p><p>Would you like that?” </p><p> The blue eyes lighted, giving</p><p>Martha’s sallow face a certain quaint </p><p>beauty for all its freckles and angular- </p><p>ity. </p><p> “Oh, yes’m!” she breathed. “I . . ,</p><p>I would! But I’ll have to ask Mommy </p><p>first,” she added shyly. “Tonight I </p><p>guess maybe she’ll tell me if you’re the </p><p>one.” </p><p> “Now, now!” Mrs. Ellison laughed</p><p>with an effort. “You must call me your </p><p>MOMMY </p><p>133 </p><p>mommy, dear, because you’ll be my </p><p>own little girl tomorrow!” </p><p> “Yes’m,” the grave child nodded</p><p>obediently, “I’ll call you Mother, if </p><p>Mommy says it’s all right. Oh, I . . . </p><p>I do hope you’re the one!” </p><p> And Mrs. Ellison left, feeling baf-</p><p>fled and entirely unsure whether or not </p><p>she had won that first match. </p><p> The ponderous amount of red tape</p><p>was snipped through, true to the ma- </p><p>tron’s promise. A few days later, with </p><p>a late autumn sun gilding .the yellow </p><p>leaves a brighter gold, Mrs. Ellison </p><p>again drove to the Acipco County Or- </p><p>phanage. </p><p> She had dismissed her chauffeur,</p><p>bought a woolly Sealyham pup at a pet </p><p>shop en route, as well as a lovely little </p><p>blue silk dress, and set forth rather </p><p>grimly. These, she thought, are my </p><p>weapons. With these I will lay for ever </p><p>the ghost of Martha’s “mommy,” and </p><p>she’ll haunt that lonely child no longer! </p><p> An hour later, they w’ere whirling</p><p>out of the orphanage driveway—a tall </p><p>gentle-eyed woman at the steering- </p><p>wheel and, close beside her, a little girl </p><p>in a blue dress, ecstatically hugging her </p><p>new puppy. </p><p> Threading her way through the</p><p>afternoon traffic, Mrs. Ellison smiled </p><p>and chatted merrily, but her heart </p><p>seethed. Confound that selfish hyster- </p><p>ical woman, dying on her hospital cot! </p><p>She had left a mark on this wistful </p><p>credulous baby that time could not </p><p>erase! </p><p> For a moment, glancing sidewise at</p><p>her adopted daughter, Martha’s second </p><p>mother hated that first one who stood </p><p>between them like an invisible wall, in </p><p>spite of everything she could do. </p><p> Or, did she? Eerily Mrs. Ellison felt</p><p>an alien presence in that wide car seat </p><p>—but not between her and the child. </p><p>Rather, it seemed that someone . , .</p><p>something . . . was seated on the other </p><p>side of little Martha, allied with her </p><p>new mother, guarding the child on one </p><p>side while she herself guarded the </p><p>other. </p><p> The tall woman shook herself an-</p><p>grily. What utter rot! Was she, too, </p><p>succumbing to the child’s hallucination? </p><p>She must exorcise that spirit now, or </p><p>admit defeat by something that did not </p><p>exist. </p><p> “Do you love your new mommy?”</p><p>she coaxed, bending sidewise to hug lit- </p><p>tle Martha with one arm. </p><p> The child snuggled closer. Wide blue</p><p>eyes blazed up at her, aglow with hap- </p><p>piness. “Oh, yes, Mother! You are </p><p>really and truly my mother now, aren’t </p><p>you? So I’ll tell you a secret,” as the </p><p>woman’s face lighted with triumph. </p><p>“Mommy told me last night that she </p><p>picked you out for me a long, long time </p><p>ago ! An’ she said-” </p><p> “Martha!” Mrs. Ellison drew back</p><p>sharply as from an unexpected blow. </p><p>“Stop talking like that!” she com- </p><p>manded shortly. “I want you to forget </p><p>all that nonsense about your mother, </p><p>Remember and love her always, of </p><p>course. But your mommy went to </p><p>Heaven over a year ago, and you must </p><p>stop pretending that-” </p><p>A scream from the child cut her </p><p>short. Mrs. Ellison broke off, </p><p>jerked her head around, and was trans- </p><p>fixed with horror to see a huge and </p><p>driverless gasoline truck hurtling down </p><p>upon them from the long narrow hill </p><p>they were slowly ascending. </p><p> The great red juggernaut was pick-</p><p>ing up speed. It careened from curb to </p><p>curb like a drunken monster, making </p><p>for their car with a blood-chilling ac- </p><p>curacy, blunt-nosed and heavy as a lo- </p><p>comotive. </p><p> Panic swept over Mrs. Ellison,</p><p>134 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>* </p><p>freezing her hands to the steering- </p><p>wheel. A few more yards, and disas- </p><p>ter would strike them head-on with a </p><p>grinding crash. It seemed to the woman </p><p>that she could hear that sickening sound </p><p>already . . . and there was not an alley, </p><p>not a convenient driveway for them to </p><p>dart into. Only a low rock wall on </p><p>one side, a sloping terrace on the other. </p><p>And, as though realizing the futility of </p><p>further motion, the car stalled dead in </p><p>the path of the runaway truck. </p><p> darling—jump!” Mrs. Elli-</p><p> ^ son screamed. Jump out and</p><p>run! I ... I can’t-” </p><p> But the child at her side had not</p><p>even heard her. For one who faced </p><p>death, she seemed strangely calm. Her </p><p>sallow face had gone so pale that the </p><p>freckles stood out darkly, and her grip </p><p>on the new puppy tightened. But her </p><p>lips moved softly in a half-prayer that </p><p>was almost inaudible to the woman </p><p>beside her. </p><p> “Mommy! Mom-my !” the whisper</p><p>fairly screamed. “Make it stop, </p><p>Mommy! Please make it stop!” </p><p> Mrs. Ellison tugged at the child, in-</p><p>tent on pulling her out of the doomed </p><p>car in a last wild chance at safety. But </p><p>before she could wrench open the car </p><p>door . . . there was a metallic squeal of </p><p>stripped gears. </p><p> Looking up, wild-eyed, she saw the</p><p>onrushing truck hop sidewise awk- </p><p>wardly and come to a scraping halt </p><p>against the curb — a scant five feet </p><p>above them. </p><p> People came running then—fright-</p><p>ened residents, and a policeman, and </p><p>the white-faced truck-driver. They </p><p>crowded about the truck, then rushed </p><p>to the stalled car where Mrs. Ellison </p><p>was slumped weakly at the wheel. Be- </p><p>side her sat a homely little girl whose</p><p>strange quiet smile caused them to look </p><p>at her and look again intently. </p><p> “Jeez, lady!” the truck-driver bab-</p><p>bled an incoherent apology. “I sure </p><p>thought I had her braked steady! Jeep- </p><p>ers, if that packing-case on the seat </p><p>hadn’t a-fell against the gear-shift and </p><p>knocked her into reverse, you . . . you </p><p>might a-been---” </p><p> Mrs. Ellison merely nodded in an-</p><p>swer. She could not trust her voice. </p><p>She could only stare in a dazed way at </p><p>the truck, then shift her gaze queerly </p><p>to the little girl seated beside her. </p><p> “Are . . . you quite all right, Martha</p><p>dear?” she whispered after a moment. </p><p>“Then, let’s you and I and . . . and </p><p>Mommy go along home.” </p><p>Will- o’-the-Wisp </p><p> By CHARLES SLOAN REID</p><p> Through wood and fen where elves delight</p><p> To stage a dance or time a race,</p><p> A witch’s lantern flares tonight</p><p> To lead my feet a merry chase.</p><p>Uhe </p><p>By H. P. LOVECPvAFT </p><p>A brief posthumous tale by a master of eery fiction </p><p>I WAS shown into the attic cham- </p><p>ber by a grave, intelligent-looking </p><p>man with quiet clothes and an </p><p>iron-gray beard, who spoke to me in </p><p>this fashion: </p><p> “Yes, he lived here—but I don’t</p><p>advise your doing anything. Your curi- </p><p>osity makes you irresponsible. We </p><p>never come here at night, and it’s only </p><p>because of his will that we keep it this </p><p>way. You know what he did. That </p><p>abominable society took charge at last, </p><p>and we don’t know where he is buried. </p><p>There was no way the law or anything </p><p>else could reach the society. </p><p> “I hope you won’t stay till after</p><p>dark. And I beg of you to let that </p><p>thing on the table—the thing that looks </p><p>like a match-box—alone. We don’t </p><p>know what it is, but we suspect it has </p><p>something to do with what he did. We </p><p>even avoid looking at it very steadily.” </p><p>After a time the man left me alone </p><p>in the attic room. It was very dingy </p><p>and dusty, and only primitively fur- </p><p>nished, but it had a neatness which </p><p>showed it was not a slum-denizen’s </p><p>quarters. There were shelves full of </p><p>theological and classical books, and </p><p>another bookcase containing treatises </p><p>on magic—Paracelsus, Albertus Mag- </p><p>nus, Trithemius, Hermes Trismegistus, </p><p>Borellus, and others in strange alpha- </p><p>bets whose titles I could not decipher. </p><p>The furniture was very plain. There </p><p>was a door, but it led only into a closet. </p><p>The only egress was the aperture in </p><p>the floor up to which the crude, steep </p><p>staircase led. The windows were of </p><p>bull’s-eye pattern, and the black oak </p><p>beams bespoke unbelievable antiquity. </p><p>Plainly, this house was of the Old </p><p>World. I seemed to know where I was, </p><p>but cannot recall what I then knew. </p><p>Certainly, the town was not London. </p><p>My impression is of a small seaport. </p><p> The small object on the table fas-</p><p>cinated me intensely. I seemed to know </p><p>what to do with it, for I drew a pocket</p><p>electric light—or what looked like one </p><p>—out of my pocket and nervously </p><p>tested its flashes. The light was not </p><p>white but violet, and seemed less like </p><p>true light than like some radio-active </p><p>bombardment. I recall that I did not </p><p>regard it as a common flashlight—in- </p><p>deed, I had a common flashlight in </p><p>another pocket. </p><p> It was getting dark, and the ancient</p><p>roofs and chimney-pots outside looked </p><p>very queer through the bull’s-eye win- </p><p>dow-panes. Finally I summoned up </p><p>courage and propped the small object </p><p>up on the table against a book—then </p><p>turned the rays of the peculiar violet </p><p>light upon it. The light seemed now </p><p>to be more like a rain or hail of small </p><p>violet particles than like a continuous </p><p>beam. As the particles struck the </p><p>glassy surface at the center of the </p><p>strange device, they seemed to produce </p><p>a crackling noise like the sputtering of </p><p>a vacuum tube through which sparks </p><p>are passed. The dark glassy surface </p><p>135 </p><p>136 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>displayed a pinkish glow, and a vague </p><p>white shape seemed to be taking form </p><p>at its center. Then I noticed that I was </p><p>not alone in the room—and put the </p><p>ray-projector back in my pocket. </p><p> But the newcomer did not speak—</p><p>nor did I hear any sound whatever </p><p>during all the immediately following </p><p>moments. Everything was shadowy </p><p>pantomime, as if seen at a vast distance </p><p>through some intervening haze—al- </p><p>though 011 the other hand the new- </p><p>comer and all subsequent comers, </p><p>loomed large and close, as if both near </p><p>and distant, according to some abnor- </p><p>mal geometry. </p><p>The newcomer was a thin, dark man </p><p>of medium height attired in the </p><p>clerical garb of the Anglican church. </p><p>He was apparently about thirty years </p><p>old, with a sallow, olive complexion and </p><p>fairly good features, but an abnormally </p><p>high forehead. His black hair was well </p><p>cut and neatly brushed, and he was </p><p>clean-shaven though blue-chinned with </p><p>a heavy growth of beard. He wore </p><p>rimless spectacles with steel bows. His </p><p>build and lower facial features were </p><p>like other clergymen I had seen, but he </p><p>had a vastly higher forehead, and was </p><p>darker and more intelligent-looking— </p><p>also more subtly and concealedly evil- </p><p>looking. At the present moment—hav- </p><p>ing just lighted a faint oil lamp—he </p><p>looked nervous, and before I knew it </p><p>he was casting all his magical books </p><p>into a fireplace on the window side of </p><p>the room (where the wall slanted </p><p>sharply) which I had not noticed </p><p>before. The flames devoured the </p><p>volumes greedily —■ leaping up in </p><p>strange colors and emitting indescrib- </p><p>ably hideous odors as the strangely </p><p>hieroglyphed leaves and wormy bind- </p><p>ings succumbed to the devastating ele- </p><p>ment. All at once I saw there were </p><p>others in the room—grave-looking men </p><p>in clerical costume, one of whom wore </p><p>the bands and knee-breeches of a </p><p>bishop. Though I could hear nothing, </p><p>I could see that they were bringing a </p><p>decision of vast import to the first-</p><p>comer. They seemed to hate and fear </p><p>him at the same time., and he seemed </p><p>to return these sentiments. His face </p><p>set itself into a grim expression, but I </p><p>could see his right hand shaking as he </p><p>tried to grip the back of a chair. The </p><p>bishop pointed to the empty case and </p><p>to the fireplace (where the flames had </p><p>died down amidst a charred, non-com- </p><p>mittal mass), and seemed filled with a </p><p>peculiar loathing. The first-comer </p><p>then gave a wry smile and reached </p><p>out with his left hand toward the small </p><p>object on the table. Everyone then </p><p>seemed frightened. The procession of </p><p>clerics began filing down the steep </p><p>stairs through the trap-door in the </p><p>floor, turning and making menacing </p><p>gestures as they left. The bishop was </p><p>last to go. </p><p> The first-comer now went to a cup-</p><p>board on the inner side of the room </p><p>and extracted a coil of rope. Mounting </p><p>a chair, he attached one end of the </p><p>rope to a hook in the great exposed </p><p>central beam of black oak, and began </p><p>making a noose with the other end. </p><p>Realizing he was about to hang him- </p><p>self, I started forward to dissuade or </p><p>save him. He saw me and ceased his </p><p>preparations, looking at me with a kind </p><p>of triumph which puzzled and dis- </p><p>turbed me. He slowly stepped down </p><p>from the chair and began gliding to- </p><p>ward me with a positively wolfish grin </p><p>on his dark, thin-lipped face. </p><p> I felt somehow in deadly peril, and</p><p>drew out the peculiar ray-projector as </p><p>a weapon of defense. Why I thought </p><p>it could help me, I do not know. I </p><p>burned it 011—full in his face, and saw </p><p>THE WICKED CLERGYMAN </p><p>137 </p><p>the sallow features glow first with </p><p>violet and then with pinkish light. His </p><p>expression of wolfish exultation began </p><p>to be crowded aside by a look of pro- </p><p>found fear—which did not, however, </p><p>wholly displace the exultation. He </p><p>stopped in his tracks—then, flailing his </p><p>arms wildly in the air, began to stagger </p><p>backward. I saw he was edging to- </p><p>ward the open stair-well in the floor, </p><p>and tried to shout a warning, but he </p><p>did not hear me. In another instant he </p><p>had lurched backward through the </p><p>opening and was lost to view. </p><p> I found difficulty in moving toward</p><p>the stair-well, but when I did get there </p><p>I found no crushed body on the floor </p><p>below. Instead there was a clatter of </p><p>people coming up with lanterns, for </p><p>the spell of phantasmal silence had </p><p>broken, and I once more heard sounds </p><p>and saw figures as normally tri-dimen- </p><p>sional. Something had evidently drawn </p><p>a crowd to this place. Had there been </p><p>a noise I had not heard? Presently the </p><p>two people (simple villagers, appar- </p><p>ently) farthest in the lead saw me— </p><p>and stood paralyzed. One of them </p><p>shrieked loudly and reverberandy: </p><p> “Ahrrrh !... It be 'ee. zur? Again?”</p><p> Then they all turned and fled fran-</p><p>tically. All, that is, but one. When </p><p>the crowd was gone I saw the grave- </p><p>bearded man who had brought me to </p><p>this place—standing alone with a lan- </p><p>tern. He was gazing at me gaspingly </p><p>and fascinatedly, but did not seem </p><p>afraid. Then he began to ascend the </p><p>stairs, and joined me in the attic. He </p><p>spoke: </p><p> “So you didn’t let it alone! I’m</p><p>sorry. I know what has happened. It </p><p>happened once before, but the man got </p><p>frightened and shot himself. You </p><p>ought not to have made him come back. </p><p>You know what he wants. But you </p><p>mustn’t get frightened like the other </p><p>man he got. Something very strange </p><p>and terrible has happened to you, but </p><p>it didn’t get far enough to hurt your</p><p>mind and personality. If you’ll keep </p><p>cool, and accept the need for making </p><p>certain radical readjustments in your </p><p>life, you can keep right on enjoying the </p><p>world, and the fruits of your scholar- </p><p>ship. But you can t live here—and I </p><p>don’t think you'll wish to go back to </p><p>London. I’d advise America. </p><p> “You mustn't try anything more with</p><p>that—thing. Nothing can be put back </p><p>now. It would only make matters </p><p>worse to do—or summon—anything. </p><p>You are not as badly off as you might </p><p>be—but you must get out of here at </p><p>once and stay away. You’d better thank </p><p>Heaven it didn’t go further. . . - </p><p> “I’m going to prepare you as bluntly</p><p>as I can. There’s been a certain </p><p>change—in your personal appearance. </p><p>He always causes that. But in a new </p><p>country you can get used to it. There’s </p><p>a mirror up at the other end of the </p><p>room, and I’m going to take you to it. </p><p>You’ll get a shock—though yau will </p><p>see nothing repulsive.” </p><p>T was now shaking with deadly fear, </p><p>and the bearded man almost had </p><p>to hold me up as he walked me across </p><p>the room to the mirror, the faint lamp </p><p>(i. e., that formerly on the table, not </p><p>the still fainter lantern he had brought) </p><p>in his free hand. This is what I saw </p><p>in the glass: </p><p> A thin, dark man of medium stature</p><p>attired in the clerical garb of the Angli- </p><p>can church, apparently about thirty, </p><p>and with rimless, steel-bowed glasses </p><p>glistening beneath a sallow, olive fore- </p><p>head of abnormal height. </p><p> It was the silent first-comer who had</p><p>burned his books. </p><p> For all the rest of my life, in out-</p><p>ward form, I was to be that man! </p><p>pedal News Bulletin </p><p>By VINCENT GADDIS </p><p>A short weird tale of radio and a passenger air-liner </p><p>Doctor edward cran- </p><p>j DON stepped from the taxi. </p><p>Lightning flashed.

Its mo- </p><p>tors were roaring.

But the convention was </p><p>only a few hours away, and his ner- </p><p>vousness would vanish. </p><p> He settled back against the cushions</p><p>and glanced at the other passengers: a </p><p>middle-aged man reading a newspaper </p><p>—a laughing couple, talking softly—a </p><p>lady, rather old, wiping her eyes—a </p><p>young man writing on the back of an </p><p>envelope—a girl using her compact. </p><p> The lights flashed out.

Shang- </p><p>hai had been taken the night Kellar, </p><p>his heart-disease patient, died. Weeks </p><p>ago. </p><p> Suddenly Doctor Crandon recalled</p><p>reading a scientific theory. Every </p><p>sound that has ever been made is still </p><p>vibrating in the ether. Every radio </p><p>program is still in existence in space. </p><p>The noises of long-dead history might </p><p>some day be captured.

The hum faded into music— </p><p>weird music, unlike anything he had </p><p>ever heard. The music stopped. Clear, </p><p>penetrating, came an announcement: </p><p>“Special news flash.

Doctor Crandon was</p><p>listening to broadcasts that were yet to </p><p>be made! Time—the fourth dimen- </p><p>sion. Time—extending into space like </p><p>length and breadth. The events of the </p><p>future really existed somewhere, and </p><p>due to some freakish law of nature,</p><p>some unknown condition of cosmic </p><p>forces in the air, it was possible for </p><p>him to tune in on tomorrow.

The </p><p>old lady was staring into space—the </p><p>couple were still talking—the middle- </p><p>aged man was sleeping—the young </p><p>man was reading a magazine—the girl </p><p>was working on her fingernails. The </p><p>secret was his—alone. </p><p> A cold paralysis gripped him. He</p><p>was on the edge of the great unknown. </p><p>He must listen. Stock market reports. </p><p>Race results. The tide of wars. New </p><p>discoveries. He could make millions, </p><p>be a prophet, a great inventor. He </p><p>slowly turned the dial, listened. </p><p> Suddenly the roaring motors died. A</p><p>series of jolts. The plane was landing. </p><p>So soon? Doctor Crandon looked at </p><p>his watch. Eight-thirty. The hostess </p><p>appeared, smiling. The passengers </p><p>arose and prepared to leave. </p><p> It was dark outside. Doctor Cran-</p><p>don reached for the blind, but the hos- </p><p>tess caught his arm. </p><p> “Wait,” she said.</p><p> Still smiling, she opened the top of</p><p>the radio, turned something inside, </p><p>jerked a wire. A voice boomed into </p><p>the earphones. Doctor Crandon stiff- </p><p>ened as he listened to the words: </p><p> “Special news bulletin.

B. BISHOP </p><p>IN 1925 I went into Oklahoma </p><p>looking for snake lore, and I came </p><p>out with a fear of snakes that will </p><p>last me the rest of my life. I admit it </p><p>is foolish, since there are natural ex- </p><p>planations for everything I saw and </p><p>heard, but it masters me none the less. </p><p>If the old story had been all there was </p><p>to it, I would not have been so badly </p><p>shaken. My work as an American Indi- </p><p>an ethnologist has hardened me to all </p><p>kinds of extravagant legendry, and I </p><p>know that simple white people can beat </p><p>the redskins at their own game when it </p><p>comes to fanciful inventions. But I can’t </p><p>forget what I saw with my own eyes at </p><p>the insane asylum in Guthrie. </p><p> I called at that asylum because a few</p><p>of the oldest settlers told me I would </p><p>find something important there. Neither </p><p>Indians nor white men would discuss </p><p>the snake-god legends I had come to </p><p>trace. The oil-boom newcomers, of </p><p>course, knew nothing of such matters, </p><p>and the red men and old pioneers were </p><p>plainly frightened when I spoke of </p><p>* From WEIRD TALES for November, 1929. </p><p>140	v</p><p>them. Not more than six or seven peo- </p><p>ple mentioned the asylum, and those </p><p>who did were careful to talk in whis- </p><p>pers. But the whisperers said that Dr. </p><p>McNeill could show me a very terrible </p><p>relic and tell me all I wanted to know. </p><p>He could explain why Yig, the half- </p><p>human father of serpents, is a shunned </p><p>and feared object in central Oklahoma, </p><p>and why old settlers shiver at the se- </p><p>cret Indian orgies which make the au- </p><p>tumn days and nights hideous with the </p><p>ceaseless beating of tom-toms in lonely </p><p>places. </p><p> It was with the scent of a hound on</p><p>the trail that I went to Guthrie, for I </p><p>had spent many years collecting data </p><p>on the evolution of serpent-worship </p><p>among the Indians. I had always felt, </p><p>from well-defined undertones of legend </p><p>and archeology, that great Quetzal- </p><p>coatl—benign snake-god of the Mexi-</p><p>cans—had had an older and darker </p><p>prototype; and during recent months </p><p>I had well-nigh proved it in a series of </p><p>researches stretching from Guatemala </p><p>to the Oklahoma plains. But everything </p><p>THE CURSE OF YIG </p><p>141 </p><p>was tantalizing and incomplete, for </p><p>above the border the cult of the snake </p><p>was hedged about by fear and furt- </p><p>iveness. </p><p> Now it appeared that a new and</p><p>copious source of data was about to </p><p>dawn, and I sought the head of the </p><p>asylum with an eagerness I did not try </p><p>to cloak. Doctor McNeill was a small </p><p>clean-shaven man of somew'hat ad- </p><p>vanced years, and I saw at once from </p><p>his speech and manner that he was a </p><p>scholar of no mean attainments in many </p><p>branches outside his profession. Grave </p><p>and doubtful when I first made known </p><p>my errand, his face grew thoughtful as </p><p>he carefully scanned my credentials and </p><p>the letter of introduction which a kindly </p><p>old ex-Indian agent had given me. </p><p> “So you’ve been studying the Yig-</p><p>legend, eh?” he reflected sententiously. </p><p>“I know that many of our Oklahoma </p><p>ethnologists have tried to connect it </p><p>with Quctzalcoatl, but I don’t think any </p><p>of them have traced the intermediate </p><p>steps so well. You’ve done remarkable </p><p>work for a man as young as you seem </p><p>to be, and you certainly deserve all the </p><p>data we can give. </p><p> “I don’t suppose old Major Moore</p><p>or any of the others told you what it </p><p>is I have here. They don’t like to talk </p><p>about it, and neither do I. It is very </p><p>tragic and very horrible, but that is all. </p><p>I refuse to consider it anything super- </p><p>natural. There’s a story about it that </p><p>I’ll tell you after you see it—a devilish </p><p>sad story, but one that I won’t call </p><p>magic. It merely shows the potency diat </p><p>belief has over some people. I’ll admit </p><p>there are times when I feel a shiver </p><p>that’s more than physical, but in day- </p><p>light I set all that down to nerves. I'm </p><p>not a young fellow any more, alas! </p><p> “To come to the point, the thing I</p><p>have is what you might call a victim </p><p>of Yig’s curse—a physically living vic- </p><p>tim. We don’t let the bulk of the nur- </p><p>ses see it, although most of them know </p><p>it’s here. There are just two steady old</p><p>chaps whom I let feed it and clean out </p><p>its quarters—used to be three, but good </p><p>old Stevens passed on a few years ago. </p><p>I suppose I’ll have to break in a new </p><p>group pretty soon; for the thing does </p><p>not seem to age or change much, and </p><p>we old boys can’t last for ever. Maybe </p><p>the ethics of the near future will let us </p><p>give it a merciless release, but it’s hard </p><p>to tell. </p><p> “Did you see that single ground-</p><p>glass basement window over in the east </p><p>wing when you came up the drive? </p><p>That's where it is. I'll take you there </p><p>myself now. You needn’t make any </p><p>comment. Just look through the mov- </p><p>able panel in the door and thank God </p><p>the light isn’t any stronger. Then I’ll </p><p>tell you the story—or as much as I’ve </p><p>been able to piece together.” </p><p>WE walked downstairs very quiedy, </p><p>and did not talk as we threaded </p><p>the corridors of the seemingly deserted </p><p>basement. Doctor McNeill unlocked a </p><p>gray-painted steel door, but it was only </p><p>a bulkhead leading to a further stretch </p><p>of hallway. At length he paused before </p><p>a door marked B 116, opened a small </p><p>observation panel which he could use </p><p>only by standing on tiptoe, and pounded </p><p>several times upon the painted metal, </p><p>as if to arouse the occupant, whatever </p><p>it might be. </p><p> A faint stench came from the aper-</p><p>ture as the doctor unclosed it, and I </p><p>fancied his pounding elicited a kind </p><p>of low, hissing response. Finally he </p><p>motioned me to replace him at the peep- </p><p>hole, and I did so with a causeless and </p><p>increasing tremor. The barred, ground- </p><p>glass window, close to the earth outside, </p><p>admitted only a feeble and uncertain </p><p>pallorj and I had to look into the malo- </p><p>142 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>dorous den for several seconds before </p><p>I could see what was crawling and </p><p>wriggling about on the straw-covered </p><p>floor, emitting every now and then a </p><p>weak and vacuous hiss. Then the shad- </p><p>owed outlines began to take shape, and </p><p>I perceived that the squirming entity </p><p>bore some remote resemblance to a hu- </p><p>man form laid flat on its belly. I </p><p>clutched at the door-handle for support </p><p>as I tried to. keep from fainting. </p><p> The moving object was almost of</p><p>human size, and entirely devoid of </p><p>clothing. It was absolutely hairless, </p><p>and its tawny-looking back seemed </p><p>subtly squamous in the dim, ghoulish </p><p>light. </p><p> Around the shoulders it was rather</p><p>speckled and brownish, and the head </p><p>was very curiously flat. As it looked </p><p>up to hiss at me I saw' that the </p><p>beady little black eyes were damnably </p><p>anthropoid, but I could not bear to </p><p>study them long. They fastened them- </p><p>selves on me with a horrible persis- </p><p>tence, so that I closed the panel gasp- </p><p>ingly and left the creature to wriggle </p><p>about unseen in its matted straw and </p><p>spectral twilight. I must have reeled a </p><p>bit, for I saw that the doctor was gently </p><p>holding my arm as he guided me away. </p><p>I was stuttering over and over again: </p><p>“B-but for God’s sake, what is it?” </p><p> Doctor McNeill told me the story in</p><p>his private office as I sprawled opposite </p><p>him in an easy-chair. The gold and </p><p>crimson of late afternoon changed to </p><p>the violet of early dusk, but still I sat </p><p>awed and motionless. I resented every </p><p>ring of the telephone and every wrhir </p><p>of the buzzer, and I could have cursed </p><p>the nurses and internes W’hose knocks </p><p>now and then summoned the doctor </p><p>briefly to the outer office. Night came, </p><p>and I was glad my host switched on all </p><p>the lights. Scientist though I was, my </p><p>zeal for research was half forgotten </p><p>amid such breathless ecstasies of fright </p><p>as a small boy might feel when whis- </p><p>pered witch-tales go the rounds of the </p><p>chimney-corner.</p><p> It seems that Yig, the snake-god of</p><p>the central plains tribes—presumably </p><p>the primal source of the more southerly </p><p>Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan — was an </p><p>odd, half-anthropomorphic devil of </p><p>highly arbitrary and capricious nature. </p><p>He was not wholly evil, and was usu- </p><p>ally quite well disposed toward those </p><p>who gave proper respect to him and </p><p>his children, the serpents; but in the </p><p>autumn he became abnormally ravenous </p><p>and had to be driven away by means </p><p>of suitable rites. That was why the </p><p>tom-toms in the Pawnee, Wichita, and </p><p>Caddo country pounded ceaselessly </p><p>week in and week out in August, Sep- </p><p>tember, and October; and why the </p><p>medicine-men made strange noises with </p><p>rattles and whistles curiously like those </p><p>of the Aztecs and Mayas. </p><p> Yig’s chief trait wras a relentless de-</p><p>votion to his children—a devotion so </p><p>great that the redskins almost feared to </p><p>protect themselves from the venomous </p><p>rattlesnakes which thronged the region. </p><p>Frightful clandestine tales hinted of his </p><p>vengeance upon mortals who flouted </p><p>him or wreaked harm upon his wrig- </p><p>gling progeny; his chosen method being </p><p>to turn his victim, after suitable tor- </p><p>tures, to a spotted snake. </p><p>Tn the old days of the Indian Ter- </p><p>ritory, the doctor went on, there </p><p>was not quite so much secrecy about </p><p>Yig. The plains tribes, less cautious </p><p>than the desert nomads and Pueblos, </p><p>talked quite freely of their legends and </p><p>autumn ceremonies with the first In- </p><p>dian agents, and let considerable of </p><p>the lore spread out through the neigh- </p><p>boring regions of white settlement. The </p><p>great fear came in the land-rush days </p><p>THE CURSE OF YIG </p><p>145 </p><p>of ’eighty-nine, when some extraordi- </p><p>nary incidents had been rumored, and </p><p>the rumors sustained, by what seemed </p><p>to be hideously tangible proofs. Indians </p><p>said that the new white men did not </p><p>know how to get on with Yig, and </p><p>afterward the settlers came to take that </p><p>theory at face value. Now no old- </p><p>timer in middle Oklahoma, white or </p><p>red, could be induced to breathe a word </p><p>about the snake-god except in vague </p><p>hints. Yet after all, the doctor added </p><p>with almost needless emphasis, the </p><p>only truly authenticated horror had </p><p>been a thing of pitiful tragedy rather </p><p>than of bewitchment. It was all very </p><p>material and cruel—even that last </p><p>phase which had caused so much dis- </p><p>pute. </p><p> Doctor McNeill paused and cleared</p><p>his throat before getting down to his </p><p>special story, and I felt a tingling sen- </p><p>sation as when a theatre curtain rises. </p><p>The thing had begun when Walker </p><p>Davis and his wife Audrey left Arkan- </p><p>sas to settle in the newly opened public </p><p>lands in the spring of 1889, and the </p><p>end had come in the country of the </p><p>Wichitas — north of the Wichita </p><p>River, in what is at present Caddo </p><p>County. There is a small village called </p><p>Binger there now, and the railway goes </p><p>through; but otherwise the place is less </p><p>changed than other parts of Oklahoma. </p><p>It is still a section of farms and ranches </p><p>—quite productive in these days—since </p><p>the great oil-fields do not come very </p><p>close. </p><p> Walker and Audrey ha’d come from</p><p>Franklin County in the Ozarks with a </p><p>canvas-topped wagon, two mules, an </p><p>ancient and useless dog called Wolf, </p><p>and all their household goods. They </p><p>were typical hill-folk, youngish and </p><p>perhaps a little more ambitious than </p><p>most, and looked forward to a life of </p><p>better returns for their hard work than </p><p>they had had in Arkansas. Both were </p><p>lean, rawr-boned specimens; the man </p><p>tall, sandy, and gray-eyed, and the </p><p>woman short and rather dark, with a </p><p>black straightness of hair suggesting a</p><p>slight Indian admixture. </p><p> In general, there was very little of</p><p>distinction about them, and but for one </p><p>thing their annals might not have dif- </p><p>fered from those of thousands of </p><p>other pioneers who flocked into the </p><p>new country at that time. That thing </p><p>was Walker's almost epileptic fear of </p><p>snakes, wrhich some laid to prenatal </p><p>causes, and some said came from a </p><p>dark prophecy about his end with </p><p>which an old Indian squaw had tried </p><p>to scare him when he was small. What- </p><p>ever the cause, the effect was marked </p><p>indeed; for despite his strong general </p><p>courage the very mention of a snake </p><p>would cause him to grow faint and </p><p>pale, while the sight of even a tiny </p><p>specimen wrould produce a shock some- </p><p>times bordering on a convulsion seizure. </p><p> The Davises started out early in the</p><p>year, in the hope of being on their new </p><p>land for the spring plowing. Travel </p><p>was slow; for the roads were bad in </p><p>Arkansas, while in the Territory there </p><p>were great stretches of rolling hills and </p><p>red, sandy barrens without any roads </p><p>whatever. As the terrain grew flatter, </p><p>the change from their native mountains </p><p>depressed them more, perhaps, than </p><p>they realized, but they found the people </p><p>at the Indian agencies very affable, </p><p>while most of the settled Indians seemed </p><p>friendly and civil. Now and then they </p><p>encountered a fellow-pioneer, with </p><p>whom crude pleasantries and expres- </p><p>sions of amiable rivalry were generally </p><p>exchanged. </p><p> Owing to the season, there were not</p><p>many snakes in evidence, so Walker </p><p>did not suffer from his special tempera- </p><p>mental weakness. In the earlier stages </p><p>144 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>of the journey, too, there were no In- </p><p>dian snake legends to trouble him; for </p><p>the transplanted tribes from the south- </p><p>east do not share the wilder beliefs of </p><p>their western neighbors. As fate would </p><p>have it, it was a white man at Okmul- </p><p>gee in the Creek country who gave the </p><p>Davises the first hint of the Yig beliefs; </p><p>a hint which had a curiously fascinating </p><p>'effect on Walker, and caused him to </p><p>ask questions very freely after that. </p><p> Before long Walker’s fascination</p><p>had developed into a bad case of </p><p>fright. He took the most extraordinary </p><p>precautions at each of the nightly </p><p>camps, always clearing away whatever </p><p>vegetation he found, and avoiding </p><p>stony places whenever he could. Every </p><p>clump of stunted bushes and every cleft </p><p>in the great, slab-like rocks seemed to </p><p>him now to hide malevolent serpents, </p><p>while every human figure not obviously </p><p>part of a settlement or emigrant train </p><p>seemed to him a potential snake-god </p><p>till nearness had proved the contrary. </p><p>Fortunately no troublesome encounters </p><p>came at this stage to shake his nerves </p><p>still further. </p><p> As they approached the Kickapoo</p><p>country they found it harder and </p><p>harder to avoid camping near rocks. </p><p>Finally it was no longer possible, and </p><p>poor Walker was reduced to the puerile </p><p>expedient of droning some of the rus- </p><p>tic anti-snake charms he had learned in </p><p>his boyhood. Two or three times a </p><p>snake was really glimpsed, and these </p><p>sights did not help the sufferer in his </p><p>efforts to preserve composure. </p><p> On the twenty-second evening of die</p><p>journey a savage wind made it impera- </p><p>tive, for the sake of the mules, to camp </p><p>in as sheltered a spot as possible; and </p><p>Audrey persuaded her husband to take </p><p>advantage of a cliff which rose uncom- </p><p>monly high above the dried bed of a </p><p>former tributary of the Canadian </p><p>River. He did not like the rocky cast </p><p>of the place, but allowed himself to be </p><p>overruled this once; leading the ani- </p><p>mals sullenly toward the protecting</p><p>slope, which the nature of the ground </p><p>would not allow the wagon to ap- </p><p>proach. </p><p> Audrey, examining the rocks near</p><p>the wagon, meanwhile noticed a singu- </p><p>lar sniffing on the part of the feeble old </p><p>dog. Seizing a rifle, she followed his </p><p>lead, and presently thanked her stars </p><p>that she had forestalled Walker in her </p><p>discovery. For there, snugly nested in </p><p>the gap between two boulders, was a </p><p>sight it would have done him no good </p><p>to see. Visible only as one convoluted </p><p>expanse, but perhaps comprising as </p><p>many as three or four separate units, </p><p>was a mass of lazy wriggling which </p><p>could not be other than a brood of new- </p><p>born rattlesnakes. </p><p> Anxious to save Walker from a try-</p><p>ing shock, Audrey did not hesitate to </p><p>act, but took the gun firmly by the bar- </p><p>rel and brought the butt down again </p><p>and again upon the writhing objects. </p><p>Her own sense of loathing was great, </p><p>but it did not amount to a real fear. </p><p>Finally she saw that her task was done, </p><p>and turned to cleanse the improvised </p><p>bludgeon in the red sand and dry, dead </p><p>grass near by. She must, she reflected, </p><p>cover the nest up before Walker got </p><p>back from tethering the mules. Old </p><p>Wolf, tottering relic of mixed shep- </p><p>herd and coyote ancestry that he was, </p><p>had vanished, and she feared he had </p><p>gone to fetch his master. </p><p>"C^ootsteps at that instant proved </p><p> her fear well founded, A second</p><p>more, and Walker had seen everything. </p><p>Audrey made a move to catch him if he </p><p>should faint, but he. did no more than </p><p>sway. Then the look of pure fright on </p><p>his bloodless face turned slowly to </p><p>THE CURSE OF YIG </p><p>14? </p><p>something like mingled awe and anger, </p><p>and he began to upbraid his wife in </p><p>trembling tones. </p><p> “Gawd's sake, Aud, but why’d ye go</p><p>for to do that? Hain’t ye heerd all the </p><p>things they’ve ben tellin’ about this </p><p>snake-devil Yig? Ye’d ought to a told </p><p>me, and we’d a moved on. Don’t ye </p><p>know they’s a devil-god what gets even </p><p>if ye hurts his children? What for </p><p>d’ye think the Injuns all dances and </p><p>beats their drums in the fall about? </p><p>This land’s under a curse, I can tell ye </p><p>—nigh every soul we’ve a-talked to </p><p>sence we come in’s said the same. Yig </p><p>rules here, an’ he comes out every fall </p><p>for to git his victims and turn ’em into </p><p>snakes. Why, Aud, they won’t none of </p><p>them Injuns acrost the Canayjin kill a </p><p>snake for love nor money! </p><p> “Gawd knows what ye done to your-</p><p>self, gal, a-stompin’ out a hull brood o’ </p><p>\ ig’s chillen. He’ll git ye, sure, sooner </p><p>or later, unlessen I kin buy a charm </p><p>offen some o’ the Injun medicine-men. </p><p>He’ll git ye, Aud, as sure’s they’s a </p><p>Gawd in heaven—he’ll come oua the </p><p>night and turn ye into a crawlin’ spotted </p><p>snake!” </p><p> All the rest of the journey Walker</p><p>kept up the frightened reproofs and </p><p>prophecies. They crossed the Canadian </p><p>near Newcastle, and soon afterward </p><p>met with the first of the real plains </p><p>Indians they had seen—a party of </p><p>blanketed Wichitas, whose leader talked </p><p>freely under the spell of the whisky </p><p>offered him, -and taught poor Walker </p><p>a long-winded protective charm against </p><p>Yig in exchange for a quart bottle of </p><p>the same inspiring fluid. By the end of </p><p>the week the chosen site in the Wichita </p><p>country was reached, and the Davises </p><p>made haste to trace their boundaries </p><p>and perform the spring plowing before </p><p>even beginning the construction of a </p><p>cabin. </p><p> The region was fiat, drearily windy,</p><p>and sparse of natural vegetation, but </p><p>promised great fertility under cultiva- </p><p>tion. Occasional outcroppings of gran-</p><p>ite diversified a soil of decomposed red </p><p>sandstone, and here and there a great </p><p>fiat rock would stretch along the sur- </p><p>face of the ground like a man-made </p><p>floor. There seemed to be very few </p><p>snakes, or possible dens for them; so </p><p>Audrey at last persuaded Walker to </p><p>build the one-room cabin over a vast, </p><p>smooth slab of exposed stone. With </p><p>such a flooring and with a good-sized </p><p>fireplace the wettest weather might be </p><p>defied—though it soon became evident </p><p>that dampness was no salient quality of </p><p>the district. Logs were hauled in the </p><p>wagon from the nearest belt of woods, </p><p>many miles toward the Wichita Moun- </p><p>tains. </p><p> Walker built his wide-chimneyed</p><p>cabin and crude barn with the aid of </p><p>the other settlers, though the nearest </p><p>one was over a mile away. In turn, he </p><p>helped his helpers at similar house- </p><p>raisings, so that many ties of friend- </p><p>ship sprang up between the new neigh- </p><p>bors. There was no town worthy the </p><p>name nearer than El Reno, on the rail- </p><p>way thirty miles or more to the north- </p><p>east; and before many weeks had </p><p>passed, the people of the section had </p><p>become very cohesive despite the wide- </p><p>ness of their scattering. The Indians, </p><p>a few of whom had begun to settle </p><p>down on ranches, were for the most </p><p>part harmless, though somewhat quar- </p><p>relsome when fired by the liquid stimu- </p><p>lation which found its way to them de- </p><p>spite all Government bans. </p><p> Of all the neighbors the Davises</p><p>found Joe and Sally Compton, who </p><p>likewise hailed from Arkansas, the </p><p>most helpful and congenial. Sally is still </p><p>alive, known now as Grandma Comp- </p><p>ton^ and her son Clyde, then an infant </p><p>146 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>in arms, has become one of the leading </p><p>men of the State. Sally and Audrey </p><p>used to visit each other often, for their </p><p>cabins were only two miles apart; and </p><p>in the long spring and summer after- </p><p>noons they exchanged many a tale of </p><p>old Arkansas and many a rumor about </p><p>the new country. </p><p> Sally was very sympathetic about</p><p>Walker’s weakness regarding snakes, </p><p>but perhaps did more to aggravate </p><p>than cure the parallel nervousness </p><p>which Audrey was acquiring through </p><p>his incessant praying and prophesying </p><p>about the curse of Yig. She was un- </p><p>commonly full of gruesome snake </p><p>stories, and produced a direfully strong </p><p>impression with her acknowledged mas- </p><p>terpiece—the tale of a man in Scott </p><p>County who had been bitten by a whole </p><p>horde of rattlers at once, and had </p><p>swelled so monstrously from poison </p><p>that his body had finally burst with a </p><p>pop. Needless to say, Audrey did not </p><p>repeat this anecdote to her husband, </p><p>and she implored the Comptons to be- </p><p>ware of starting it on the rounds of the </p><p>countryside. It is to Joe’s and Sally’s </p><p>credit that they heeded this plea with </p><p>the utmost fidelity. </p><p> Walker did his corn-planting early,</p><p>and in midsummer improved his time </p><p>by harvesting a fair crop of the native </p><p>grass of the region. With the help of </p><p>Joe Compton he dug a well which gave </p><p>a moderate supply of very good water, </p><p>though he planned to sink an artesian </p><p>later on. He did not run into many </p><p>serious snake scares, and made his land </p><p>as inhospitable as possible for wrig- </p><p>gling visitors. Every now and then he </p><p>rode over to the cluster of thatched, </p><p>conical huts which formed the main vil- </p><p>lage of the Wichitas, and talked long </p><p>with the old men and shamans about </p><p>the snake-god and how to nullify his </p><p>wrath. Charms were always ready in </p><p>exchange for whisky, but much of the </p><p>information he got was far from reas- </p><p>suring. </p><p> Yig was a great god. He was bad</p><p>medicine. He did not forget things. In </p><p>the autumn his children were hungry </p><p>and wild, and Yig was hungry and </p><p>wild, too. All the tribes made medicine </p><p>against Yig when the corn harvest </p><p>came. They gave him some corn, and </p><p>danced in proper regalia to the sound </p><p>of whistle, rattle, and drum. They kept </p><p>the drums pounding to drive Yig away, </p><p>and called down the aid of Tirawa, </p><p>whose children men are, even as the </p><p>snakes are Yig’s children. It was bad </p><p>that the squaw of Davis killed the chil- </p><p>dren of Yig. Let Davis say the charms </p><p>many times when the corn harvest </p><p>comes. Yig is Yig. Yig is a great god. </p><p> By the time the corn harvest did</p><p>come, Walker had succeeded in getting </p><p>his wife into a deplorably jumpy state. </p><p>His prayers and borrowed incantations </p><p>came to be a nuisance; and when the </p><p>autumn rites of the Indians began, there </p><p>was always a distant wind-borne pound- </p><p>ing of tom-toms to lend an added back- </p><p>ground of the sinister. It was madden- </p><p>ing to have the muffled clatter always </p><p>stealing over the wide, red plains. Why </p><p>would it never stop? Day and night, </p><p>week on week, it was always going in </p><p>exhaustless relays, as persistently as the </p><p>red dusty winds that carried it. Audrey </p><p>loathed it more than her husband did, </p><p>for he saw in it a compensating ele- </p><p>ment of protection. It was with this </p><p>sense of a mighty, intangible bulwark </p><p>against evil that he got in his corn crop </p><p>and prepared cabin and stable for the </p><p>coming winter. </p><p> The autumn was abnormally warm,</p><p>and except for their primitive cookery </p><p>the Davises found scant use for the </p><p>stone fireplace Walker had built with </p><p>such care. Something in the unnatural- </p><p>THE CURSE OF YIG </p><p>147 </p><p>ness of the hot dust-clouds preyed on </p><p>the nerves of all the settlers, but most </p><p>of all on Audrey’s and Walker’s. The </p><p>notions of a hovering snake-curse and </p><p>the weird, endless rhythm of the dis- </p><p>tant Indian drums formed a bad com- </p><p>bination which any added element of </p><p>the bizarre went far to render utterly </p><p>unendurable. </p><p> Notwithstanding this strain, several</p><p>festive gatherings were held at one or </p><p>another of the cabins after the crops </p><p>were reaped: keeping naively alive in </p><p>modernity those curious rites of the </p><p>harvest-home which are as old as hu- </p><p>man agriculture itself. Lafayette Smith, </p><p>who came from southern Missouri and </p><p>had a cabin about three miles east of </p><p>Walker’s, was a very passable fiddler; </p><p>and his tunes did much to make the </p><p>celebrants forget the monotonous beat- </p><p>ing of the distant tom-toms. Then Hal- </p><p>lowe’en drew near, and the settlers </p><p>planned another frolic—this time, had </p><p>they but known it, of a lineage older </p><p>than even agriculture: the dread Witch- </p><p>Sabbath of the primal pre-Aryans, kept </p><p>alive through ages in the midnight </p><p>blackness of secret woods, and still </p><p>hinting at vague terrors under its latter- </p><p>day mask of comedy and lightness. </p><p>Hallowe’en was to fall on a Thursday, </p><p>and the neighbors agreed to gather for </p><p>their first revel at the Davis cabin. </p><p>Tt was on that thirty-first of Oeto- </p><p>ber that the warm spell broke. The </p><p>morning was gray and leaden, and by </p><p>noon the incessant winds had changed </p><p>from searingness to rawness. People </p><p>shivered all the more because they were </p><p>not prepared for the chill, and Walker </p><p>Davis’s old dog, Wolf, dragged him- </p><p>self wearily indoors to a place beside </p><p>the hearth. But the distant drums still </p><p>thumped on, nor were the white citi- </p><p>zenry less inclined to pursue their </p><p>chosen rites. As early as four in the </p><p>afternoon the wagons began to arrive </p><p>at Walker’s cabin; and in the evening, </p><p>after a memorable barbecue, Lafayette </p><p>Smith’s fiddle inspired a very fair-sized </p><p>company to great feats of saltatory</p><p>grotesqueness in the one good-sized but </p><p>crowded room. The younger folk in- </p><p>dulged in the amiable inanities proper </p><p>to the season, and now and then old </p><p>Wolf would howl with doleful and </p><p>spine-tickling ominousness at some </p><p>especially spectral strain from Lafay- </p><p>ette’s squeaky violin—a device he had </p><p>never heard before. Mostly, though, </p><p>this battered veteran slept through the </p><p>merriment, for he was past the age of </p><p>active interests and lived largely in his </p><p>dreams. Tom and Jennie Rigby had </p><p>brought their collie Zeke along, but the </p><p>canines did not fraternize. Zeke seemed </p><p>strangely uneasy over something, and </p><p>nosed around curiously all the evening. </p><p> Audrey and Walker made a fine</p><p>couple on the floor, and Grandma </p><p>Compton still likes to recall her impres- </p><p>sion of their dancing that night. Their </p><p>worries seemed forgotten for the </p><p>nonce, and Walker was shaved and </p><p>trimmed into a surprising degree of </p><p>spruceness. By ten o’clock all hands </p><p>were healthily tired, and the guests be- </p><p>gan to depart family by family with </p><p>many handshakings and bluff assur- </p><p>ances of what a fine time everybody </p><p>had had. Tom and Jennie thought </p><p>Zeke’s eery howls as he followed them </p><p>to their wagon were marks of regret at </p><p>having to go home; though Audrey </p><p>said it must be the far-away tom-toms </p><p>which annoyed him, for the distant </p><p>thumping was surely ghastly enough </p><p>after the merriment within. </p><p> The night was bitterly cold, and for</p><p>the first time Walker put a great log in </p><p>the fireplace and banked it with ashes </p><p>to keep it smoldering till morning. Old </p><p>143 </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>Wolf dragged himself within the ruddy </p><p>glow and lapsed into his customary </p><p>coma. Audrey and Walker, too tired to </p><p>think of charms or curses, tumbled into </p><p>the rough pine bed and were asleep be- </p><p>fore the cheap alarm-clock on the man- </p><p>tel had ticked out three minutes. And </p><p>from far away, the rhythmic pounding </p><p>of those hellish tom-toms still pulsed on </p><p>the chill night wind. </p><p> Doctor McNeill paused here and re-</p><p>moved his glasses, as if a blurring of </p><p>the objective world might make the </p><p>reminiscent vision clearer. </p><p> “You’ll soon appreciate,” he said,</p><p>“that I had a great deal of difficulty in </p><p>piecing out all that happened after the </p><p>guests left. There were times, though </p><p>—at first—when I was able to make a </p><p>try at it.” After a moment of silence he </p><p>went on writh the tale. </p><p> Audrey had terrible dreams of Yig,</p><p>who appeared to her in the guise of </p><p>Satan as depicted in cheap engravings </p><p>she had seen. It was, indeed, from an </p><p>absolute ecstasy of nightmare that she </p><p>started suddenly awake to find Walker </p><p>already conscious and sitting up in bed. </p><p>He seemed to be listening intently to </p><p>something, and silenced her with a </p><p>whisper when she began to ask what </p><p>had aroused him. </p><p> “Hark, Aud !” he breathed. “Don’t</p><p>ye hear somethin’ a-singin* and buzzin’ </p><p>and rustlin’? D’ye reckon it’s the fall </p><p>crickets?” </p><p> Certainly, there v^vas distinctly audi-</p><p>ble within the cabin such a sound as he </p><p>had described. Audrey tried to analyze </p><p>it, and was impressed with some ele- </p><p>ment at once horrible and familiar, </p><p>which hovered just outside the rim of </p><p>her memory. And beyond it all, waking </p><p>a hideous thought, the monotonous </p><p>beating of the distant tom-toms came </p><p>incessantly across the black plains on </p><p>which a cloudy half-moon had set. </p><p> “Walker—s’pose it’s—the—the—</p><p>curse o’ Yig?”</p><p> She could feel him tremble.</p><p> “No, gal, I don’t reckon he comes</p><p>that way. He’s shapen like a man, ex- </p><p>cept ye look at him clost. That’s what </p><p>Chief Gray Eagle says. This here’s </p><p>some varmints come in outen the cold </p><p>—not crickets, I calc’late, but summat </p><p>like ’em. 1 orter git up and stomp </p><p>’em out afore they make much headway </p><p>or git at the cupboard.” </p><p> He rose, felt for the lantern that</p><p>hung within easy reach, and rattled the </p><p>tin match-box nailed to the wall beside </p><p>it. Audrey sat up in bed and watched </p><p>the. flare of the match grow into the </p><p>steady glow of the lantern. Then, as </p><p>their eyes began to take in the whole of </p><p>the room, the crude rafters shook with </p><p>the frenzy of their simultaneous shriek. </p><p>For the flat, rocky floor, revealed in the </p><p>new-born illumination, was one seeth- </p><p>ing, brown-speckled mass of wriggling </p><p>rattlesnakes, slithering toward the fire, </p><p>and even now turning their loathsome </p><p>heads to menace the fright-blasted lan- </p><p>tern-bearer. </p><p> It was only for an instant that Aud-</p><p>rey saw the things. The reptiles were </p><p>of every size, of uncountable numbers, </p><p>and apparently of several varieties; </p><p>and even as she looked, two or three </p><p>of them reared their heads as if to </p><p>strike at Walker. She did not faint— </p><p>it was Walker’s crash to the floor that </p><p>extinguished the lantern and plunged </p><p>her into blackness. He had not </p><p>screamed a second time—fright had </p><p>paralyzed him, and he fell as if shot </p><p>by a silent arrow from no mortal’s bow. </p><p>To Audrey the entire world seemed to </p><p>whirl about fantastically, mingling with </p><p>the nightmare from which she had </p><p>started. </p><p> Voluntary motion of any sort was</p><p>impossible, for will and the sense of </p><p>THE CURSE OF YIG </p><p>149 </p><p>reality had left her. She fell back </p><p>inertly on her pillow, hoping that she </p><p>would wake soon. No actual sense of </p><p>what had happened penetrated her </p><p>mind for some time. Then, little by </p><p>little, the suspicion that she was really </p><p>awake began to dawn on her; and she </p><p>was convulsed with a mounting blend </p><p>of panic and grief which made her long </p><p>to shriek out despite the inhibiting spell </p><p>which kept her mute. </p><p> Walker was gone, and she had not</p><p>been able to help him. He had died of </p><p>snakes, just as the old witeh-woman had </p><p>predicted when he was a little boy. Poor </p><p>Wolf had not been able to help, either </p><p>—probably he had not even awakened </p><p>from his senile stupor. And now the </p><p>crawling things must be coming for her, </p><p>writhing closer and closer every mo- </p><p>ment in the dark, perhaps even now </p><p>twining slipperily about the bedposts </p><p>and oozing up over the coarse woollen </p><p>blankets. Unconsciously she crept un- </p><p>der the clothes and trembled. </p><p> It must be the curse of Yig. He had</p><p>sent his monstrous children on All-Hal- </p><p>lows’ Night, and they had taken </p><p>Walker first. Why was that—wasn’t </p><p>he innocent enough? Why not come </p><p>straight for her—hadn’t she killed </p><p>those little ratders alone? Then she </p><p>thought of the curse’s form as told by </p><p>the Indians. She wouldn’t be killed— </p><p>just turned to a spotted snake. Ugh! </p><p>So she would be like those things she </p><p>had glimpsed on the floor—those things </p><p>which Yig had sent to get her and en- </p><p>roll her among.their number! She tried </p><p>to mumble a charm that Walker had </p><p>taught: her, but found she could not </p><p>utter a single sound, </p><p>HHhe NOISY ticking of the alarm-clock </p><p> sounded above the maddening beat</p><p>of the distant tom-toms. The snakes </p><p>were taking a long time—did they </p><p>mean to delay on purpose to play on </p><p>her nerves? Every now and then she </p><p>thought she felt a steady, insidious pres- </p><p>sure on the bedclothes, but each time</p><p>it turned out to be only the automatic </p><p>twitchings of her over-wrought nerves. </p><p>The clock ticked on in the dark, and a </p><p>change came slowly over her thoughts. </p><p> Those snakes couldn’t have taken so</p><p>long! They couldn’t be Yig’s messen- </p><p>gers after all, but just natural rattlers </p><p>that were nested belowr the rock and </p><p>had been drawn there by the fire. They </p><p>weren’t coming for her, perhaps—per- </p><p>haps they had sated themselves on poor </p><p>Walker. Where were they now ? Gone ? </p><p>Coiled by the fire? Still crawling over </p><p>the prone corpse of their victim? The </p><p>clock ticked, and the distant drums </p><p>throbbed on. </p><p> At the thought of her husband’s body</p><p>lying there in the pitch blackness a thrill </p><p>of purely physical horror passed over </p><p>Audrey. That story of Sally Comp- </p><p>ton’s about the. man back in Scott </p><p>County! He, too, had been bitten by a </p><p>whole bunch of rattlesnakes, and what </p><p>had happened to him ? The poison had </p><p>rotted the flesh and swelled the whole </p><p>corpse, and in the end the bloated thing </p><p>had burst horribly—burst horribly with </p><p>a detestable popping noise. Was that </p><p>what was happening to Walker down </p><p>there on the rock floor? Instinctively </p><p>she felt that she had begun to listen for </p><p>something too terrible even to name to </p><p>herself. </p><p> The clock ticked on, keeping a kind</p><p>of mocking, sardonic time with the far- </p><p>off drumming that the night wind </p><p>brought. She wished it were a striking </p><p>clock, so that she could know how long </p><p>this eldritch vigil must last. She cursed </p><p>the toughness of fiber that kept her </p><p>from fainting, and wondered what sort </p><p>of relief the dawn, could bring, after all. </p><p>Probably neighbors would pass—no </p><p>17tf </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>doubt somebody would call—would </p><p>they find her still sane? Was she still </p><p>sane now? </p><p> Morbidly listening, Audrey all at</p><p>once became aware of something which </p><p>she had to verify with every effort of </p><p>her will before she could believe it; and </p><p>which, once verified, she did not know </p><p>whether to welcome or dread. The dis- </p><p>tant heating of the Indian tom-toms </p><p>had ceased. </p><p> She did not relish this new and sud-</p><p>den silence, after all! There was some- </p><p>thing sinister about it. The loud-ticking </p><p>clock seemed abnormal in its new lone- </p><p>liness. Capable at last of conscious mo- </p><p>tion, she shook the covers from her </p><p>face and looked into the darkness to- </p><p>ward the window. It must have cleared </p><p>after the moon set, for she saw the </p><p>square aperture distincdy against the </p><p>background of stars. </p><p> Then without warning came that</p><p>shocking, unutterable sound—ugh !— </p><p>that dull pop of cleft skin and escaping </p><p>poison in the dark. God !— The bonds </p><p>of muteness snapped, and the black </p><p>night waxed reverberant with Audrey’s </p><p>screams of stark, unbridled frenzy. </p><p> Consciousness did not pass away with</p><p>the shock. Flow merciful if only it had! </p><p>Amidst the echoes of her shrieking </p><p>Audrey still saw the star-sprinkled </p><p>square of window ahead, and heard the </p><p>doom-boding ticking of that frightful </p><p>clock. Did she hear another sound? </p><p>Was that square window still a perfect </p><p>square? She was in no condition to </p><p>weigh the evidence of her senses or dis- </p><p>tinguish between fact and hallucination. </p><p> No—that window was not a perfect</p><p>square. Something had encroached on </p><p>the lower edge. Nor was the ticking of </p><p>the clock the only sound in the room. </p><p>There was, beyond dispute, a heavy </p><p>breathing neither her own nor poor </p><p>Wolfs. Wolf slept very silently, and </p><p>his wakeful wheezing was unmistak- </p><p>able. Then Audrey saw against the</p><p>stars the black, demoniac silhouette of </p><p>something anthropoid—the undulant </p><p>bulk of a gigantic head and shoulders </p><p>fumbling slowly toward her. </p><p> “Y’aaaah! Y’aaaah! Go away! Go</p><p>away! Go away, snake devil! Go 'way, </p><p>Yig! I didn't mean to kill ’em—I was </p><p>feared he'd be scairt of ’em. Don’t, </p><p>Yig, don’t! I didn’t go for to hurt yore </p><p>chillen—don't come nigh me—don’t </p><p>change me into no spotted snake !” </p><p> But the half-formless head and</p><p>shoulders only lurched onward toward </p><p>the bed, very silently. </p><p> Everything snapped at once inside</p><p>Audrey’s head, and in a second she had </p><p>turned from a cowering child to a rag- </p><p>ing madwoman. She knew where the </p><p>ax was—hung against the wall on those </p><p>pegs near the lantern. It was within </p><p>easy reach, and she could find it in the </p><p>dark. Before she was conscious of any- </p><p>thing further it was in her hands, and </p><p>she was creeping toward the foot of </p><p>the bed—toward the monstrous head </p><p>and shoulders that every moment </p><p>groped their way nearer. Had there </p><p>been any light, the look on her face </p><p>would not have been pleasant to see. </p><p> “Take that, you! And that, and</p><p>that, and that!” </p><p> She was laughing shrilly now, and</p><p>her cackles mounted higher as she saw </p><p>that the starlight beyond the window </p><p>was yielding to the dim prophetic </p><p>pallor of coming dawn. </p><p>T~\octor MCNEILL wiped the persi- </p><p>ration from his forehead and put </p><p>on his glasses again. I waited for him </p><p>to resume, and as he kept silent, I spoke </p><p>softly. </p><p> “She lived? She was found? Was it</p><p>ever explained?” </p><p> The doctor cleared his throat.</p><p>■ THE CURSE OF YIG </p><p>151 </p><p> “Yes—she lived, in a way. And it</p><p>was explained. I told you there was no </p><p>bewitchment—only cruel, pitiful, ma- </p><p>terial horror.” </p><p> It was Sally Compton who had made</p><p>the discovery. She had ridden over to </p><p>the Davis cabin the next afternoon to </p><p>talk over the party with Audrey, and </p><p>had seen no smoke from the chimney. </p><p>That was queer. It had turned very </p><p>warm again, yet Audrey was usually </p><p>cooking something at that hour. The </p><p>mules were making hungry-sounding </p><p>noises in the barn, and there was no </p><p>sign of old Wolf sunning himself in the </p><p>accustomed spot by the door. </p><p> Altogether, Sally did not like the</p><p>look of the place, so was very timid and </p><p>hesitant as she dismounted and knocked. </p><p>She got no answer, but waited some </p><p>time before trying the crude door of </p><p>split logs. The lock, it appeared, was </p><p>unfastened; and she slowly pushed her </p><p>way in. Then, perceiving what was </p><p>there, she reeled back, gasped, and </p><p>clung to the jamb to preserve her bal- </p><p>ance. </p><p> A terrible odor had welled out as she</p><p>opened the door, but that was not what </p><p>had stunned her. It was what she had </p><p>seen. For within that shadowy cabin </p><p>monstrous diings had happened and </p><p>three shocking objects remained on the </p><p>floor to awe and baffle the beholder. </p><p>ATEAR the burned-out fireplace was </p><p>the great dog—purple decay on </p><p>the skin left bare by mange and old </p><p>age, and the whole carcass burst by the </p><p>puffing effect of rattlesnake poison. It </p><p>must have been bitten by a veritable </p><p>legion of the reptiles. </p><p> To the right of die door was the ax-</p><p>hacked remnant of what had been a </p><p>man—clad in a nightshirt, and with the </p><p>shattered bulk of a lantern clenched in </p><p>one hand. He was totally free from </p><p>any sign of snake-bite. Near him lay </p><p>the ensanguined ax, carelessly dis- </p><p>carded.</p><p> And wriggling flat on the floor was</p><p>a loathsome, vacant-eyed thing that </p><p>had been a woman, but was now only a </p><p>mute mad caricature. All that this </p><p>thing could do was to hiss, and hiss, </p><p>and hiss. </p><p> Both the doctor and I were brushing</p><p>cold drops from our foreheads by this </p><p>time. He poured something from a </p><p>flask on his desk, took a nip, and handed </p><p>another glass to me. I could only sug- </p><p>gest tremulously and stupidly: </p><p> “So Walker had only fainted that</p><p>first time—the screams roused him, and </p><p>the ax did the rest?” </p><p> “Yes.” Doctor McNeill’s voice was</p><p>low. “But he met his death from </p><p>snakes just the same. It was his fear </p><p>working in two ways—it made him </p><p>faint, and it made him fill his wife with </p><p>the wild stories that caused her to </p><p>strike out when she thought she saw </p><p>the snake devil.” </p><p> I thought for a moment.</p><p> “And Audrey—wasn’t it queer how</p><p>the curse of Yig seemed to work itself </p><p>out on her? I suppose the impresion of </p><p>hissing snakes had been fairly ground </p><p>into her.” </p><p> “Yes. There were lucid spells at</p><p>first, but they got to be fewer and </p><p>fewer. Fler hair came white at the </p><p>roots as it grew, and later began to fall </p><p>out. The skin grew blotchy, and when </p><p>she died-” </p><p> I interrupted with a start.</p><p> “Died? Then what was that—that</p><p>thing downstairs?” </p><p> Doctor McNeill spoke gravely.</p><p> “That is what was born to her three-</p><p>quarters of a year afterwards. There </p><p>were three more of diem-—two were </p><p>even wTorse—but this is the only one </p><p>that lived.” </p><p>COMING NEXT MONTH </p><p>Robert E. Howard, at the time of his tragic death, was working on a </p><p>new novel for Weird Tales. He had completed a rough first draft, </p><p>k and nearly completed a revision which was to be his final version. </p><p>The bullet which crashed into his brain prevented the author from finishing </p><p>this, his last story. It is a thrilling tale of popping action, depicted as only </p><p>Howard could depict action, with a bone-crushing wildcat of a hero, in the </p><p>weirdest possible adventures. </p><p> So engrossing is this story, Almuric, that Weird Tales would not be</p><p>playing fair with you, the readers, if we did not let you see it. Therefore </p><p>we have pieced together the nearly completed final draft that Howard </p><p>wrote, with the final pages of Howard’s rough first draft, which contains </p><p>a smashing denouement. </p><p> Beginning in the United States in our day, the scene quickly shifts</p><p>to another planet, called by the author Almuric. From his arrival in </p><p>Almuric, the hero tells the story of his weird adventures in his own words. </p><p>And what adventures they are! The creator of those indomitable characters </p><p>that have delighted thousands of readers of this magazine—King Kull and </p><p>his Shadow Kingdom, Solomon Kane the dour Puritan righter of wrongs, </p><p>Conan the barbarian adventurer—‘has here created the doughtiest hero of </p><p>them all: Esau Cairn, also known as Esau Ironhand. </p><p> This fascinating story will begin publication in next month’s WEIRD</p><p>Tales. </p><p> ALMURIC</p><p> By Robert E. Howard</p><p> als</p><p>THE DARK ISLE </p><p> By Robert Bloch</p><p>THE THINKING MACHINE </p><p>By J. J. CONNINGTON </p><p>A tale of the Romans and the Druids, </p><p>and the horrendous doom revealed by the </p><p>flaring torchlight in a frightful under- </p><p>ground cavern in England. </p><p>A strange and curious story about a fan- </p><p>tastic machine that possessed a brute de- </p><p>sire to slay—a startling thrill-tale of an </p><p>eery invention. </p><p>THE HOLLOW MOON </p><p>By Everil Worrell </p><p>WASHINGTON NOCTURNE </p><p>By Seabury Quinn </p><p>A fascinatingly different story about a </p><p>weird adventure that befell a yachting </p><p>party shipwrecked in the South Seas— </p><p>the strangest of all vampire tales. </p><p>Who was the stranger that walked before </p><p>the Tomb and vanished, yet by his mere </p><p>coming radically changed the lives of three </p><p>persons?—a tale of the Unknown Soldier. </p><p>May Issue of Weird Tales </p><p>THE increased number of pages has </p><p>been enthusiastically received by </p><p>you, the readers, judging by the let- </p><p>ters that you have sent to the Eyrie. The only </p><p>doubt in any of your letters has been a slight </p><p>fear that we will not be able to keep up the </p><p>quality that you have come to expect in </p><p>Weird Tales. We can only pledge again </p><p>that there will be no falling off in the quality </p><p>of our stories. Of this you may be sure. </p><p> A jumbo Edition</p><p>Sam Moskowitz writes from Newark, New </p><p>Jersey: "Need I mention the great gratifica- </p><p>tion with which I read the jumbo (compara- </p><p>tively speaking) issue of Weird Tales which </p><p>hit the newsstand but a few days past? The </p><p>increased content, it gives me pleasure to state, </p><p>has not in the least affected the fine quality </p><p>of your material. All the little nicknacks </p><p>which give the magazine atmosphere are back </p><p>again, along with the masterful Finlay and </p><p>the incomparable Lovecraft, Howard and </p><p>Smith- May you find the success your maga- </p><p>zine justly deserves.” </p><p> 32 Pages Thicker</p><p>Harry Warner, Jr., writes from Hagers- </p><p>town, Maryland: "What a shock to see </p><p>Weird Tales 32 pages thicker! Of course, </p><p>I had known it was coming, for I had seen </p><p>the announcements, and was expecting it. </p><p>But even at that, it still seems too good to be </p><p>true. Now if you can only continue to fill </p><p>160 pages with the kind of literature you are </p><p>accustomed to printing everything will be all </p><p>right. / Found Cleopatra ended wonderfully, </p><p>one of the best Egyptian tales I’ve ever read, </p><p>and with a truly logical ending. The only </p><p>fault I can find is that there was a little too </p><p>much 'cowboy and Indian* stuff in parts of </p><p>it; outside of that it was perfect, dark Ash- </p><p>ton Smith’s ability as an author is confirmed </p><p>even more by The Double Shadow, apd in </p><p>The Transgressor by Henry Kuttner you have </p><p>one of the few really good time-travel tales </p><p>ever written. This is a pet subject of mine, </p><p>but most of the yarns along this line are </p><p>positively silly. But in a thousand words or </p><p>so Kuttner writes one of the best of them ail </p><p>—perhaps only second to the grand-daddy of </p><p>them all, Wells' The Time Machine. The </p><p>Drifting Snow came a lirtle soon after The </p><p>Snow-Man, but despite this was truly read- </p><p>able. The Last Horror didn’t click with me, </p><p>for some reason; marvelous as a psychologi- </p><p>cal study, but not so fitting for Weird. I’ve </p><p>not read the rest of the issue yet—no times</p><p>except for Death Is an Elephant which was </p><p>okay. Unusual subject, and well done.” </p><p> A Promise Fulfilled</p><p>Paul N.

You have, since the new </p><p>ownership, given us something new and thrill- </p><p>ing, besides the stories each month. The re- </p><p>turn of JPD [Doolin] who can really draw </p><p>well when he tries. (The best illustration for </p><p>the Novemb^i issue was The Nameless City.) </p><p>Then Virgil Finlay came home in the Decem- </p><p>ber number with More Lives Than One (best </p><p>drawing in issue), that most delightful tale </p><p>by Seabury Quinn. January—the cover by </p><p>Findlay and better illustrations (The Fifth </p><p>Candle took the prize). February, the most </p><p>amazing issue of all—160 pages—an astound- </p><p>ing feat of good sense, and long sought after </p><p>by us all. Who could ask for more? But </p><p>you give us more. First, you bring back H. S. </p><p>DeLay after a long absence. His filmy, mys-</p><p>terious works of art are just the thing for the </p><p>weird type of magazine. You present a serial </p><p>by Manly Wade Wellman which has caught </p><p>my interest more firmly than any other serial </p><p>ever has. You print stories by Clark Ashton </p><p>Smith and Donald Wandrei, both away from </p><p>the fold too long a time. You give us two </p><p>sonnets by H. P. Lovecraft. I could go on </p><p>and on with all the marvels you have accom- </p><p>plished. Speaking of the latter two authors, </p><p>couldn’t some of your poets present a series </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>155 </p><p> of sonnets similar to those presented about</p><p> ten years ago, namely, Fungi from Yuggoth</p><p> by H. P. L. and Sonnets of the Midnight</p><p> Hours by Wandrei? These were a great suc-</p><p> cess, and I’m sure others comparable to them</p><p> would be welcomed by the majority of your</p><p> readers. The February issue was the best one</p><p> in some time. The first installment of Fearful</p><p> Rock, as I mentioned before, was superb.</p><p> The Drifting Snow by August W. Derleth</p><p> was a charming and different kind of vampire</p><p> tale, off the trail. The horribly suggestive</p><p> Giant-Plasm, never revealing but still not con-</p><p> cealing something of the terror of that strange</p><p> life. This was a fine comeback for Mr.</p><p> Wandrei. The Double Shadow—stories like</p><p> this one that relate a calm, creeping awful-</p><p> ness, coming slowly to claim its victims, give</p><p> me chills for hours after. It was a very good</p><p> story. Reprint, The Last Horror, was a mag-</p><p> nificent characterization. What a wonderful</p><p> movie that would make! Shapes of Men That</p><p> Were is the best pictorial Finlay has done</p><p> since his return. Finally, the five poems and</p><p> the conclusion of 1 Found Cleopatra com-</p><p> pleted a perfect issue. Kelley’s second story</p><p> was better than his former try, but is this</p><p> weird? I doubt it very much. Very good</p><p> action and adventure, though. Death Is an</p><p> Elephant—fair; The Transgressor—confus-</p><p> ing. Lastly, Quinn’s tale of the little evil</p><p> elemental, v.hich was so logical it was unbe-</p><p> lievable, could not be catalogued. It was good</p><p> except for too much explanation and too little</p><p> story, or something. It just didn’t set right</p><p> with me. Best illustration (not including</p><p> poem) was The Double Shadoiv. Cover—</p><p> very poor; Eyrie—too small.”</p><p> Oogier and Oogier</p><p> Caroline Ferber writes from Chicago:</p><p> "Wow! wotta colorful cover on the February</p><p> issue! And the 160 pages is a dandy treat—</p><p> so much more to read. Finlay’s illustration</p><p> for Quinn’s Poltergeist of Swan Upping is</p><p> exceptionally good.

Hurry with the next issue. </p><p>Glad to see August Derleth again on our </p><p>pages. Although most of his stories run on </p><p>the ghost type, The Drifting Snow proved </p><p>good entertainment—and I like Wisconsin. </p><p>Donald Wandrei’s Giant-Plasm was ok—but </p><p>I don’t care for amebas or stories of them. </p><p>Goody—the wily Cleo done herself in finally </p><p>and so the lovely lass and sturdy hero were </p><p>happy.

Omi mi—the reprint The Last Horror </p><p>was a horror. Can’t say it was ’zackly weird, </p><p>but such an adventure! Horrors! Now for a </p><p>bit of comment on the poemry—Howard’s </p><p>The King and the Oak—excellent! Kramer’s </p><p>Crazy Nell—pathetic. Lovecraft’s Zaman’s </p><p>Hill has almost a Pied Piper theme—on the </p><p>gruesome side. Scanning the Eyrie, it seems </p><p>Kelley and his Egyptian tales are plenty popu- </p><p>lar—into which I cast my vote also. My </p><p>favorite of this issue is The Poltergeist of </p><p>Swan Upping.

That’s an awfully </p><p>commonplace way of describing WT, but the </p><p>fact is I don’t quite know how else to describe </p><p>it. It has me quite hypnotized. Seabury </p><p>Quinn’s story Lynne Foster Is Dead was one </p><p>of the most absorbing stories I have ever read. </p><p>It is as lovely, and fantastic and well written, </p><p>though of course in a different way, as his </p><p>Globe of Memories, which I consider one of </p><p>WEIRD TALES </p><p>157 </p><p>the greatest of all weird tales. Seabury J </p><p>Quinn is one of your best and most versatile </p><p>authors. His stories are always excellent, </p><p>lovely and imaginative and fantastic. I don’t </p><p>think lie gets enough credit. He is one of my </p><p>main reasons for buying this magazine.

Kelley </p><p>A prophetic glimpse info the future </p><p>out and above the rest, to wit, Nictzin Dy- </p><p>alhis’s The Sea-Witch. Why doesn’t this man </p><p>write more? Every time he plies his pen he </p><p>produces a gem—take for instance his Sap- </p><p>phire Goddess—but he plies his pen so very </p><p>seldom. And what of C. L. Moore? Has </p><p>she given up writing? I miss Northwest </p><p>Smith and Jirel. Kuttner’s Elak reminds me </p><p>of Conan, and, as Conan was my very favorite </p><p>character, I am glad that someone is taking </p><p>his place. The same applies to Clifford Ball’s </p><p>heroes—what about some more, Clifford.'' </p><p>Quinn surpassed himself in Fortune's Fools </p><p>and Goetterdaemmerung, and I think these </p><p>two efforts were better than his Roads, which, </p><p>all the same, was a magnificent yarn. Now </p><p>that Hamilton has given up moving the cos </p><p>mos in an off-handed manner, he has turned </p><p>out some first-rate literature, The Isle of the </p><p>Sleeper being possibly the best; though it is </p><p>hard to choose, so good was his stuff lately. </p><p>Bloch seems to have found himself to his own </p><p>advantage—but I am merely repeating other </p><p>people’s opinion.”</p><p> Hope for an Impossibility</p><p>Donald V. Allgeier writes from Licking, </p><p>Missouri: "Congratulations on the larger size. </p><p>The February copy of WT was great. After </p><p>a few bad issues you’ve re-attained your for- </p><p>mer heights in everything except quality of </p><p>paper. I give first place in the February issue </p><p>to the reprint, The Last Horror by Eli Colter. </p><p>I’ve been wanting to read it for years and I </p><p>certainly was not disappointed. It was great </p><p>and entirely different from what I had ex- </p><p>pected. That brilliant speech which brought </p><p>about the black’s suicide was marvelously grip- </p><p>ping. Death Is an Elephant takes second </p><p>place, I think. It’s an unusual tale and very </p><p>well done. Virgil drew an unweird but artis- </p><p>tic cover for it. Donald Wandrei surprised </p><p>me pleasantly with Giant-Plasm. I expected </p><p>another of those interminable yarns of in- </p><p>vaders from space that spread over the earth </p><p>till our hero finds that common table salt or </p><p>something is fatal to them. This story is </p><p>different and is very entertaining. Clark Ash- </p><p>ton Smith is up to par in The Double Shadow. </p><p>So far Fearful Rock doesn’t seem very weird </p><p>but perhaps it will become so. I Found Cleo- </p><p>WEIRD TALES	1*9</p><p>patra let down a lot in the last two Install- </p><p>ments, though it’s still a fine yarn. . . . Kutt- </p><p>ner's ultra-short was fine and I’m glad to see </p><p>Derleth back. All in all, a fine issue. For </p><p>sheer goose-pimply horror, however, give me </p><p>Medusa’s Coil in the January WT. It’s the </p><p>weirdest and scariest thing in ages. Too bad </p><p>the picture was so poor. The Silver Coffin </p><p>was a nifty, too, and Waxworks appealed to </p><p>me. Virgil’s cover drawing for The Fifth </p><p>Candle was great and the interior illustration </p><p>for Bride of the Lightning was even better. </p><p>I hope for an impossibility—that WT will </p><p>continue to improve.” </p><p>Congrats </p><p> C. Wilkos writes from Chicago: "Please</p><p>forward my congrats to T. Kelley for his </p><p>conclusive ending to I Found Cleopatra, which </p><p>takes first honors this month. The reprint de- </p><p>partment is second with The Last Horror by </p><p>Eli Colter, and N. Hindin third with Death </p><p>Is an Elephant. Mr. Quinn’s Globe of Mem- </p><p>ories, Roads, and Goetterdaemmerung ought </p><p>to be enough encouragement for him to for- </p><p>get M. de Grandin.” </p><p>Conan Is Her Favorite </p><p> Miss E. B. Hardy writes from Lewiston,</p><p>Maine: "My vote for favorite story in Feb- </p><p>ruary’s Weird Tales goes to the reprint, Eli </p><p>Colter’s The Last Horror. Closely following </p><p>this fine story comes Fearful Rock (Part I) by </p><p>Manly Wade Wellman. If the succeeding in- </p><p>stallments prove as interesting as the opening </p><p>one, we have a good deal of pleasure awaiting </p><p>us. (Don’t disappoint us, Mr. Wellman.) I </p><p>am glad to learn you are planning to reprint </p><p>Robert E. Howard’s King Kull stories, as I </p><p>missed out on those, though I read his Conan </p><p>stories. Conan was, and still is, my favorite </p><p>Weird Tales hero, and I miss him very </p><p>much.” </p><p>Concise Comments </p><p> Catherine Allen writes from Latonia, Ken-</p><p>tucky: "Please will you reprint The Last Poet </p><p>and the Robot by A.
