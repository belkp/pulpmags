Miss Sheridan mustn't be tired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She needs her strength."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duke left obediently, quickly, as if his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life held only one purpose--Nan's re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning papers carried the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncement that the wedding of Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nan Sheridan to Mr. Rodman Carlton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominent socialite and sportsman, better</seg><seg type="columnLine">known as "Duke," had been postponed</seg><seg type="columnLine">indefinitely while the bride elect was in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital recuperating from an emergency</seg><seg type="columnLine">appendictomy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nan slept most of the day, her bride's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bouquet of orchids and lilies-of-the-valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed in her arms, and as she slept she</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed of Duke whose love had reached</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her in the Valley of the Shadow of Death</seg><seg type="columnLine">and led her back to life again. And she</seg><seg type="columnLine">waked to wonder how she could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following day she felt quite herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside from weakness and a dizzy head, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she suggested that she was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to leave the hospital Duke pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested with surprising violence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Nan, you mustn't!" And then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing the worried crease of her forehead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hastened to add, "If you're worrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the expense, forget it. It was partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fault. I'll take care of everything."</seg><seg type="columnLine">When that did not dissolve the stubborn</seg><seg type="columnLine">set of her cherry mouth, his voice be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came more pleading. "Please, darling. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd had your appendix out you wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be back in circulation the second day. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't want a messy scandal, do we?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reluctantly Nan allowed herself be per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suaded, although she would have preferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little gossip to this new postponement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their wedding. But then she didn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke's horror of a little talk, probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">because her family were neither wealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor prominent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the days which followed Nan's rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness gradually diminished. It was fun</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live in a bower of flowers, to receive</seg><seg type="columnLine">great sheafs of roses from Duke each</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, little cards which she read and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reread a hundred times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duke was not lying when he said^she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never been so beautiful. For the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in months she was getting enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, eating regular nourishing meals. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken a lot of doing without lunches</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a glamor girl on a shoestring in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from part-time modeling jobs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last hectic months were fading in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her memory, those months since Frieda</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glenn's husband had been killed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bataan, and Frieda had come back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York a romantic young widow. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only natural that Duke should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">nice to Frieda. They had been engaged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Frieda met her aviator husband,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Duke and Nan had sat together</seg><seg type="columnLine">that historic night 011 a Fifth Avenue bus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The miracle of that chance meeting still</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the pounding blood to Nan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks--the idea of Duke Carlton falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a strange, penniless model was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to believe. None of the glamorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">new friends whom she had met through</seg><seg type="columnLine">A KISS TO MAKE YOU WELL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke knew quite how penniless she was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Duke suggested that she stay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hospital a third week Nan didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">argue. Secretly she was beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread seeing people again. There might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be some skeptical raised eyebrows, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">requests to see her scar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Powers, the expensive specialist</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom Duke had called in, consented with</seg><seg type="columnLine">reservations. Nan must see more people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out of her room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so they put her in a wheeled chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rolled her out onto the sun porch. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as exciting as a trip to Europe, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke hovering over her, and nurses with</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankets and pillows. They almost ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a lanky redhead who stepped aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let the cavalcade pass. He did it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such exaggerated, disrespectful courtesy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Nan turned and stared after him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their eyes met for a single second, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nan's came away, feeling bruised, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night, when she was being prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for bed, she questioned her nurse, "Who's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall red-haired doctor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tall? Red-haired? You must mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jere Willis. When he finishes his intern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship he's going into the Army Medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corps. Isn't he divine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nan's voice was coolly disinterested.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I wouldn't know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNFORTUNATELY her heart didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow its example the next morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he came into her room, carrying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheaf of records. She thought he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way Gary Cooper would look if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ten years younger and had red hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry to trouble you," he said, pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a straight chair, "but the hospital lacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">your vital statistics." His long body hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why don't you sit over there?" Nan</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to an overstuffed chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wouldn't dare. I might go to sleep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She noticed the dark hollows under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You should try getting some sleep at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night," Nan suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks for the suggestion. I'll men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion it to the next person who calls for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ambulance in the middle of the night."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then, ignoring Nan's quick flush, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncapped his pen.

Watching him</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat a few words would be a refreshing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The course was divided into two parts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two weeks of lectures and instruction fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by three weeks of actual hospital</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. Nan worked faithfully on the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liminary training. She simply had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day the class entered the hospital</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the hottest spring day she had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. The blue pinafore which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked so pretty in pictures felt like</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticking to her sensitive skin. At the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Memorial she sternly stifled an impulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn and run. With knees which felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">like undercooked taffy she slowly climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps to her first day of duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was delighted to find that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were assigning her to pediatrics. A sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby wasn't as formidable as a sick adult.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Nan's delight was premature. Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hickey, the supervisor was a dragon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She shoved a carton of gauze under Nan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose, instructing her to make "B.S.G.'s,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappeared with a swish of starched</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helplessly Nan stared at the gauze until</seg><seg type="columnLine">a student nurse came along and conde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scendingly helped her out. "Heavens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you even know about 'big square</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauzes.' " Nan didn't but she learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning dragged on. At ten o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nan was folding gauzes, and found her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self doing the same thing when eleven</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled around. Her back ached unmerci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully from standing so long in one spot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she was afraid to stop even for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink. It was almost twelve when Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hickey rushed in to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bring a clean sheet into emergency.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll find one in the linen closet," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nan sped away, but there was no sheet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the linen room. A friendly nurse direct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed her to the laundry on another floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When she came back five minutes later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed and triumphant, the door to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency room was closed. Nan knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">timidly and was told to come in. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">room was filled with nurses and doctors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of them was a redhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I brought the sheet," she began</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We couldn't wait all day," Miss Hick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ey snapped, "We used a clean bedspread.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Get an antiseptic basin and be quick about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. And shut the door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nan had noticed an open bathroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and sped to it quickly, but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no antiseptic basin. There were any num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of wash basins. Realizing that Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hickey didn't like to be kept waiting, Nan</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed one of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But again she wras wrong. Miss Hickey</seg><seg type="columnLine">was horrified. "Don't you even know an</seg><seg type="columnLine">antiseptic basin ?" She sent a student</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurse on the errand and Nan crept away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hall, her cheeks burning, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes glazed with angry tears. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve-thirty and she had been supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave at twelve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she washed her hands, so conscien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously stripped of nail polish and jewelry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she resolved that she would never, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">set foot in the hospital again. Why hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Hickey told her w'here things were</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept. Was a brand new nurse's aid sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to have been born knowing all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Memorial's store-rooms?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JERE WILLIS was at the door when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nan left the hospital, waiting to gloat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she thought viciously. Although she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking quickly, his long legs had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty keeping pace with her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just wanted to say good-bye, and it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been nice having you here today."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean good-bye?" Nan</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You won't be back, not after what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. It's one thing to work but quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">another to be yelled at unjustly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The uncanny accuracy of his analysis</seg><seg type="columnLine">took her breath. It also stiffened her</seg><seg type="columnLine">backbone. "I haven't the faintest notion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of quitting," she answered loftily. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me take y&lt;S*i from your important</seg><seg type="columnLine">work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She hoped she was epitome of dignity</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she hadn't much faith in wilted blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">denim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're not taking me from my work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm on vacation for twenty-four long</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heavens!

I'm treating myself to eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours of good old shuteye, and then I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going dancing with a good looking gal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the relief of the Navy. This is my</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. So long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved away with lazy, long-legged</seg><seg type="columnLine">grace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nan used a whole bottle of bath salts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">soak the smell of the hospital out of her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As she lay in the tub, relaxing, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought how long it had been since she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been dancing--weeks, literally. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Duke had become very dull chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren since the initiation of their "all</seg><seg type="columnLine">work" policy. Surely a little play</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be unpatriotic!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duke called her promptly at seven.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're all right, darling?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a newly-acquired concern in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Horribly so," Nan answered, sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly impatient with this solicitude about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her health. "So right that I feel like go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing places and doing things. Don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have some tickets for the Navy Relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">party tonight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, yes, of course. But it's going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be mob scene."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know. The entire human race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think it would be the smart</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for you. Let's drive up along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hudson. 1 know a quiet little place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've never been."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I don't want a quiet little place. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel like swing music and excitement. Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the way, do you know my age?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why you're nineteen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Right. I thought possibly you'd got</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed up and thought it was ninety-one."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was only thinking of you." Duke's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was stiff and hurt. "I didn't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd feel up to facing a crowd."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not. What do I have to hide?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nan replaced the telephone slowly, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkle gone from her face. She did have</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to hide, a cowardly, shameful</seg><seg type="columnLine">something--her suicide attempt. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">could she have been such a quitter? If</seg><seg type="columnLine">she hadn't been so physically exhausted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so desperate financially, not daring to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ordinary job least everyone know her</seg><seg type="columnLine">true financial state. But there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">excuses which could explain away her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinful act.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Possibly she was sticking her neck out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisting on this party tonight. Maybe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she should call Duke and tell him she'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">reconsidered. For a second time her back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone stiffened. Because she had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coward in the past was no excuse for con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuing to be one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To bolster her courage she wore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loveliest thing she owned. It was a dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had earned modelling, which she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended for her trousseau--a lovely blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">marquisette, unexpectedly kindled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an American beauty sash, and a skirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles' wide. The mirror assured her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was a knockout in it, but still she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">some misgivings. Defiantly she elevated</seg><seg type="columnLine">her chin. She was going to that dance if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole world were there to shame her</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their whisperings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HPHE whole world was Duke's world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had become Nan's. Possibly it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only her guilty conscience that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feel she was being scrutinized as close-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly as a saboteur's cache. Everyone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">terribly cordial. "How nice to see you</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, Nan," "Heavens, where have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">been keeping yourself?" and "Have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovered from your operation?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what about the things they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking: Appendicitis, my eye. Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose she'll be able to hang onto him</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this was crazy, she was only im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agining. Nan looked up at Duke, seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">reassurance. But his forehead was creased</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a black frown and he was glaring out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Nan's brown head. Then it must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">true that people were gossipping. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciously Nan followed the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke's glaring eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She recognized Frieda instantly. Frieda</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be wearing black in a crowd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pastels, looking cool and sophisticated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then she recognized the man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Even in a dinner jacket, red hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still red hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duke was moving toward them, cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the dense crowd like a sabre</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a wedding cake. Nan's heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted. So it wasn't over. Duke was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in Frieda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were very close now. Nan saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jere say, "Don't look, but I think we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">being shadowed;" saw the lazy raising of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frieda's eyes, her cool appraisal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hi" Nan said. Someone had to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">18</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shall we exchange partners?" That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Duke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Nan was dancing with Jere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least Jere was dancing--Nan was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a sleep-walker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's not a very funny smile," Jere</seg><seg type="columnLine">said softly in her ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nan started. "Oh . . . No. I don't sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose it is. Something was worrying me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now it isn't, but there's something</seg><seg type="columnLine">else."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I catch. Out of the frying pan into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foxhole."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, that's it." Nan was grateful for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his understanding. "How did you happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know Frieda?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Professionally. She was in the hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pital once," Jere said, studying Nan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frieda in the hospital! What was she</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing there? She's strong as a horse."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I can't answer that one. Professional</seg><seg type="columnLine">ethics. But it wasn't appendicitis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Normally Nan would have skipped it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but tonight she was too raw, too hurt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you knew how ashamed I am, you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">never say that word again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay, I won't if you'll wake up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">really dance. It's tough on my one night</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, to get stuck with two girls with but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single thought."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know what you mean," Nan</seg><seg type="columnLine">said stiffly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes, you do." Jere snapped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers in front of her eyes. "Come out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Never-Never Land, my darling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're at war. Eligible young men with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank accounts and proper draft numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't hang on every bush."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cold fingers of ice clutched Nan's heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You think Frieda wants to marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think it. My God, I know it. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">so do you, but you won't admit it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jere's blunt statement was a dash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold water and Nan didn't like cold water</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be thrown in her face, she preferred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have it served in goblets disguised as wine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But possibly Jere didn't know what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was talking about. After all she had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to trust him that much. "Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're so well informed, what's Duke's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaction?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Duke? That's easy. His bank ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count and torso are above average, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherw'ise he's simply a normal human</seg><seg type="columnLine">being, and being human he's attracted by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Frieda. Now don't stiffen up. I'll prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably cut him out with her, but even if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you can easily make him marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. It's silly to get all steamed up. Duke</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't help what he feels toward Frieda</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more than I can help the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">being close to you changes the chemistry</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my bloodstream."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nan's heart started to cut up capers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heel-kicking, hat-throwing capers, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of her anger there was nothing she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do about it, for the heart is an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntary muscle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your modesty surprises me. You don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">really doubt your ability to make Frieda</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget Duke, do you?" Nan said, hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hide her inner tumult with a veneer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool sarcasm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, that! Jere lowered his voice con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidentially. "Frieda wants a husband--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you all do, and I definitely am not in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">market for a wife. It's a tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">handicap, but I don't mind. Otherwise it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be too easy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of all the colossally conceited asses!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But at the instant Nan was sure she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up her mind about Jere, she looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and found in the amber depths of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes a wicked sparkle, an upsetting, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tagious sparkle. Her smile began staidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her eyes, but by the time it had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mouth it was a rascal of a smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jere gathered her into a rib-crushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">hug. "Come on," he begged, "let's leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sex angle to Freud and have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay, let's," Nan answered recklessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she didn't expect it to be quite so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much fun. Jere went all out in his danc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and his manhandling was a refreshing</seg><seg type="columnLine">change from Duke's gentle clasp. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the first dance her face was flushed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hair a ball of topsy turvy brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold. In the middle of the second dance</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Navy discovered her. It was fun</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching a blue uniform coming to cut in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was more fun seeing Jere work his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the crowd to reclaim her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TfyTUCH later Nan and Jere went out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">H*- the balcony in search of cold beers, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of the moon and their breath. Nan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happier than she had been since</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frieda's return to New York. Because</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no vacant tables they wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered off to a secluded corner to drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">A KISS TO MAKE YOU WELL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their beer, leaning on the wide railing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nan didn't know when she became con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of the other couple in the shadows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think we're not alone," she said soft-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ly-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very observing, my darling. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">your eyes grow more accustomed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimout you'll recognize our fellow coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trymen." Jere lit a cigarette and handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to Nan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Duke and Frieda! Should I go over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take her by the hair ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord, no. We're having fun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too." Jere's fingers caressed the place on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nan's neck where the curls clustered</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickest. It didn't make sense that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">should enjoy their touch so much, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. "Besides you've nothing to worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. You'll get the guy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the second time Jere had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">that statement. "I don't know what makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">you so sure," Nan said sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you." A new ironic note in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice brought Nan's head up quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again she was on the defensive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On second thought I guess I do. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke didn't love me, he couldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made me want to live by kissing me. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that what you meant?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a long minute before Jere spoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when he did his voice was harsh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not exactly, but let's skip it. Gorgeous</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, isn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was not looking at the moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nan squirmed around in his arms until</seg><seg type="columnLine">she, too, could see the couple at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the balcony. They had come to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and were merged in a long, close</seg><seg type="columnLine">kiss. As Nan looked she felt twin stabs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jealousy. Duke had no business kiss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Frieda that way and Jere had no right</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be so angry about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because she was hurt and angry Nan</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted impulsively. "I believe you fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire with fire." With a defiant toss of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head she raised her face to Jere's. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long poignant minute, while his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered over hers, she was swept with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">medley of emotions. What was it going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be like, having Jere kiss her?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did not find the answer, for Jere</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly raised his head. "And I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevention is the best cure." He picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her off the railing and set her on be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered feet. "Come on. Let's go in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back in the ball room Nan didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether to be furious or flattered. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">had Jere refused to kiss her?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd had thinned and Duke had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no trouble making his way toward them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although his wide shoulders took space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was very close before they noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remember you've got him roped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied if you don't spoil it," Jere had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">time enough to whisper a warning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been looking all over for you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where? In Frieda's hair? It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect reply but Jere's eyes kept Nan</seg><seg type="columnLine">from using it. Instead she went docilely</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Duke's arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've had such a wonderful evening,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said as she danced away with Duke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jere's raised eyebrow was a salute, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silly little gesture made Nan happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the way to her toes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Duke suggested that they drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long way to her apartment she laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly refused. "And wear out tires! Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides I have to be at the hospital at seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lingered at the door uneasily. "1</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to dance with you some more, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were having such a rush I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get near."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think nothing of it, darling," Nan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surprised how easy it was to be mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nanimous. "It was sweet of you to rescue</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frieda. Jere should have been spanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for brushing her off so completely." She</seg><seg type="columnLine">yawned. "Sorry not to ask you up, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven comes mighty fast. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brushing his cheek with a light kiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">she slipped away from him. Although she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not by nature a gloater, Nan hugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself all the way up to the sixth floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And she wasn't at all surprised when her</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone rang fifteen minutes later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just wanted to tell you good night</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, darling," Duke's voice came to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a caress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So she had him worried. The shoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't feel so good on his own feet. Nan</seg><seg type="columnLine">giggled as she jumped into bed and pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">off her table light. Jere Willis certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew his psychology. And then her mood</seg><seg type="columnLine">became serious. Again she was indebted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Jere. He had turned what could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been--what had started out to be--a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening, into a lot of fun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was he being facetious when he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">she upset the chemistry of his blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream? Probably. Otherwise he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have kissed her. And yet, on die other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, her logic might be all wrong. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said he didn't want a wife. Possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been afraid to kiss her. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nice thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be a fool," Nan admonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself angrily. "You love Duke. Stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking about Jere. Stop it, I say. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hear me. Stop!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS a thick, hot summer, New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York at its worst. People with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">job felt wilted and depressed, but Nan</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled gamely along with her two.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had never dreamed one could walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">so many miles in a hospital corridor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never known how many supplies one</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed. She folded millions of dressings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But each day brought more interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">assignments, as she was allowed more re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsibility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the hospital people took on new</seg><seg type="columnLine">personalities. A doctor became an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alted personage: even an interne had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be treated with reverence. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost a dream that once she had danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Jere's arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there were days when she wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">she need never see a hospital again, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the whole they were happy weeks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duke was out of town a lot, but on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights they were together he was sweeter</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the last day of her training, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot one early in June. At noon she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeding an elderly man, one of her favor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ite patients. He had a little trouble with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his soup, and she noticed that his breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was jerky, gasping. While Nan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting his meat into small pieces he</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed his eyes, and when she spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him he did not respond. She waited pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiently, hating to disturb him too much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beads of moisture stood on his forehead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a white line circled his lips. Wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried Nan picked up his wrist, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find no pulse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly she snapped on the light, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">several minutes passed and no one came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly Nan's worry became panic. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran out of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The head nurse came in a hurry, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">one look and sent for a doctor. Jere and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the house doctors arrived at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time. They tried artificial respira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but it was useless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, he certainly went in a hurry,'"</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the doctors remarked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nan couldn't believe her ears. The nice</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man wasn't dead, not really. It hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">been ten minutes since she had given him</seg><seg type="columnLine">his soup. If she'd only sent for help when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she noticed his breathing, he might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been saved. What right did she have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">play nurse? She must quit immediately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before she killed anyone else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was a block away from the hospital</seg><seg type="columnLine">and going fast when Jere overtook her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey. Wait a minute. Where are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">going?" He took her arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Home," Nan said, "where I belong--</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I can't do any harm." Her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy with unshed tears, begged him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave her alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're stopping at my place first for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink," he told her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Jere. . . . Please."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Jere was adamant. "I'll kick you</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in half an hour--don't worry. I'm on</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency tonight and I need sleep."</seg><seg type="columnLine">When she still objected, he said, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin, "Don't be coy. My etchings are put</seg><seg type="columnLine">away for the duration."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed incredible to Nan that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once thought him nice. She'd show</seg><seg type="columnLine">him how immune she was to his fatal</seg><seg type="columnLine">charm. "I could stand a drink."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jere's one room apartment was a nest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes and books and unsorted laundry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was lint on the floor and the day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed was unmade. As Nan waited for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to appear with the drinks, she moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">about automatically picking up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he came in, she said severely: "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should think you might keep the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jere's eyes were malicious as he handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her the tall glass. "It's a bad sign when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gal starts looking after a man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the straw too many for Nan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained emotions.

He picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nan up and sat down with her on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair that was the least cluttered. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she could hear his voice it was sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral minutes before the meaning of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words came through to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know how you feel.

"If I'd called someone sooner he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be alive." The sobs rose again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">choking her words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jere waited until she had quieted. "Non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense." His voice was brusk. "He had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart condition which was bound to flick</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off. Nothing could stop it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's awfully nice of you, but--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look at me!" Jere pried her face out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shelter of his shoulder. "There are</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of things people might call me, but by</seg><seg type="columnLine">God nice isn't one of them. Have I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">bothered to lie to spare your feelings?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why of course he hadn't. And yet, Nan</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't dare let herself be comforted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have I?" Jere repeated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--no, you haven't." In the moist</seg><seg type="columnLine">blueness of Nan's eyes appeared a rainbow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of renewed hope and courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good girl," Jere patted her approving-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "Come out into the kitchen and wash</seg><seg type="columnLine">your face and I'll fix a new' drink."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE kitchenette was as immaculate as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other room was untidy. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be sanitary to have it dirty," Jere</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained. "I cook here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had their drinks sitting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white enamel table.

Nan was horrified when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she looked at her watch to see how long</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had overstayed her time limit.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was someone with him whom he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want her to see. It could be but one per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son--Frieda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half way to the elevator Nan was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised to find she was tiptoing. As she</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked slowly home she wondered why</seg><seg type="columnLine">this new blow didn't hurt. Was she</seg><seg type="columnLine">A KISS TO MAKE YOU WELL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">numbed to suffering? She was sure it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only temporarily, that the pain would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it would be overwhelming. But she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would face it this time, take it standing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feet. Because she dared not risk the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long sleepless hours of the night with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">undermining loneliness, Nan called Me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morial and asked if they could use an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tra nurse's aide. She buttoned herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily into a fresh uniform, and called a</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am certainly glad to see you," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head nurse's greeting was cordial. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll answer lights, you'll do a lot toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">preserving my sanity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The corridor looked like Broadway be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the blackout. It was hot and the pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tients couldn't sleep. They wanted fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, or their pillows smoothed, and Nan</seg><seg type="columnLine">went from one to another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the hallway of open doors there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one that was dosed. It belonged to Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams who had hallucinations of people</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to harm him. Thinking how hot his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room must be, Nan opened the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood quietly listening. Satisfying herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he must be sleeping she moved away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the door ajar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she came by it again, a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes later, it was tightly shut. So he wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep. Nan went in to see if she couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do something to help him get some rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the dim light she could see that his bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was empty, and even as she noted it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door crept shut behind her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you're the one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought you'd be more comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the door open," Nan said, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmest voice she could muster. As she</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke she backed toward the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed, hoping to be able to find his light cord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her fingers were on the cord, groping</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the switch, when the hands came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the darkness, and a viselike grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught her right arm. There was a sicken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing snap, a wave of pain and Nan learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">how easily an arm could be broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hands reached her throat. "Jere</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . Jer . . . " The scream died off into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gurgle. The fingers banding her throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wires, barbed wires, digging, cutting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing. Her breath was going. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">her last strength Nan kicked the bedside</seg><seg type="columnLine">table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door must have been opened be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it was lighter. There was a smack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a fist hitting a chin, but Nan didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know about that until later--much later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T^HE smell of sipirts of ammonia was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, and the light blinding when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nan came back to consciousness. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered who the people were and why</seg><seg type="columnLine">they kept hurting her arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually, as things stopped whirling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she recognized one of the house doctors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and two of the nurses. But there should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be someone else. Her eyes groped on until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they found Jere, Jere with a very black eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a scratched cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You seem to make a habit of saving</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life," Nan said, ignoring the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His cocky grin was unsteady. "I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the bows this time. They go to Duke</seg><seg type="columnLine">for being psychic."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he wanted none of her, not even her</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're going to set your arm. I'll be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle as possible, but it may hurt quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit," the doctor told her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did hurt, excruciatingly, but Nan set</seg><seg type="columnLine">her teeth against the pain and clung to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand of one of the nurses. Once Jere came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her and stuck a hypodermic needle into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arm. Because his hand trembled slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, because there were huge drops of mois-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture on his forehead, Nan managed a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuring smile for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last it was over and her arm a neat</seg><seg type="columnLine">white bundle and they wheeled her off into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bed, wrapping her up in spite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She fell into a half sleep and was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of someone calling.

She was fighting against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of that voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a second she opened her eyes but</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed them quickly. It was only Duke as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she should have known it would be, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jere didn't call her "darling."

I tried my darndest to enlist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even tried the Merchant Marine, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">o. I'm stuck in 4-F and that's that. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">usted my knee cap once in a sort of ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck and I've got a silver plate in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee. So they won't take me. My knee's</seg><seg type="columnLine">as good as anything, though. I can hike</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten miles and everything, but try to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vince them! No, they say I'm 4-F and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I'm 4-F. So finally I gave up and got</seg><seg type="columnLine">this job and its swell, after all. Say, I bet</seg><seg type="columnLine">I killed about a thousand Japs this morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. After all, they've got to have muni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, huh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," Sally said. "This is winning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war, too, you know. I'm sorry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, about your knee. Were you a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailor when you were hurt?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not exactly. I had a job on a private</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, sort of. Say, I'm hungry enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat a horse. Where's the cafeteria around</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, anyhow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A cafeteria in a Grant factory?" Sally</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoffed. "Don't make me laugh! We</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring along a lunch pail here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She picked up her red lunch box and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thermos from under her bench and waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">them at him. He looked dismayed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then I haven't any lunch!" lie cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mom always puts in more than I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat." Sally said. "Come on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No kidding? You've got enough?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure," Sally said leading the way into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stock room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They found a packing case near a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">window and Sally spread her lunch out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outside of that window was the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">town of Grantville, Vermont, where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had always lived. It was a grubby little</seg><seg type="columnLine">factory town, built around the ancient red</seg><seg type="columnLine">brick Grant Sewing Machine Factory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only recently the factory had been turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a munitions plant and the town was</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of new' workers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sally poured hot coffee from the ther-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mos and gave Nick a corned beef sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wich. It was as if he was someone she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had always known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean no cafeteria?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cried. "There ought to be a cafeteria</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this crow'd working here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sally laughed. "Maybe you ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">just dash into New York and tell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant Factory board of directors about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it!" she said. "Listen, the Grant Sewing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Machine Factory was founded a hundred</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago by old N. T. Grant, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't changed a thing about it since</seg><seg type="columnLine">then! The factory has just gone on work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing people in the same old red brick sweat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop, making money for the Grant fam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily ! The Grant family moved away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grantville years a^o. They are rich New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York society people today. So what? So</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they had to start making munitions</seg><seg type="columnLine">they only made just such changes as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely had to. Thcv don't care if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat out of a lunch pail!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say!" Nick cried. "That's too darn</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad! Why don't the workers complain?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why don't they protest or something?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sally shrugged. "Oh, they do," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "They asked to have that south</seg><seg type="columnLine">brick wall torn out and glass brick put in</seg><seg type="columnLine">for light, and they asked for a cafeteria</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the girls asked for a decent powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and even the town people have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">after them to put in a decent first aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. But so what? So the Grants keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to cocktatil parties and the board</seg><seg type="columnLine">of directors keeps postponing things, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we keep bringing lunch pails! Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have another sandwich?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nick took the other sandwich. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know much about things here," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I just got in yesterday and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town's so crowded that I couldn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a room. I'm staying in the cook's</seg><seg type="columnLine">room at the local hotel. You don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I could get a room, do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sally knew that he couldn't get a room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The town was that crowded, but she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an idea. If she moved in with her sister</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her two kid brothers took her room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would leave the attic room vacant. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">attic room was private and had its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">washroom and a separate entrance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back stairs. He would like that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We might have a room at my house,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said. "You can come home with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">for dinner and talk to Mom. We've nev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er had a boarder but everyone in town</seg><seg type="columnLine">has to help out now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That would be swell!" he said. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up then and grinned at each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thanks for the lunch, ghoul!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sally smiled at him, her heart pound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Even though a lot of new workers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to Grantville. there were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">very few handsome young men in town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very, very few. And here was Nick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thomas--tall, dark, and 4-F! And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">28</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had dropped right out of the skies into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">very lap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It must be fate. Sally went back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her welding with her eyes shining. Life</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to arrive in Grantville, she de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided. After eighteen years of nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">happening, Nick Thomas had arrived!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped his welding in the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the afternoon to ask, "Got a boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--not really," Sally said and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">red under her helmet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She knew that Eddie Phillips, the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's son, considered her his "girl." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slight, sandy headed and drank too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. He was 4-F, too, from an alco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holic heart. But he was one of the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys left in town, now, so Sally had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">going places with him. She knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddie really meant to marry her. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, John Phillips, the foreman of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">factory, even called Sally, "daughter" in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">joking way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In fact everyone in the little town prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably thought there was a sort of under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing between Eddie and Sally. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there wasn't, really. Sally didn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Eddie. She was convinced of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't have a real boy friend," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said firmly. Because already she knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Nick was going to be her new boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good !" Nick said. "Then you'll show</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the town tonight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sally laughed. "There's one picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">show and two drug stores. There is quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hot competition between the two drug</seg><seg type="columnLine">stores. One of them puts both whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">cream and a cherry on ice cream sodas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other retaliates by giving the cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomers two olives with each sandwich.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's a very wild town! Even a juke box</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the drug store on the corner. You can</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance if it isn't too crowded."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll paint the town red," Nick prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised. "We'll take in both soda fountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">and play all the records in the juke box!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was wonderful, really. Because</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she took Nick home for dinner, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the family liked him. Her mother made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at home in the attic room and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all moved in before dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In fact the late winter dusk was hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a pale lavendar wrap about the shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders of the little town when Sally and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Nick started out to paint things red. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of silver moon hung above the hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the stars were out like jewels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sally had put on her beige coat with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fur collar and Nick was more handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">than she could have believed in his gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">tweeds. They walked down the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks of Main Street and Sally knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone in town would know about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">new man in an hour!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of the Main Street they halt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, for the sidewalk ended. Sally pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the hillside to the pointed turrets of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark old mansion at the top of the hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's our local castle," she said, "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Grant mansion. It's been boarded up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ten years now. Ever since the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's death. None of the younger Grants</seg><seg type="columnLine">have even been back for a visit since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">funeral. Once in a while a servant comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to check things or something, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise it's vacant. An awful waste,</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't it? It would make a swell com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munity center with dances in the big old</seg><seg type="columnLine">ballroom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nick stuffed his hands in his pockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked up at the dark mansion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're darned right," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A ND so then they went to the picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">show and first to one drug store and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then to the other. At the second drug</seg><seg type="columnLine">store they played the juke box and danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a vacant room in back. Other couples</seg><seg type="columnLine">were there and Sally introduced Nick to</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone. Presently Eddie Phillips came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was flushed and angry looking, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sally knew that he had been drinking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sally was dancing close in Nick's arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Eddie came over and tapped Nick's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Break!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've been drinking too much, Ed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">die!" Sally said quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on and dance with me! You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">my girl, you know!" Eddie said loudly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She doesn't want to dance with you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nick said. "So that's that. Go drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">some black coffee!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie glared at Nick. "I've heard all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about you!" he said. "News travels fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this town, you know. You're a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow at the factory, but it sure looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny to me that you have moved right</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Sally's house!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">TALL, DARK AND 4-F</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you mean anything by that?" Nick</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked coldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean just what you think I mean!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "And Sally's going to get her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self talked about!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd hate to hit a drunk man!" Nick</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, would you! Well, you aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk, so I guess it'll be all right if I hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">you!" Eddie hit Nick a hard, unexpect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed blow on his chin that sent him against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a door that opened 011 a porch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nick caught his balance and rushed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddie. He pushed him outside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yanked him down the steps to an old rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel full of last night's rain water. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducked Eddie's head in the cold water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and everyone laughed. But Sally went</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, for she knew how much influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddie's father had at the factory. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew this would make Eddie and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole family furious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They would be furious with Sally, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as Nick, for allowing a strange boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to humiliate their son. The whole town</seg><seg type="columnLine">would probably feel that Sail)' had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">too far. Eddie drank but he was a home</seg><seg type="columnLine">town boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sally was silent as they walked home</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Nick laughed about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you had liked him, I wouldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done it," he said. "He was just jealous</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I could tell you didn't like him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I didn't like him," Sally said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But small towns are funny, Nick. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't like outsiders to come in and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">their girls and stick their heads down rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrels!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You aren't his girl!" Nick cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not any more, you may be sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that!" Sally said and laughed now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then she looked at Nick and knew that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter if people talked about her, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the next few weeks Sally's</seg><seg type="columnLine">life became just so much a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nick's that it was hard to look back to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time when-she didn't know him. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate their lunch together every da}' and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes talked until they forgot to eat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the evenings after they had finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">work they went to the show or sat around</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to other factory workers Nick had</seg><seg type="columnLine">met and liked. Jerry and Lane, two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the factory who were intensely in favor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of improvements at the factory, often</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to talk to Nick because he was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathetic and interested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was as if all her life had been wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one night she awoke from a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep and saw the moonlight flooding her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedroom. A soft whistling sound came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the orchard and she rushed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. Nick's tall, striding form was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming up the lane. Apparently he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone out for a moonlight walk. How won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful ! Sally had always wanted to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the moonlight in the dead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night and had never had the courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow, now, she just had to go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and meet Nick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She slipped quickly into slacks and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">polo coat and ran softly down the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs. The moonlight poured down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white hot and magic, glistening on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dew. Sally had no idea of the time. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">only knew that this was a wonderful night</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she had to be out in it with Nick!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey!" she whispered. "Night owl!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw you and came down! It must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">after midnight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed softly and put his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">through hers. "It is nearly five o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning," he said. "I've been out</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at--at the country side. You'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better get back to bed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And leave this beautiful moon! I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide.awake and you'll have to take me</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking in the moonlight now!" Sally</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, laughing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nick laughed. "In New York five in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning is quite a conventional hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be coming home but I'm afraid that</seg><seg type="columnLine">here--well, do you dare?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do dare!" Sally laughed. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'll show you the top of the hill where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I used to go when I was a little girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so they climbed a hill back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and watched the sleeping town be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low them, wrapped in a veil of moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shivered and he put his arm about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. It was then he kissed her for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time. He just held her to him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put his lips on hers, very tenderly, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetly, and Sally knew that the fire he</seg><seg type="columnLine">set then would never go out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He let her go and said, huskily, "Sally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that--that wasn't the way I meant to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I meant to say a lot of things but--</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">let's go back now!" He took her arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so they went back in silence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sally clung to his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dawn was silver pink and gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they fan, a little guiltily, back along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path. An automobile passed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the misty road and Sally gave a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What will happen to my reputation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nick Thomas?" she laughed. "You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving me big city ways, coming in at</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was nothing to feel guilty</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, really, she told herself when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was back in her room. A moonlight stroll</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a kiss, that was all. Yet she felt as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she had done something wrong, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all day the feeling haunted her. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at five o'clock when John Phillips, the big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-faced foreman, sent for her to come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't ask her to sit down and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke bluntly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sally, I'm disappointed in you. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought you were the sort of girl who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could work along side of men without</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing your head and turning theirs. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think you'll have to leave the factory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't like to fire you. but after all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town is getting full of more mature and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more experienced workers and-- Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can use you in the office later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was fired like that!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what in the world brought this</seg><seg type="columnLine">about?" she cried. "Of course, Eddie is</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry with me but you aren't so little</seg><seg type="columnLine">that--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked her in the eyes. "I passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in a car at dawn this morning, Sally.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You were walking along the road with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that new fellow at dawn! In this town</seg><seg type="columnLine">we don't want a girl who will do that sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thing working in this factory. I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's about all, Sally."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned wordlessly and left. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know whether to laugh or cry. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if John Phillips would tell his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife, and she knew he would. His wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">would spread it and enlarge it. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">scandalize the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had lost her job because she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone out into the moonlight with Nick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come in at dawn! But she kept a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff upper lip about it and passed it off</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually enough at home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too many experienced men are com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to town for welding jobs," she ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained at supper. "They are transfer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring me to the office, but for a while I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be doing nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She told it so lightly that the family</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it casually. Her mother was glad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have her back home to help, especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">since Nick made extra cooking. And Sal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly found that she loved being home, know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that she was cooking for Nick, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">him come home from work and find her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh and lovely, having him praise her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was quite aware that the town was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gossiping but she didn't care. When she</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nick were married, all that talk would</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop soon enough ! Anyhow nothing mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered now only Nick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND so the day came when Nick said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Say, tomorrow is my birthday. Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you going to make me a birthday cake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sally?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And immediately Sally began to plan a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little dinner for him. a cake with candles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She would ask some of the friends he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made at the plant and they would have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">special little dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an unusually warm day in March</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they sat on the front veranda, plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning the birthday. Sally was holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nick's hand and laughing up at him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a car stopped in front of the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both Sally and Nick stood up as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of lovely girls and two men stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the expensive car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who on earth. . . ." Sally cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nick had gone scarlet and he jammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fists into his pockets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Friends of mine from New York," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Sally, I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he had no time to say more. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">three girls and two men had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda and were screaming at him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out to greet them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nickey Grant!" one of the girls yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a shrill voice.

We've planned the most mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velous party at my penthouse.

You can certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away from the old factory for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. After all, it's your factory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sally stood in the doorway, hearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">TALL, DARK AND 4-F</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">31</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">what was said, and her heart just leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her throat. Grant.... Nickey Grant!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and caught her arm and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troduced her to the group.

They didn't object to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting a job at the factory, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it would sound like phony pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licity if it made the papers. Anyhow, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want any favors.

"You didn't write and tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them w'hat Jerry and Lane said, did you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was in confidence! And now they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be fired! Nick, how could you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She clung to his arm, looking up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well!" Diane said. "Fancy! She</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems rather emotional over you.

Sally whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nick was crimson. But he looked into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sally's eyes and said, "That's right.

And it cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly had nothing to do with mathe-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">matics. She could have coped with that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was about twenty-seven and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were as brown as her own hair, full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold sparkles that meant danger. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had unruly, close-cropped brown curls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he probably hated. He was tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even sitting down, and he looked the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man in uniform ought to look, flat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard and broad shouldered. He gave her</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small salute, and a grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She thought, "You're laughing at me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not with me," and she looked away, care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, pretending she hadn't noticed. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">will proceed with the problems for today."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVERY day for a week, she was ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribly conscious of him there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front row. And this class was different</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ones that had gone before. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had an air of gayety about it. And some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how Sue knew that Private Peter Murray</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to blame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one night just as she was leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building he was waiting outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hello, Miss Bow'er." he began. "May I</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk to you about something?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," Sue said. Her heart was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating a tattoo against her ribs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's about that newest theory you ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained to us. I can't quite get it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her heart stopped pounding and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to normal. "I'll help if I can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I certainly would appreciate it," Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, taking her brief case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wondered desperately what to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">next. He was evidently seeing her home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Actually, arithmetic is fascinating," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">began. "It isn't difficult if you get started</seg><seg type="columnLine">right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a girl, and yet you think in</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms of algebra and geometry!" There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was awe in his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said defensively, "People don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how interesting those subjects are."</seg><seg type="columnLine">But she knew she really didn't care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter helped her aboard a double-deck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er bus. "Miss Bower, did you ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop to think that maybe you're missing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot? I mean, you've been teaching this</seg><seg type="columnLine">new class a w-eek, and nobody knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything about you. You discourage all</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts at getting acquainted. You act--</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of frozen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sue said crisply, "My job is to teach</seg><seg type="columnLine">arithmetic to soldiers, not to provide a</seg><seg type="columnLine">central heating system!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">TEACH ME TO LIVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be angry, please!" Peter argued</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously. "I know I'm barging in. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I like to see everybody happy, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first day, I've noticed your eyes are</seg><seg type="columnLine">sad. You look afraid, as if life were pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing you by. What you need is to thaw out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's easy if you know how."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sue's heart had started going too fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. But she wasn't angry any more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter Murray's voice somehow prevented</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. It was so quiet and friendly. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something about it she couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have explained, something that made her</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on listening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What I wanted to suggest," Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on politely, "is that if you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">help me with the toughest mathematical</seg><seg type="columnLine">problems, off duty, that is, I'd show you</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to let go and have fun. Oh. I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sounds presumptuous, but I know all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about you. You look as if life were just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a problem in geometry. But it isn't, Sue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every day ought to be exciting!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you . . . really think I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn?" she asked, hesitantly, reminding</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself that there was nothing personal in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suggestion. It was just a bargain, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">busines transaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You ought to be dating a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier every night!" Peter asserted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you could." He sketched a vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. "You're cute, under that icy ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior. All you need is to be taught how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have fun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sue couldn't be angry. She knew he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was right. Peter's brown eyes had pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated the icy wall between her and hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piness. Joan would have told him to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, that she could run her own life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she didn't say that. She knew she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would grasp at any chance which let her</seg><seg type="columnLine">be near Peter Muray. "All right," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I'll help you with mathematics and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you . . . can teach me how to live."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How about beginning tonight?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested. "I'm at liberty for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours. We could get off this bus and go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a place I know where we could have din-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner and dance. And then we'll fix a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to study."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She knew in her heart that for a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go with Peter, she would have agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to almost any idea. So she said, "All</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, Peter, if you really think it'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth my help tutoring you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I really do." He grinned. "When</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we're finished, I'll be a mathematical</seg><seg type="columnLine">shark, and you'll be the siren of the Army</seg><seg type="columnLine">Air Force Technical School."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went to a little cafe on Rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street, where the specialty of the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">was spaghetti, and you chose your music</seg><seg type="columnLine">from hundreds of records. They danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sue had the sensation of floating in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter kept speaking to people he knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his grin was a bright magnet warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">as sunshine. Sue felt suddenly alone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the midst of the music, thinking of how</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible it would be to go back to a life</seg><seg type="columnLine">that didn't include his smile. And yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would have to, unless she somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">miraculously became the kind of girl he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After they danced some more, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner, it was time to go. Outside, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked a little while down Michigan Ave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nue. "Thanks for tonight," she told him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost wistfully. "I guess you were right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What I need is to thaw out. I didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to start."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've started now," Peter grinned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was crazily thankful that he needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">help in mathematics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next day she went to class in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress she had considered too festive</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. It was beige, with a red belt and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright red patch pocket. She didn't just</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine it. The class was different that</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. Several of the men smiled at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she was explaining problems. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiles were almost flirtatious, amused, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sue ignored the amusement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter came that evening for his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesson. He had to leave early, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had time for some intensive work. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they began, Sue asked. "I'm doing better</seg><seg type="columnLine">already, don't you think?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter pretended to examine her. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly are. Several of the fellows in</seg><seg type="columnLine">class noticed, too. Before the term is</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, you'll be dating all of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I want just to date you!" She</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost said it aloud. To cover embarrass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment she hurriedly began explaining a</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult problem. Peter listened all eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning. He wasn't nearly as ignorant about</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures as she had thought. He learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">very easily. If he had any difficulties it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was probably because he was occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was just preparing to go when Joan</seg><seg type="columnLine">came home to dress for a late date. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was adorable, all gold and cream loveli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. Sue couldn't miss the look that</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed between Joan and Peter. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look of genuine interest, of challenge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kind of look Peter had never given</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly she knew she was dreaming a</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate dream to think Peter would</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever think of her as anything but a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joan was saying, "I believe I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter. We met at a party."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tom Grayson's, wasn't it?" Peter re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered, or else he was just inventing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the spur of the moment. "This is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first chance I've had to really see you. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the party, the stag line was three deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">around you. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later, he had gone, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was panic in Sue's heart. Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't belong to her and she knew it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just doing a good deed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joan took off her make-up. "So Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the one responsible for the change in</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Sue. I was sure you looked differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sue protested, "I'm afraid that was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">optical illusion. I'm just helping Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his studies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a relief. Peter Murray is strict-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly for smarties. He lost his amateur rating</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Prince Charming long ago. You can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be an amateur and date him without get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting hurt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sue felt incredibly that something in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side her was slowly freezing. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time she saw him she had known he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth and popular.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning she used a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade of lipstick, painting her lips just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way Joan did, into a shining red curve</seg><seg type="columnLine">which dominated her pale, small face. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pallor didn't just come from not wearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">rouge, but from a strained feeling about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the students asked her, eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">mockingly humorous, "Miss Bower,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're slipping. If you wear that much</seg><seg type="columnLine">lipstick, we aren't going to keep our</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds on our work. It's sabotage, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In fact, the whole attitude of the class</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed changed. Even though it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed in words, Sue could sense it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was as if every one of the soldiers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching, seeing the ice melt away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. But she didn't care. In fact, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS Friday night, and Peter made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a date for Saturday. "It's your turn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sue. Tomorrow night we'll polish up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fine points of a siren's technique."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He grinned, "Of course there are some</seg><seg type="columnLine">things you have to pick up for yourself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forget about mathematics and let your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sue thought, I don't want to be a siren</seg><seg type="columnLine">except to you. I like the way you laugh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way you know life will always be</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrilling. But aloud, she said, "I've made</seg><seg type="columnLine">up my mind to make a success of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It isn't a problem. That's been your</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. Life has been all problems in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematics, and no fun!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She knew it would make her late, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she went shopping after class. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckless, extravagant, and told the sales-</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, "I want something dangerous. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for a siren!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For you, Miss?" she was asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dubiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in the end, she found just what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted, a black chiffon formal, appliqued</seg><seg type="columnLine">with black chantilly lace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she selected new makeup, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied her own image and was aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished. Her eyes were lustrous, her lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted in expectation, her chin reckless</seg><seg type="columnLine">with determination. If Peter Murray</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked sirens, she would be one! Time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting short, she knew that. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be finding someone who didn't have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught about life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She even had time for a quick hairdo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Saturday afternoon, in a down-town</seg><seg type="columnLine">salon. Her dark brown curls were cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, feathery and sweet about her face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning it into an ivory heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter was already waiting for her when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she reached the apartment. He and Joan</seg><seg type="columnLine">were carrying on an intimate conversation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joan said brightly, "I've entertained him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sue, darling.

I think it's the best thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever happened to you, honestly I do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was as if someone had thrown cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">water in Sue's face.

I've tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain it before, but you never seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested. But now that you're out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your coccoon, here's the lowdown: Be</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefree. Expect life to hold something</seg><seg type="columnLine">romantic every day. And remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a two-some is more fun than a lone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sue said defiantly, "I'd rather find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">by myself, Joan!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She went to her room and while she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dressing Joan's date called for her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So when Sue came into the sitting room</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter was alone.

Then he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned, the old, easy-going, let's-have-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fun, Peter Murray grin. "Hi, here, siren.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shall we go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY went to Camellia House, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Buttery, and the Chez Paris.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sue's feet moved magically to the music,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though perhaps it was because Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew how to guide them.

It was noisy and crowd-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, and they didn't have time to talk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was enough to dance with Peter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to realize, over and over again, that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known his kiss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little later he discovered there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just time to put her in a taxi and get back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his quarters. The night had vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost weirdly. It might almost have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Sue came in, Joan was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">removing her makeup. "Hello, darling,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said. "You look as if a star had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded in your hands and covered you</seg><seg type="columnLine">with glitter dust. Or am I wrong?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've missed so much, Joan!" Sue</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I've been locked in a cage of ice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Or a cage of mathematics," Joan said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sue didn't tell her about Peter. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to keep the knowledge of her love</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret for a while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the next day there were no mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages on the telephone stand, and all after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon the telephone stayed maddeningly</seg><seg type="columnLine">still. Sue spent Sunday afternoon wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her hose and doing various odds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends. And still nothing happened. Noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, that is, until after she had gone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was the sound of a key rattling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lock, and Joan's voice, breathless,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">saying, "Thanks, Peter! I'll never forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">today. Nobody ever took me on a winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">picnic, before. You have wonderful ideas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Life will never be dull for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the door closed, plainly as any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, Sue heard Peter's voice. "Thanks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joan. You're pretty exciting yourself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're the kind of girl a soldier dreams</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being stranded with some place."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then there was a short silence, long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for a kiss, before the door closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sue was trembling with anger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartbreak when Joan turned on the light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You dated Peter!" she gasped. "When</seg><seg type="columnLine">you knew. ..." Her face flamed as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized she was a fool to show her feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joan took off her sweater and skirt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She said, "Listen, Sue, all I knew was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you had some sort of business ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangement with Peter. You were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to teach him mathematics in return for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few helpful hints on being a success with</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. He may have been romantic with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you last night, but don't you know you</seg><seg type="columnLine">should never take a man of Peter's type</seg><seg type="columnLine">too seriously? Just because you dated</seg><seg type="columnLine">him once doesn't mean it's permanent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men like Peter don't play for keeps."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sue turned off the light. "Would you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind undressing in the bathroom?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Joan. "I want to go to sleep."</seg><seg type="columnLine">What she meant was that she wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide, there in the dark, in case she cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All her life, she had been facing facts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that was what she did now. Joan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. Peter hadn't said, "I love you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had just kissed her, and she'd jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to conclusions without waiting. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly arrived at the wrong answer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She'd flunked at love, even if she was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiz at geometry. Both she and Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">were successful teachers. He knew about</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, and she could do complicated arith-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE morning, she had to go to school</seg><seg type="columnLine">as usual. She didn't want to, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew her duty. She was a little late, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to do something about her tear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravaged eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now, she was her new self. Short</seg><seg type="columnLine">bob, perky and cute, lipstick shiny and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright as a model's, she wore one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joan's bright sweathers. It was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">effective. She could tell that when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">went up to her class-room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TEACH ME TO LIVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was in perfect order, of course, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was the Army. But she could almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel the little gasp of attention that went</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the men as she took her place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sternly, she began the lesson, not looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Peter Murray, but she could sense his</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence. It was a savage torture she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to have to endure, learn to ignore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But how can you ignore heartbreak?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead of standing there in her new hair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">do and makeup and scarlet sweater, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to run away and hide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The class was finally dismissed. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men filed past her desk, she heard one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them say, very low, "My money was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter Murray. He knows his girls as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">does his arithmetic. He was an account-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant in civilian life, and he certainly trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed teacher."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter was one of the last to go out, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't march with the rest. He said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sue, what's wrong with you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Somehow she managed to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">through stiff, cold lips. "You'd better go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter. I learned about your little joke by</seg><seg type="columnLine">accident just a second ago. I guess I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have known it all the time. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have guessed! I should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known last night when you dated Joan."</seg><seg type="columnLine">As long as she lived she would remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber his eyes, intent on her, as she went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on recklessly, "It was sweet of you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help me, especially since you knew all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about mahematics any way. You don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">need asistance with anything, do you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She turned to go, but he held her, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers tight about her shoulders, "Listen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sue, I'm risking plenty by talking to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I ought to be on my way to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">class. So you've got to let me talk!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She struggled. "Let me go. I was silly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take for granted that your kissing me</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than a part of my education.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You taught me how to live, and I'll never</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget the lesson. I guess learning it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little hard, but after today it will never</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt me again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a lie," he accused; his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hard, determined. "If you don't let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me finish, there will never be a moment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">when the memory of this doesn't hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. The truth is, Sue, I made the date</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Joan before you and I went out. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">were late getting home, and ... I guess I</seg><seg type="columnLine">still thought of myself as footloose. Sue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to understand this . . . every man is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventurer until he finds the right girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conquest is fun. When I saw Joan, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess I acted according to habit." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, then began again, "I didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">I loved you, Sue, until later, when I kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. You can't hate me for that. I doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you knew it, either. It took me all day</seg><seg type="columnLine">to realize that I didn't want to date Joan</seg><seg type="columnLine">or anyone else, and that though I was sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posedly trying to teach you how to live,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was getting an education myself. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">learning how to love. I didn't ever want</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to know about the joke part. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just that soldiers have fun, they have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a joke out of everything else. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a bet that you could be a siren, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derneath that icy exterior, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. But--I'm sorry, Sue. I'm sorry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I want to forget it. All I want to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to love you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're sorry for me," she retorted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anguished. "Please, Peter, don't make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">any worse by being sorry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would take more than sympathy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make me go A.W.O.L. from my next</seg><seg type="columnLine">class!" he told her. "I'll meet you out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the hotel when you're finished." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">kissed the tip of her nose. "I can't go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the day with lipstick on my face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that will have to do," he said, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember, darling, when I transform a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl into a siren, I want her for myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just ignore any soldiers you see, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a small kiss, not like the one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two nights before. But she knew suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he wasn't sorry for her. He shared</seg><seg type="columnLine">her thankfulness for love. He disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the corner in the hall, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished intently that it were evening, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was waiting for her, outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stood there, not sensing the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage of time.

He thinks Julia is quaint.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He says there are enough girls named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Candy and Babs and Gloria already."

It was seldom early.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day he said grimly, when they hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to be alone in the studio, "Saun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders isn't going to like these pictures."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes widened. "Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your late hours are going to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in them," he said. "To say nothing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those last three drinks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She wrinkled her nose and laughed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "But he bought the drinks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Laugh while you can, beautiful," Paul</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "If you're tired of being a model,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's no concern of mine. There are plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of models. And you can always find an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her elfin face was suddenly breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takingly radiant. "Paul," she said, "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you a secret. It isn't the job that mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters any more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His heart sank. "No?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head. "No," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It isn't the job now. It's the boss."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul groaned out loud. "You little</seg><seg type="columnLine">idiot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stared at him, looking a little hurt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for once unable to laugh off his gruff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He straightened and put down his pipe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I figured you were one girl who might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to keep her head in this crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">business," he told her bitterly. "Can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see that Kip has only been building</seg><seg type="columnLine">you up? It's always this way with each</seg><seg type="columnLine">new one he discovers. She's the only star</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his heaven as long as she is new. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">--plop! That's the goods, beautiful. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone in the business knows it. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">every year for Saunders. Each year a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new favorite."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed, a little uncertainly. "Paul,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you old grumbler! You are a bad-weather</seg><seg type="columnLine">prophet. But you don't fool me! You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">just trying to scare me into getting some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, aren't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not trying to scare you. I'm only</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to pound a little sense into your</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty head."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came closer to her. Surprisingly, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was really angry. His heart was beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard with anger. He took off his glasses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked at her with a sober intensity</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his dark eyes that she could not laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not teasing you," he said quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why else do you suppose Kip is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful, unless it's because he can al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways work up enthusiasm for a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">type? Last year it was the 'Wheat Girl,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clean earthy country beauty--Linda</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adams. You've heard of her. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what kind of jobs she gets now. Buff</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed her until the advertisers were sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her face. Now you're it. The elfin</seg><seg type="columnLine">type. Next year it will be someone dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent. And where will you be?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped, a little surprised at his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensity. She was sitting in the prop</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, staring up at him, her eyes wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her face a little pale. He had got</seg><seg type="columnLine">under that thin skin of hers, all right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can tell you where you will be," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said brutally, "and it isn't going around</seg><seg type="columnLine">with stars in your eyes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She winced and he turned away, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be sorry for her. It was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">she should be told.</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They finished the pictures in silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she was either thoughtful or offended.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She left with a brief "Bye," and he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">swearing to himself as he got ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next job.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The look in her eyes stayed with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought, "Maybe, I'm wrong, I hope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe Saunders is going to marry her."</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the thought gave him no comfort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and anyway he knew better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He growled at his next appointment, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">newcomer, "Why didn't you stay on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farm?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And milk cows, with these hands?" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl said, pertly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grunted.

Not for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">years had Saunders had a model so suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful. Paul thought he knew why. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty was not the kind one tired of. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man might always find new things to ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mire in her clear, laughing eyes, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine of her hair, and the haunting elfin</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression of her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the advertising public was fickle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reminded himself cynically.

He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cold chill, and at the same time a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">revulsion because the story was disgust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly splashy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul grabbed the telephone and shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed at the inoffensive operator. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had Kip Saunders on the line he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What about Julia,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, hello, Paul!

I'm sorry if I sounded un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling, old man," Kip apologized easily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I thought you knew.

"What a terrible thing! How did it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all in the paper, I suppose." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not interested in how just now. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rushing back and forth across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, looking very young and distraught.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm going to the hospital. They prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably won't let me see her, but I've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try, anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A taxi accident!" Aunt Sarah ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, bending her head over the paper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he was on his way out of the apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, she said, "Paul, they've used one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your pictures--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swore at her and never realized he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doing it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They wouldn't let him see her that first</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. He realized finally that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not talk his way past the starched white</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragons at her door. And so he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the street to a bar where he sat for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long, gloomy time over a drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next evening they let him see her</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few minutes. She looked unbeliev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably slight under the white hospital cover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let, and the bandages that almost com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely covered her head and face gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twist to his heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But her eyes laughed up at him as clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as happy as ever. "Paul! How nice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you to come!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you know enough to stay out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of taxis?" he growled.

"I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">STAR IN MY HEAVEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">busy, haven't I? Maybe I needed a rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buff told me not to worry about a thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isn't that sweet of him?

"Hardboiled as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, aren't you?" But her eyes laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul did not smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nurse said, "That's all for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time," and he went soberly away, worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FEW days later Kip Saunders called</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at the studio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Paul?" he said, his deep voice vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brant with excitement. Paul could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at his desk, big and broad shouldered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and confident. "Paul, I'm sending over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new girl. She's on her way now. Hart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, her name is. Babs Hartwell."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another Babs?" Paul said dryly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saunders ignored his interruption.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She's terrific. She's the type I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for, Vickers. Dark and sophisti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated, yet sweet, if you get it. And plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of come-hither in her eyes. If her pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures turn out as I expect them to, she's</seg><seg type="columnLine">going up like a rocket. In fact, she won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to go up. She can practically start</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the top. I can have the big fellows beg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging for her in a couple of weeks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sounds good," Paul said, still in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry flat tone. Kip Saunders' optimism</seg><seg type="columnLine">reacted on him like a mouthful of vinegar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How is Julia?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Who? Oh! Julia Forrester." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrant excitement noticeably faded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kip's voice. "Well, I'll tell you frankly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vickers, there isn't much chance she'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to come back. The doctors are</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing a wonderful job on her face, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, and of course it's too soon to tell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there is apt to be a certain stiffness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those made-over faces. Ever photograph</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul wet his lips. "No," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can't fool a camera, you know." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed, his hearty, confident laugh. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should lie telling you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah," Paul said. He put down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone. His teeth clenched tight over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe and his knuckles were white as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked up and down the studio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before his anger had worn off, Babs</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hartwell arrived. His first look at her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">told him she was a natural for success.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had that kind of flawless beauty that</seg><seg type="columnLine">artists paint, yet there was enough in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividuality in her features so one would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not forget them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew just by looking at her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she w'ould be photogenic from almost any</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle. Besides that, she had sparkle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. The wiseness in her inviting eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">tantalized, and she was not in the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">shy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul put on his gruff act. "So you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a model, do you! What percentage</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you think there is in it, anyway?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled a little. "Suppose you let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me worry about that," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She would get ahead, all right. No need</seg><seg type="columnLine">to worry about her. Paul posed her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot rapid fire pictures--full face, three</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters, full length, right and left pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">file, and sent her back to Saunders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ducked out of the studio then and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered a big basket of fruit and an arm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">load of flowers and all the latest magazines</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to the hospital.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the weeks t^at followed, he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">Babs Hartwell's star rise with a pain he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it hard to reason away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should quit this business," he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. "I'm getting soft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was clear from the start that Kip</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saunders was behind the Hartwell girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all his dynamic energy. When she</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to Paul's studio, she didn't chatter</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her appointments the way Julia had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. But he knew that she was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">very busy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had a quiet, business-like way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting things done which she hid behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deceivingly languorous air. It was a funny</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, but Bab's hardness didn't show in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pictures. It almost didn't show up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. She was so lovely to look at, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot about the little gleam m her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was nothing but calculation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Paul had not been so familiar with</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty as to be unimpressed by it he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have missed that look of hers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">catalogued him Attractive, useful--but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">importantly so. He knew it; he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in girls' eyes before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One night he ran into her at a popular</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightclub. She was with Kip, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost swaggering as he showed her off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feeling a little sickened, Paul left quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to avoid meeting them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next evening he loaded himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with flowers and candy and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the hospital.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found Julia thinner and quieter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was pleased to see him, and touch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly appreciative of his gifts. But she</seg><seg type="columnLine">plucked nervously at the coverlet as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last she said, "They're going to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">move the bandages at ten tomorrow, Paul.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kip is coming." She hesitated. "I--I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost forgotten what I look like. I'm so</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to being a mummy." There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehension in her voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He picked up her pale hand and held</seg><seg type="columnLine">it warmly between his. ''Now I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're well," he said. "Vanity rears its</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly head. 'Will I still be beautiful?'</seg><seg type="columnLine">she wonders." His tone was lightly jeer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She moved impatiently.

Your eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">are all I can see now, but they haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were moist, all of a sudden, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lashes swept down to hide them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him.

The time</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved in slow, deliberate minutes. Ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock came at last and after that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock on his studio wall seemed to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">still.

"They don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">last long in this game; do they, Vickers?</seg><seg type="columnLine">We know that. The public wants novelty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Babs Hartwell has it. They're crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul controlled himself with an effort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all true. He had said the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">things over and over again. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Julia this would happen. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">still had an overwhelming desire to lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands on Kip Saunders, and violently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the man must know that Julia was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">love with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said, "About Hartwell.

I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty busy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kip sounded annoyed. "Can't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeeze her in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't be done today. I'll try tomor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, Vickers, this is important--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tomorrow!" Paul said, and slammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the phone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said to his assistant, "I'll be out</seg><seg type="columnLine">all afternoon," and turned his back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fellow's wide stare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't stop to buy flowers or maga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zines this time. He went straight to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital and was admitted at once to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Julia's room. It was sunny and filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers. She was sitting up in bed, wear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a pretty bed jacket and her hair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">STAR IN MY HEAVEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like a golden cloud around her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, beautiful!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She didn't smile. There was a fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened, cringing look in her eyes as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought his first reaction. He sat down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bed and reaching over took her chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand. Turning her face from side</seg><seg type="columnLine">to side he looked it over quizzically. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last he said, "Mind if I kiss it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She drew her breath in a quick little</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasp. He bent over and kissed her square-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly on the lips. "Got to christen it, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know," he observed dryly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She began to laugh, but her laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">got all tangled up in tears. "Oh, Paul,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you clown! Is--is it so terrible?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Feeling unbearably awkward, Paul re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated into his familiar, comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruffness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So now she wants me to tell her how</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful she is!

Kip didn't say much,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul's heart ached with a dull, hurting</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger. He could imagine so well the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene that occurred this morning. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew exactly how Saunders must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done it--going all vague and impersonal</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of a sudden. He was a master at</seg><seg type="columnLine">backing out of a situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">- Paul said unhappily, "The camera sees</seg><seg type="columnLine">things we don't. But is that so im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," Julia said, after a long pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were talking around the bush</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they both knew it.

There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no way for him to relieve it without curs-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Saunders.

"Most any time," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kip has been grand.

Instead of stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping for a glass of beer or a highball with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of his friends, if he stopped at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was to pick up some flowers to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, or a book he thought Julia might</seg><seg type="columnLine">like.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her appreciation of even the smallest</seg><seg type="columnLine">gift gave him the keenest pleasure he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever known. He delighted in thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up little surprises to relieve the monot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ony of her convalescence. His aunt teased</seg><seg type="columnLine">him slyly and even that pleased him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some obscure way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Julia was growing stronger but she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still very thin.

"Julia, I don't like to rush you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I wonder if you are feeling well</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to help me out at the studio?

As he brooded, drink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing little, he decided that he could stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">it no longer. It was torment no man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stand, to have her so near day after</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, loving her as he did. He had to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out if there was any chance for him, any</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance at all, even if it drove her away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he returned to the apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">late, Julia was curled up in a corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sofa with his discarded paper.

"I'm going to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to the Circle Club."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked incredulous. Then she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When, Paul?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lit his pipe before replying, "Sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urday," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HER excitement was touching and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little frightening. Before her acci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent, an evening at the Circle would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have meant so much to her. Paul made</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself edgy and miserable wondering if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the possibility of seeing Kip Saun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders that stirred her so. He knew she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone there often with him in the old days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the "boss--not the job," mattered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just in time he remembered to send her</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers. "You're lucky," he told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she thanked him for them. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the thoughtful type."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed. "I've noticed that," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, with a tender note in her voice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made prickles run along his spine. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wasn't gratitude he wanted. His edgi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness increased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aunt Sarah beamed on them both when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were ready to leave. Paul called a</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxi and they went down to the foyer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Julia said, "You--you haven't told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I look?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A little pale," he said. "Otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite lovely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The taxi came and he put her into it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave the driver instructions. Julia</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat close to him and reached for his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a special kind of beauty treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment a girl needs sometimes," she whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered. "It--puts color in her cheeks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives her confidence--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul's pulses drummed. He knew what</seg><seg type="columnLine">she meant. He wondered again if she took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pleasure in tormenting him. Almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily he took her in his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hunger to hold her that he had sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed for so long surged over him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">held her close and kissed her as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">always wanted to. With a sigh she relaxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his arms and her lips clung, sweet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft beneath his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was she thinking of Kip?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an effort he put her away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "How's that for treatment?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, his voice sounding rough in his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She straightened. "That helps, thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," she said. She sounded queerly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mote through the pounding that still filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the rest of the ride they sat apart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a rather stiff silence. As soon as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at the club and were seated at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table Paul had had reserved, he or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered champagne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another beauty treatment," he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Julia. For she was still pale and her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked a little strained. He realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she must be dreading meeting all the cafe</seg><seg type="columnLine">society acquaintances who had not seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">her since her accident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lifted his glass and said, "to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loveliest girl here!" That brought a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile to her lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost at once people began crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">around their table to greet Julia. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper he ordered was scarcely touched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the dishes cooled and lost their inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est while they talked with friends and</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquaintances who stopped by. Julia was</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking happier and more like her old</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, as they told her how lovely she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking at her critically and as imper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonally as he could, Paul thought her</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty was as arresting as ever, with only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a haunting difference, so slight you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sure what it was. Certainly only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camera could single it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he realized what a poor judge he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. His love for her had grown and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deepened so much since her accident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">STAR IN MY HEAVEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed to him her beauty had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deepened, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The floor show was over and the lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just gone up again when Babs Hart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well came in, followed by Kip Saunders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Babs saw him and waved. He beckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her and with a little smile she led Kip</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward his table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All eyes followed her. She was wear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing white and her dark eyes and shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark hair made a striking contrast. Kip</seg><seg type="columnLine">towered behind her, big and confident and</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful looking. They were a strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly handsome couple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul stood up. He spoke to Kip, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted Babs warmly, devoting himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her so that he would not have to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">Julia greet Kip. But even though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not look at them, his ears picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the sharp silence that fell between them</seg><seg type="columnLine">after they greeted each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a gorgeous creature tonight,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paul said quickly to Babs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tonight?" she pouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grinned. "Don't quibble. It isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">often I make pretty speeches." He ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured to a chair. "Sit here. You'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a drink with us, won't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her dark intimate eyes seemed to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of secrets between them. "Of course,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said, smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I'm sorry!" he said, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushing, and introduced her to Julia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Babs barely acknowledged Julia's greet-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and turned back to him. "Paul!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said, laying her hand on his arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Those bathing suit pictures you took of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, remember--" She was off on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">story. But he was conscious only of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation that went on between Kip</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Julia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard Kip say, "It's good to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Julia.

But though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he strained to hear her reply, it was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">low he couldn't catch it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kip said, in an altered voice, "Julia!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can't mean that!" Feeling like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eavesdropper, Paul suddenly stood up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pulled Babs to her feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's dance," he said. "Excuse us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you two?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Julia looked up at him with eyes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were strangely dark.

The anger boiling up inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was changing to bubbles of laughter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt a great surging happy release.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did you mean it when you said Kip</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't matter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course I meant it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pardon me," he said, and turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heel. He hurried back to the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had left. Babs looked up with bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest on her face.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took off his glasses and laid them care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully on the white tablecloth beside Babs'</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening bag.

He found himself being</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried outside. Julia appeared beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and he heard her ask the doorman</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get them a taxi. He couldn't see her</seg><seg type="columnLine">very well. She was a movement of blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">above which her face was a blurred, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch. He realized then he had left his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Julia wouldn't let him go back for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.

But let him be tall and loosely knit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sun-burned hair and shy eyes--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of a soldier who wouldn't even be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to wear a major's uniform without</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking like he'd gotten dressed in a wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel--and then let him stand in the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of a huge, quiet place like the high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">domed rotunda of the library, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward with an expression of rapt won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der on his lean, serious young face. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of him drew Peggy to a sudden halt</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of a sudden twitch at those over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly-sensitive heartstrings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Talk about green, she thought.

Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">that look of rapt astonishment crossed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.

She said, "Mine is Peggy Jones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I work here, in the Literature and Phil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osophy room downstairs.

"Rain never hurt anyone," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I always used to go tramping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rain back home." He added with</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear-cut homesickness, "Only the rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">in California is different somehow. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't sting your face like a good, hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northern storm and there's no thunder or</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning with it. And everything is green</seg><seg type="columnLine">already, so Spring doesn't show much."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He paused. "I always liked Spring bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter than any other season."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unaccountably, Peggy heard herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">protest earnestly, "But you can still feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring here in California.

"Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Jones. You sure can." There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something different about his voice, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then he said hurriedly, "But I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to go now.

She was so wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, terribly in love with Bill--she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much love inside of her that she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">even let some of it overflow toward this</seg><seg type="columnLine">shy young soldier from North Dakota.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She wondered if he would come back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would be fun helping him find some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else to read besides Dickens and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shakespeare. She bet he'd like Jack Lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don and Conrad and maybe even Heming-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. He was naive but he was no fool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She could tell that by his eyes. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the structure of his face was good. Daniel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Webster Whitney .... She smiled mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly. Somehow it made a person feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot better about the war just knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dan's kind was in there pitching. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then abruptly her thoughts shifted to Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">PLEASE DIAL L-O-V-E</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">again and there was no room for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next time she saw Dan Whitney,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a month had passed. It was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Monday evening, less than an hour be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore closing time. She looked up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her check desk at the door of the Litera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture and Philosophy Room, but for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment nothing registered. Not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dan had changed, but lately, Peggy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">apt to stare at her best friends and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass them right by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gosh!" he exclaimed happily. "Hel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lo,	Miss Jones. I was scared maybe you</seg><seg type="columnLine">might not be here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello," she said briefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some high school girls came through</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their arms loaded and Peggy stamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out their books. She could feel Dan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes on her pale, set face. She hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bothered about crutch lipstick and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bad circles under her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they were alone again, he leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the desk and asked in a low, wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried voice, "Have you been sick since I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw vou?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you don't look so good, Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped aside and let her stamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">out some more books and then he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Is anvthing wrong?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh God! Nothing much! Just that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill doesn't call me and tell me he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean what he said, I can't stand it any</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer. Can't . . . can't . . . can't . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She realized she was digging more deep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaningless doodles on a pad of paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sharply pointed pencil held in fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers that were cold and trembling. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw down the pencil and looked up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bewildered young soldier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Part of her wanted to laugh at his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression and part of her wanted to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wild storm of sobbing. She hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried once since that night a week ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Bill, not once. She had just waited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now unless this galoot took his lean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">North Dakota face away from her desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was liable to do anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said, "I'm sorry, but you can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand here. You'll find the Shakespeare</seg><seg type="columnLine">over there and the Dickens there. If you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">want anything else, you'll have to look in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the files. You know-- A B C for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">author's name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She wanted to hurt him and she suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded. She wanted to hurt anything that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came near her, that kept her mind off Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that phone call that must come--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to come! There was a limit to how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much anyone could stand. Pride had</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept her from phoning him, but even pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">can crumple under sustained pressure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dan didn't move away, however. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "W'hen the library closes does that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean you're through work, too?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes.

She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dreadful headache and her eyes felt dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hot. She glanced up at the clock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged wearily. "If you want to," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said in a toneless voice. "I'll be at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fifth Street entrance about nine fifteen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But if you're not there I won't wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be there," Dan said quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now and then Peggy glanced in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction as he wandered slowly around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shelves, taking down an occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">book, handling them all with an almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverent gentleness. He finally carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big, hefty volume to one of the rear ta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles and began to read.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the closing bell rang, he filed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all the rest of the late customers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">catching her eyes for just a second, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly begging for a look of added con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmation that she would meet him out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peggy nodded curtly and continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamp out books. When she finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out into the damp, foggy night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came up to her and took her arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They walked downhill on Fifth Street</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Broadway. The neon-brightness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the downtown streets had disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the strict dimout. There were no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">window shoppers. People walked quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and apparently with purpose, or stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">indoors. The old traffic jams were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory. Now it was mostly busses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">street cars and taxis. But the darkened</seg><seg type="columnLine">theater marquees still drew in plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">late movie-goers and the bars, were over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowing. And Peggy noticed there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still plenty of couples going places, arm in</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm as she and Dan walked--only it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been Bill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stiffened and Dan stepped a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from her.

It was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if she had to hurt inside like this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone else ought to share it with her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She answered him in a stiff, constrained</seg><seg type="columnLine">little voice. "It's a very trite story. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">uninteresting.

Dan suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her lips twisted sharply in the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, like a spasm of pain. "A very at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tractive fellow," she said. "The kind who</seg><seg type="columnLine">does everything better and smoother than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other fellow you ever met. She could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have added, The kind you think you'll die</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you can't get, and then if you do get</seg><seg type="columnLine">hint, you know you'll die if you ever lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She dug her hands deep into the pock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets of her trench-coat and threw back her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, trying to draw the damp, foggy air</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a breast that felt bruised. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an almost physical taste of bitterness</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on," Dan said gently.

Dan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daniel Webster Whitney smiled up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. His eyes were warm and under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing and the shyness was gone out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DAN was true to his word. He showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at the library about the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next evening, read until closing time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then took her to the bus stop. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time the whole atmosphere was dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent. It was almost friendly again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieter, easier. There was no mention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill, and Peggy realized it had helped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to talk about him to someone. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear and the pain were still there but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could camouflage them well enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discuss books with Dan and make a show</seg><seg type="columnLine">of interest in what he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When it became really bad was after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of her tiny apartment closed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind her and she was alone with that tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone--when the waiting lay ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her . . . second after minute after hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, knozving that Bill must call because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had promised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing with her back against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, she suddenly remembered that aft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernoon when she had first seen Dan</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in the library rotunda. But was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it possible anyone could really have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">as happy as that? She tried to recapture</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feel of that happiness, but it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been easier to recall the feel of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing summer sun on a winter mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her emptiness and fear and loneliness</seg><seg type="columnLine">were like evil forces that swept through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bright, neat little rooms, chilling them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the colors cold and the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own movements hollow in her ears. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">black depression seemed to creep out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls and pile up around her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood looking at the telephone. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited so long and hard for its ring, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if she might not scream when</seg><seg type="columnLine">its shrill sound finally broke the echoing</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'm a fool, she thought desperately.</seg><seg type="columnLine">W'orse than a fool. Girls don't act like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this nowadays. They don't let anything--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even love--throw them off strides.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Relax, Bill had suggested. Take it all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> with a shrug.

Maybe every girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world wasn't the same. Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them just couldn't relax. Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some of them love was still a fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eningly intense and magical thing, a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flame-red witchery and torment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion, with all the ancient powers it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had possessed in the days of Juliet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heloise and Isolde.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the fear of that black, icy de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression crushing down on her the min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute she was alone, which kept her from</seg><seg type="columnLine">protesting when Dan got on the bus with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her Wednesday night. It kept her from</seg><seg type="columnLine">protesting when he got off with her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked as far as her apartment house en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said hesitantly, "I don't suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd feel like asking me in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all right," he interrupted quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know how you feel.

She shook her head apologetical-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. "Isn't it awful to be so full of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own importance?

It was just there. He wasn't even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">offering it to her. He was just telling her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he wanted to wait around with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the man she loved got ready to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">her back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was strange what different forms love</seg><seg type="columnLine">could take.

The colors in the green-and-amber</seg><seg type="columnLine">chintz and the taupe rug and the apricot</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls came out all bright and warm again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and somehow Dan's voice and his oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casional laugh completely destroyed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoing hollowness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT night and the two that followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unlike any Peggy had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. During the entire year that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone around with Bill, she couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember one evening passed quietly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her apartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill wanted his entertainment in a state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of perpetual motion, in bars and night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clubs or parties at his Hollywood apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. He made pretty big money at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">studio and he liked to spend it with ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">propriate sound effects and plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">technicolor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A night like one of these with Dan</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have driven him crazv-^-just lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tening to the radio, talking or remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably silent, a game of gin rummy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an argument over Hamlet, a short story</seg><seg type="columnLine">read aloud, and then when it began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow late, a stand-up snack around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">refrigerator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dan talked about his folks and the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">North Dakota farm where he was born</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raised.

He described the hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">summers and the wide fields of grain</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving along the four horizons and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny little school house and the games</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and his four sisters used to play in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big barn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once when he finished telling her about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mother, she thought stunned, "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't even know if Bill has a mother!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And once when she asked him to fix a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken lamp connection, after seating</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself on the floor, he glanced up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have caught a startled expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her face because he said quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's wrong. Peg?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "N-Nothing." she replied unsteadily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Only--only don't get a shock."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was she who had gotten the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock. Because all at once she realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these nights were exactly as she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictured her married life. But that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">before she met Bill and knew their life</seg><seg type="columnLine">together would be something entirely dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent. Not that married life, even with</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone like Dan, would be so placid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the war and everything, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely disturbing to find her old dreams</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly alive, even for a few short hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And once she said abruptly, "Dan--</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you think a girl can offer a man too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much love? So that he--he suffocates?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He scratched the side of his lean cheek</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that gesture she had come to know so</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. "Well," he replied slowly, "My pa</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to say the finest wheat in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't grow in loose sand and only a fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">would sow it there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a strained silence, she said in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight little voice, "But suppose there's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">where else to sow it but in the sand?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's always another place," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you're not in too big a hurry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as Dan was leaving Friday night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was Peggy who suggested that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend his last night "going places."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said bravely, before she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">change her mind, "If Bill phones me, he-</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'll just have to phone again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A look of joyful eagerness crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dan's face and she watched him valiantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to deny it with a protest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As long as I won't know whether Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">called me or not, I'll pretend he didn't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That way I won't feel any worse than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've felt for the past two weeks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crushed her two hands in his.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Peg. . . !" he exclaimed.

And by the way--the girls are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all in spangles."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She managed to get the phone back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its cradle and then she remembered Dan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was too late to remember Dan.

Dan</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Bill had phoned while they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, she would not have known. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">a person doesn't know can't hurt her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what a person does know can be sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaven or hell. And she knew. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of Bill's voice was all warm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive for her again and she knew he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted her with him. Dan wouldn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggest she give up that heaven. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, it was only a last night of furlough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good-bye between friends against--</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Bill and the coming to life again</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her very existence. Dan wouldn't ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a sacrifice.

Her brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair was brushed about her erectly held</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in a warm, shining halo. Except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for being much too pale, she looked poised</seg><seg type="columnLine">and utterly lovely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And there was Bill! He had her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his, and the thrill of his touch leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through her, flame-like.

She was seventeen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his car had broken down in the little New</seg><seg type="columnLine">England town where she lived. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom-built model, and considerable time</seg><seg type="columnLine">was required for the parts to reach her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's garage where it was being re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had dashed in one day when Philip</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impatiently fretting at the delay. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">exasperation ebbed at the very sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her laughing, delicate face, her bright,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-tossed hair. Crystal was fascinated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Philip's jovial high spirits. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never known anyone quite like him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked of far places with charming inti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">macy. Compared to the' sober-faced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling high school boys whom she</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally dated, he was a cyclone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaiety. Crystal was the luckiest girl that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was even interested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To her parents' dismay, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">married a week later in the white-spired</seg><seg type="columnLine">church.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Days after she discovered Philip's high</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits came from a bottle, that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">incapable of determining when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. The bright sheen of their love</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been obscured by her constant watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness and his resulting irritation. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had banked heavily on the arrival of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby. Philip would settle down then, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching fatherhood failed to awaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">his responsibilities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crystal had gone alone to the hospital.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pips was born and nearly died. She didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know where to find Philip. The despera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of fighting such an intangible foe</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly unseated her reason. She grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin and haggard, a despairing replica of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seventeen-year old bride. That's when</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father had taken matters into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and insisted that she leave her hus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">band. The shock of losing her jolted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip to earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She suddered remembering his hysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal pleading.

She would help him fight this dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again her father took matters out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands. She could remain with Philip</seg><seg type="columnLine">only if he entered an institution, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived medical care. To her utter amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment Philip agreed. He was willing to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to any extremes to keep his wife and child.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her father even accompanied him to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reliable hospital, but his shaggy knit brows</seg><seg type="columnLine">testified his doubt that Philip would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough to rehabilitate himself. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father did not live long enough to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result of his ultimatum. The excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and worry brought on a heart attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">which proved fatal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one ever knew of that year in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital, the exultation Crystal felt when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip progressed.

Crystal liked and admired</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall, rugged executive--until the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mark drove his car over the steep em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bankment killing her husband who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an unavoidable accident.

"Marriage! It isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hot resentment flayed her.

How can you say that? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">were responsible for Philip's death, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as surely as if you had pulled the trigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a gun. The accident was hushed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of your name, but you know and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you are no better than a murderer."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are hysterical."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She covered her trembling with defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance. "I was never more sane in my life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It isn't that I want anything for myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pips is the only one who matters.

Mark asked softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You won't if you have an ounce of</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor. I believe the Jansens pride them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves on their honor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instance his blue eyes blazed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. It was as if she were looking into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stormy sea for an incredible heartbeat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crystal was afraid of this stranger to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom she was making such a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposal. But she quickly brushed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehension aside. By every code she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was justified. The law said a life for a life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was demanding a father for Pips by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mark chucked the little boy under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimpled chin. "Maybe you are worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecking two lives for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crystal rose. " Don't forget you wrecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip's." she reminded him. Her legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wfeak. She felt like a silken thread</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn to the breaking point. She knew she</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't stand much more. Her purse con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained two dimes and some pennies. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mark refused, in her present mental state,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she might do something ghastly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at Pips swinging his fat legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the desk. Love and despair were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in her eyes for Mark to read. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling hands spoke of endurance dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerously near the cracking point. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">color had faded from her cheeks. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so white Mark walked around the desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll make the necessary arrangements</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the wedding," he said quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crystal swayed a little. She knew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm arm was supporting her and his anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious gaze was on her face. "When did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you eat last?" There was deep concern in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so long ago," she lied faintly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pips injected honestly, "Mummy didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Pips, we'll eat now. By the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to be your new daddy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pips thought that over. He said "Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you going to kiss Mummy ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crystal straightened. She stammered</seg><seg type="columnLine">very low. "Please, Mark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mark paid no attention to her protest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course, I'm going to kiss Mummy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Matter-of-factly, his lips brushed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unexpectedly her resentment flared</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him. It was like him to take ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of her. As if reading her thoughts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyebrows arched mockingly. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry. This is simply a business deal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staged for Pip's sake. I haven't the slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est intention of touching you any more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than necessary. I imagine I can recognize</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate when I see it staring at me. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe me, the emotion I feel at this hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up isn't exactly love, or anything near it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TTHAT sardonic promise alone sustained</seg><seg type="columnLine">her through the nourishing luncheon</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a quiet restaurant. She and Mark spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly at all, although Pips chattered in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessantly, filling the breach between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once Mark left them with the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent excuse of a telephone call, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crystal had the anxious thought that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reconsidered and was walking out. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't matter now. Nothing mattered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had the detached feeling as if she were</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewing a rather poor play from a gallery</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat. The words were muffled, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't keep her mind on the action.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somehow it would come out right in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Mark returned he carried a cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage of tiny pink rosebuds. Crystal's hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so cold she could hardly hold them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said mockingly, "I'd like Pips to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember something pretty about this</seg><seg type="columnLine">wedding."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the same dispassionate vein, she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted, "Thanks, they are lovely." She</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not wear them to her marriage, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined with disdain. There was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pretty about this wedding, nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacred. The sweetness of the flowers was</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply a taunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when the three of them reached City</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall, the flowers were still on her shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, their fragrance making her a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">giddy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mark secured the license with a mini-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mum of delay, although a long queque</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffled by the window. The waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">period was also mysteriously waived.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again Crystal was reminded of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence of the Jansen name. The same</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff who so conveniently listed Philip's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy as an unavoidable accident, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the ceremony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mark produced a diamond band. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have secured it when he bought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers. In a panic she wondered what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">should do with Philip's ring. It had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been off her finger. At the proper time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, Mark simply slipped his glitter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing band on her third finger. It was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">large it covered Philip's ring, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't right, either.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was when they were coming down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide stone steps of the Municipal Build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that someone hailed Mark. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crystal saw the tall girl, with black hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slanting dark eyes, exquisitely dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a mink coat. Her laughter held all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assurance of security.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her gay, bantering voice called up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mark, people m this town go to City</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall for two things--to get married, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to jail. Which is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dull guilty red spread over his cheeks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were blades of cold steel. Crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew in a brief, vivid flash, this girl meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to him. There was a possessive</seg><seg type="columnLine">audacity in the way she laughed up at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crystal's hands were ice, and her heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped beating, waiting for his answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came at last, hopelessly slow. "Crys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal and I have just been married, Toni."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He made the introductions in an expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionless tone. Toni was too stunned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say a word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until Crystal and Pips were</seg><seg type="columnLine">installed in Mark's suite at the town's</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading apartment hotel that she was over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come by the enormity of the step she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">MARRIAGE ON DEMAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">just taken with such great haste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mark made sure that they were both</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably settled. Then said, "I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">go out for a while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Toni. Crystal supplied the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently. Her lips twisted in scorn. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to give Toni some explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this sudden marriage. So far as Crys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal was concerned, he could devote the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of his life to Toni, provided he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a father to Pips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On his way out. Mark had dinner sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. Crystal and Pips ate in quiet absorp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. The food tasted like ashes. Pips was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinated by his new surroundings, by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuffed dog that had arrived with the din-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. Crystal had difficulty getting him</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled in the big bed in the guest room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mark had pushed it up against the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">so Pips wouldn't roll out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he was asleep at last, the reaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in. She crawled in beside him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried noiselessly, hard racking sobs that</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore at her heart. She wished this reckless</seg><seg type="columnLine">d^y undone. The urgency that prompted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to take the lives of four people into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands seemed unimportant. She and Pips</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have managed somehow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was daybreak when she dropped off</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep. Mark hadn't returned. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, she found his bed hadn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next lew weeks dragged by in</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbed monotony. Whatever Mark's</seg><seg type="columnLine">social obligations were, he was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for dinner. His conversation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crystal was brief and remote. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">real only when he played with Pips. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes would go so blue, the tears would</seg><seg type="columnLine">sting at Crystal's eyelids. His laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hold a deep heart-breaking note.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a frightened dismay, Crystal real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized Pips was his vulnerable spot. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a two-edged sword, that Pips returned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">love. He would leave her at the drop of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hat at the sound of Mark's footsteps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At noon one day Mark brought home</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sad-eyed black spaniel for Pips. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">playful little puppy frisked about Pip's</seg><seg type="columnLine">short legs, tumbling him to the floor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">licking his face. Mark went into gales of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter with him. For an unbelievable</seg><seg type="columnLine">half hour, the polite barrier between them</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumpled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I always wanted a mut when I was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">kid," he explained to Crystal. "And my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother wouldn't have one, because of hairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the furniture and the fleas in the rugs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every puppy I coaxed home, the S.P.C.A.</seg><seg type="columnLine">got eventually."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hope stirred in her heart. Mark was</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to her as if she were a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">being rather than some horrible creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had forced herself into his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Every boy should have a dog," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We never had a house, either. My fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther travelled, and we lived at a hotel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All hotel rooms look alike. I have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories of a place that was our own."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Poor Mark!" she breathed trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture a small boy with crisp bronze hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and troubled blue eyes. He must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very lonely little boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I grew up I managed to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the things I wanted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sickening flash she knew it didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">include a wife, another man's son. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">went rigid with shame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mark rose at last. "I must be getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the plant, but I am going to knock</seg><seg type="columnLine">off at four o'clock. I'd like to take Pips</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the zoo."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crystal wanted to ask if she could go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, but the words stuck in her throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She couldn't risk a curt refusal. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't endure seeing the bleak hardness</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtaining Mark's eyes. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding this feeling within her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">soared at his pleasant nod, or sank at in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference in his gaze. But she deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to be ready when he came at four,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if he indicated by the slightest word</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was included in the invitation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would lose no time in accepting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her plans went awry, for after Mark</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, the puppy howled. Pips couldn't nap</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the disturbance. Over the phone die</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager informed her in an ominous tone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Madam, no dogs are allowed in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment house. Your lease will be can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celled unless you get rid of the animal."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He added as an afterthought, "Mr. Jan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sen's lease also specifies no children."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pips cried when she broke the news to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him about Blackie. He hung on the dog's</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, and the puppy whined louder. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">people in the adjoining apartment knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">threateningly on the wall. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to do but to get Pips dressed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">go out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crystal thought they must have walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the block a dozen times when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mark brushed into them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She couldn't help laughing, "We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">put out, the three of us. Your lease says</seg><seg type="columnLine">no dogs and no children."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glowered at her for a minute, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to signal a taxi. "Okay, we'll rent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a house. Pips should have a place to run."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before she knew it. the four of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the back seat.

"No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mark, I don't think you'd better rent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">house." No one knew what an effort it</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost her, because suddenly a house with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden for Pips to play in, seemed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most wonderful place in the world, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house Mark had always dreamed of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently he didn't notice her hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his sleeve.

What</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happening to her that she could still</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel the warmth of his mouth? She would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not meet his gaze, fearful he would read</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her eyes the knowledge she refused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit to her heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Staring straight ahead she stammered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We can't go on like this.

"No. I won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">give up Pips."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TT WAS a lovely house that Mark final-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ly selected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like it, Crystal? How about you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pips?" Mark asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crystal nodded, her throat too full for</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. That kiss was still vivid. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">step was a new link pulling her into a dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous abyss. She had demanded mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage, but she had the feeling she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be ultimately consumed in her own fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pips made no answer. He was thump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hard on a high key on the piano. Crys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal crossed to him, sat beside him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upholstered bench. "I haven't touched a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piano for years. Come, sing this little</seg><seg type="columnLine">jingle with me, Pips."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That piano saved her pride.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the thoughts that flew after him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he strode down the hill to the plant. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew intuitively he was seeing Toni. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's exotic fragrance clung to him. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon emptying the pockets of an overcoat</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sent to the cleaners she found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">MARRIAGE ON DEMAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jewelled compact. Crystal slammed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dresser drawer hard on the shining orna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. There wasn't the slightest reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world for her to feel a twinge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealousy. She knew Mark loved Toni,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if it weren't for the demand she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made on him, they would have probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">been married. She was caught in a trap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her own making, but she lived for those</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief glimpses she had of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jingle book grew thick with songs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She sketched Pips' chubby figure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blackie, and the gray squirrel that scam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered across their frozen garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mark happened upon the book one day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crystal came into the living room to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">him playing the piano with one finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked across at her, and the clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue of his eyes turned her heart complete-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly over. "Say, this is clever. Crystal. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you publish it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crystal had been pulling Pips about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden on his sled. There was snow on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fur hood, her cheeks were cold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright. She had never seemed lovelier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shrugged, tossed off her jacket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood. "I made them up for Pips.

"What is the matter?" she asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">frankly. "Something at the plant?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The plant is all right. It's--it's Toni.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She is getting difficult. Making wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">threats. I wish you would avoid her if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she does come out to the house. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry, Mark.

" You</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't made a good job of it? What have</seg><seg type="columnLine">I done?" Then she was sobbing against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broad expanse of his shoulder. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mark patted her shoulder. He let her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cry it out. "It's all right, darling," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She wasn't sure about that "darling."</seg><seg type="columnLine">It might have been a trick of her imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the French doors, Pips called for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride. Her heart fluttering like an uncaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird, Crystal went out to him. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved to Mark slithering down the steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">incline. They built a snow man with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper hat and Blackie dug at its feet, send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing snow flurries in all directions. Crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed and Pips squealed, and it was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if everything was right in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When it was dusk and Pips' nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed from the cold, they went in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A ND there was the girl, Toni, beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully at home in Mark's favorite chair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ash tray heaped with stubs indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been there a long time.

Genie ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "And that old hatchet faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">zinnia told my sister that she couldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apartment on account of Tommy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That old hatchet faced zinnia." Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked dryly, "is a friend of mine.

The only reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">my sister wants that particular apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment is because it is absolutely the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished one vacant in this city, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it is near the new Air Depot. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">see. she wants to be with her husband,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Thomas Garden-- as much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible until he is sent to Africa, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Australia, or Russia, or one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">places on the other side of the globe--</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially with the baby coming."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyebrows soared. "Oh. there's go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to be another child?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded. "In a couple of months,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less, and they're terribly thrilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it.

However, Tom wants her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sarah wants Tom and who am I to</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge ? So I've brought her to him again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'm going to stick around until she is</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled comfortably.

His frown</seg><seg type="columnLine">widened.

"We're bof</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did he say bo]?" Peter inquired of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Genie, who was standing in the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the living room wearing a rare costume</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewel of a smile and a compelling outfit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of grey flannel with a red dotted blouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a giey beret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid he did," she retorted gaily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You see, it's his birthday and I promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a party.

Besides,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his Mummy and Dad are dining with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the C. O. tonight.

She placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy between them in Peter's blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadster and he chattered away about</seg><seg type="columnLine">airpanes and jeeps and sheen guns as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they streaked down the parkway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They dined in state at the Lakeside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inn with Tommy sitting in a highchair</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them.

He made a tremendous fuss over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy's birthday, ordering a cake with</seg><seg type="columnLine">five candles, singing "Happy Birthday</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dear Tommy," in an elastic accordian-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenor voice, and insisting that they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat him to a Wild West movie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a double feature, and long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last villain was slain, Tommy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping noisily, his head on Genie's lap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet stretched across Peter's ktiees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they reached the apartment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter shoveled him into bed and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">by while Genie took off his coat, cap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes and socks.

But when lie ushered her into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his car, she found the front seat partially</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied by an enormous Kerry Blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terrier, who stared at her out of doleful</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Susy Q," Peter announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly.

There was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fragment of a kiss between them, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">even so, it was somehow different. Often</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the past disturbing months Genie had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated to Sarah, and to many of her girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends who were marrying and snatching</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few weeks of so-called happiness while</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could, that no man's kiss could dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turb her, clutter up her life with camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">following and heartbreak. She was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulnerable, thank goodness. Yet here she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was feeling suddenly tender and startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and angry and frightened over practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">no kiss at all!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Susy Q growled at her and Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. "She's jealous," he said. "To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow night I'll leave her at home."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There isn't going to be any tomorrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">night," Genie said darkly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Still afraid of me?" Peter challenged</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and Genie shook her head vigorously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DEEP in the night Genie told herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the smart thing for her to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to exit with a whole heart. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised herself to leave the next day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sarah was comfortably settled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment and Tom could come home for</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunch often.

She prepared breakfast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunch and dinner and washed all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy's clothes. There was no time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to pack her bag or see about a ticket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward late afternoon another reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for staying over materialized. The Belle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point tenants had greeted the newcomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">with annoyed stares, especially Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stone, the hatchet faced zinnia. She lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hall with an astonishingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful daughter who had gray-green</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and taffy-colored hair. Genie de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided it would be a fine idea for her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make at least one friend in the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Sarah to turn to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when she met Mrs. Stone's daugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter in the hall and threw out her friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liest smile as a trial balloon, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl glared at her coldly and disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her own apartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh well," Genie muttered. "Sarah has</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom and Tommy and Phyllis, and I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in a few weeks when there won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be any Peter Henderson around to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicate my life.

"Nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever calls me Mr. Layton."

She hadn't had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the least intention of doing any such</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing; in fact, she had fully intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell Bing Layton all about herself before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they parted that night. But he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so boyishly pleased over what he termed</seg><seg type="columnLine">"his good deed for the day," that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't had the heart to disillusion him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not just then, anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left her at her apartment, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blithe, "Don't worry about your back</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent, now; I'll see that you get an ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance first thing in the morning so you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take care of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she had every intention of writing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a note in the morning, explaining the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She awoke at sunrise, feeling oddly ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cited, and decided abruptly that she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the job after all. It might be an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting experience, and, as an author,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she needed all the experience she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get. didn't she? Besides, she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying for weeks to get started on a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">book, and so far hadn't written a word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Working in a big newspaper office might</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggest some idea for a plot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when she had put on a trim little</seg><seg type="columnLine">beige suit, with a lettuce green blouse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a perky green hat pulled down on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">curls, she looked in the mirror and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little face at her reflection. "Shame on</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Ann Creighton," she said aloud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you know perfectly well why you're do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this. You want to see Bing Layton</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and you're afraid if you tell him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth he'll feel so ridiculous over the mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take he made last night that he'll never</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to see you again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, she would have to tell him</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometime, but, perhaps, when he got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know her -- and like her -- maybe he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But two weeks passed and still she</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't told Bing, and certainly it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he didn't like her. As for Ann,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from almost the moment she saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again that first morning, she had known</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was in love with him. And she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">always believed so fervently that love</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be based on long friendship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutual likes and dislikes! How could</seg><seg type="columnLine">she have fallen in love with a man about</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom she knew next to nothing? That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was what she thought that first day--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But after two weeeks of lunching with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bing every day and going out with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">every evening, the trouble was that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew too much about him. He didn't like</seg><seg type="columnLine">career girls, so how could she tell him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was one? He definitely disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved of a poor man marrying a rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, so how could she tell him she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting richer every day, when his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">salary was a mere forty-five a week ? And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst of all, one day when she mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fair Tomorrow, just to see what he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, he exploded. "That cloying, ado-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lescent melo-drama!" So how could she</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly tell him she had written it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If he falls in love with me--and, please,</seg><seg type="columnLine">God, let him!--I'll tell him then, she fi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nally decided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, almost as though God had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that little prayer and answered it prompt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, it was that very night Bing told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">he loved her!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Driving home from a late movie Bing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped the car abruptly at the corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had run into her that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What gives?" Ann asked, with a puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled glance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slipped an arm about her shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew her close, tilting her chin with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand.

"Shall I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded, her heart suddenly pound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because right here is where I first</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the girl I love, the girl I hope to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make my wife." His eyes held hers for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, then he added, "Will you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ann?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," Ann told him simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then she was crushed in his arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips hard against hers, their hearts</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding in unison, and there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reality except this miracle that had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened.

Smart, yes, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">too smart--an old-fashioned girl, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants nothing more from life than to</seg><seg type="columnLine">86</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">make a home for the man she loves."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh, dear, Ann thought miserably, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">really not at all like that! "Do--do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it's really so important, what two</seg><seg type="columnLine">people are like, as long as they truly love</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other?" she asked in a muffled little</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course it's important," Bing</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled. "Oh, I'll grant you that a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">might fall in love with a girl who didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit his ideas of what he wanted in a wife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he'd be a fool to marry her. A mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage like that is jinxed before it starts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Take me for instance. There was a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">--before I met you, of course--when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have fallen in love with a girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Marcella Drayton. She's a darn</seg><seg type="columnLine">attractive girl, but I just wouldn't let my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, because I knew we'd never make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">success of marriage. Her dad owns the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morning Clarion, you know, and, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, he's a millionaire a couple of times</seg><seg type="columnLine">over--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Marcella Drayton!" Ann sat up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, I--" She stopped abruptly. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had almost said, "Why I went to Beverly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall with Marcella," and that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have done, since it certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't fit into the background Bing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufactured for her. Instead she fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished hastily, "I've often seen her picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the papers. She is lovely, Bing."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coward, she told herself scathingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why didn't you admit you went to school</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Marcella, and use that as an open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to tell him the whole thing? She</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply had to tell him, but when and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was ever going to do it, she couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next morning, before she left for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office, her publisher called and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her he was giving a cocktail party for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of their authors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the Green Room of the Hotel Roth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moor," he told her, "and as it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">given quite a bit of publicity, Superb Pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures Eastern representative insists that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you attend. They'll have photographers</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for some still shots to be used in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the advance publicity of the picture."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it's come, Ann thought, replacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the phone with a none too steady hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll have to tell him today, before that</seg><seg type="columnLine">story breaks in the papers--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Bing had already gone out on an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">assignment when she arrived at the of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fice, and by lunch time he hadn't re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. Ann could scarcely get her work</seg><seg type="columnLine">done for watching the door, praying for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to come so that she could get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordeal over. When, a little after four, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the clang of the elevator door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid footsteps in the hall, she was half</seg><seg type="columnLine">way across the big room before the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, with a little gasp, she stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite still. For, instead of Bing, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marcella Drayton walking straight toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, in a trim, black tailored suit, blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">fox furs swinging from her shoulders, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black turban, with a wisp of veil, on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sculptured blonde curls. Ann saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">much before she turned and fled for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny cubbyhole of a rest room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she had scarcely closed the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little room before it opened again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Marcella stood there staring at her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, Ann Creighton!" she exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What on earth are you doing here in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clarion office? And why were you try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to avoid me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Marcella," Ann said weakly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I--I was hoping you hadn't recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For heaven's sake, why not?" Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cella's thin brows rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ann's mind whirled, but she could think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of only one thing to do: Take Marcella</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her confidence and ask her to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">her secret until she had had a chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain to Bing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you see, it's like this," she be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan. "I work here as a copy girl, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's just a sort of gag--I mean I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">really need the job. I--I just took it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">collect material for my next book. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be a romance with a newspaper</seg><seg type="columnLine">background. Handsome young reporter</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero--you know the sort of thing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your next book?" Marcella broke in</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a puzzled voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, you see, I--I'm Lucinda Low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ry," Ann stammered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'll be damned," Marcella said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then her china-blue eyes narrowed. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I still don't see why you have to be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious about it. Even if you are a</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful novelist, there's no reason why</seg><seg type="columnLine">you shouldn't work as a copy girl if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to. Come on, Ann, give! There</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be more than that to it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">LOVELY LITTLE LIAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh, dear, Ann thought, I didn't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have to tell her about Bing, but I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose there's nothing else for it. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is a little more to it," she admitted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow managing to keep her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. "I--I'm in love with a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">works on the paper, and I haven't told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him about myself yet. Of course, I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">always intended to--in fact, I'd already</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to tell him this very afternoon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as he gets back to the office."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She laughed lightly. "So you'll keep my</seg><seg type="columnLine">little secret, won't you, darling? It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be too awful if he learned the truth from</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone else, you can see that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marcella nodded. She took a cigarette</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her bag, and tapped it thoughtfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a lacquered red nail. "Handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">young reporter," she murmured. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be Bing Layton, this man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours, would it, Ann?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, it's Bing," Ann admitted re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luctantly, remembering abruptly what Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told her last night, that there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a time when he might have fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in love with Marcella. That, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant that Marcella must know Bing</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather well, might even -- oh awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought!--be in love with him herself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course, I know it won't make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest difference to Bing that I happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a successful novelist," she added</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly, and wished she felt as sure as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, of course not," Marcella said</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetly. "Well, be sure to let me know</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the new book comes out, Ann. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved Fair Tomorrow." And with a gay</seg><seg type="columnLine">little wave of her hand, she was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sigh of relief, Ann went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work, and it wasn't until half an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">later she suddenly remembered that Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cella had never actually promised to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">her secret. But she shrugged the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatiently away. Even Marcella wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cruel enough to deliberately give her</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to Bing before she had a chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk to him. And surely, he would be here</seg><seg type="columnLine">any moment now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT five o'clock came, and then six,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no Bing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Darn that cocktail party anyway, Ann</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, as she jerked on her hat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried out to the elevator. But she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised, so she supposed she'd have to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">go. Thank heaven, the account of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party couldn't possible make the evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers, and she still could tell Bing to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later, wearing a new blue vel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veteen cocktail suit, and a foolish little</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat fashioned entirely of violets, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Green Room of the Hotel Roth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moor. Impatient for the party to be over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that she could leave and phone Bing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet her some place, she was scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening to the chatter of another lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">novelist who had cornered her. Idly, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes wandered over the crowd, and sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly she gave a strangled gasp. Leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">her companion stranded in the middle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long description of her current heroine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she turned on her heels and began shov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her way through the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was Bing doing here at a literary</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocktail party! Of course, all the papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were represented, but by their society</seg><seg type="columnLine">editors, not reporters. She was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasping for breath, and her hat had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked down over one eye, by the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">she reached the first exit. She had no idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">where that door led, but without a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment's hesitation, she turned the knob.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She simply had to get away before Bing</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw her!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened on a small writing</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and she paused for a moment to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch her breath before trying to find her</seg><seg type="columnLine">way out. And then, to her dismay, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door flung open and slammed shut all</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one motion, and there was Bing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back against it. His blue eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically shooting sparks, and, to Ann,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed that his crisp red hair flamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter than usual with his anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What's the hurry, Miss Lucinda</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lowry?" he asked, with a tight-lipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. "You wouldn't want to leave be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore I had a chance to say thanks for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ride, would you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bing, please--" Ann's voice broke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you needn't feel so badly about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it! After all, it was quite a unique experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence for me. I don't believe I've ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">before played the part of a guinea pig. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose I really should feel rather flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, being chosen as the hero of Lucinda</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lowry's next best seller. Handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">young reporter, I believe was the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marcella says you described me." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed mirthlessly. "Pleitse dbri't forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that I have thick, curly eyelashes, and--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he paused and let his eyes rest insolently</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her lips for a moment, "and that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">kisses pack a special brand of dynamite</seg><seg type="columnLine">that leaves even a cold-blooded lady nov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elist a trifle breathless."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fury swept Ann from head to foot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She didn't know whether that fury was</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed against Marcella for twisting her</seg><seg type="columnLine">report of the conversation so cruelly, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Bing for believing Marcella with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out giving her a chance to explain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She jerked her chin up defiantly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little violet hat slipped down com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely over one eye. She put her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her hips and glared at Bing from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other eye. "I shall devote an entire para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph to your entrancing eyelashes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly two to the quality of your kisses,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she told him, "but it will undoubtedly take</seg><seg type="columnLine">me several pages to do justice to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubborn chin of yours, and to make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite clear that you haven't the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of humor!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Humor!" Bing snapped. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen to find this even remotely amus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ann wilted. With a tired gesture, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed the little hat to the back of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. "No," she said simply, "as it hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens, I don't. Bing, please, listen--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Bing was no longer there to lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten ; he had jerked the door open, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slammed it good and hard behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he went out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A NN never knew how she managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live through those next weeks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only one idea consumed her--to see Bing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make him understand that she really</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved him, that Marcella had deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted her words to give him the impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion she had been using him only as story</seg><seg type="columnLine">material. Over and over she called the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office and his apartment, only to be told</seg><seg type="columnLine">each time that "Mr. Layton is not in just</seg><seg type="columnLine">now." Finally, with no pride left, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that she would go to the Clarion</seg><seg type="columnLine">office and force Bing to talk to her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know just how she was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage it, but manage it she would. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">face to face with him, she would talk so</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast that he wouldn't have a chance to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away before she had had her say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She dressed carefully for that inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">view, feeling that it wras important to look</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her prettiest. No use now keeping up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretense that she had practically no</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes. She put on a soft, gold wool</seg><seg type="columnLine">frock that accented the yellow flecks in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her brown eyes, and a matching gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">wool turban with a six inch swirl on top.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Over the yellow dress she slung a leopard</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat. There! She nodded admiringly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her reflection. Even Marcella, with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a million dollars her grandmother</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left her, couldn't look any smarter!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the way down town in the taxi,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she kept wishing she hadn't thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marcella today. Ever since that horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene with Bing, she had been trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget what he had told her the night he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked her to marry him--that once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have fallen in love with Marcella.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Desperately, she wanted to believe it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only injured pride that was keeping Bing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her, that Marcella herself had noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to do with it. Of course, there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been that picture in last night's paper, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gay party at the Glass Slipper; the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Marcella's right, even though his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was partly turned, had certainly looked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little like Bing. And a day or two before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been an item in one of the gos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sip columns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Maybe gentlemen prefer blondes, but we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> know a certain luscious blonde who definite-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ly prefers redheads these days!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You're being perfectly silly, Ann told</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself firmly, as she walked briskly</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the lobby of the office building and</seg><seg type="columnLine">punched the elevator button. New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">is full of blondes and redheads!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a few minutes later, as she stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the elevator to the corridor of ..he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifth floor, she knew with a sick certainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">that that item had referred to Bing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marcella. For there they were, Marcella</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging with unmistakable possessiveness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Bing's arm, and Bing smiling down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ann!" Marcella squealed delightedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm so glad we bumped into you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's no one I'd rather be the first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear our news. Bing and I are engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">--we're just come from telling Dad!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll bet there's no one you'd rather tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">than me, Ann thought bitterly, while from</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere she conjured up a bright smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How perfectly lovely," she murmured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and couldn't resist adding, "Now I won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">LOVELY LITTLE LIAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have to bother to think up an ending for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my book.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed and pouted up at Bing. "Darling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I completely forgot that!

"Some flyers were in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">canteen today--they looked like babies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply like infants!" And that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong thing to say, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rusty said, "Yes, they like 'em young,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his face was too completely expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionless to be real.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE remembered a new joke that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going the rounds and as she told it</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rusty smiled and the far-away look went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the maid came in and said there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a Miss Miller to see Mr. Heath.

She heard the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cern in Rusty's voice when he said, "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">did exactly right, Florence. Now you go</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight home and get a good night's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep." She noticed that Rusty put his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm around the other girl's shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he took her to the door.

His kiss was long and deep and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhurried, as if he wanted to drain every</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop of sweetness, as if this were not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first kiss, but the last. When that kiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finished, Christy felt as if the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world were holding its breath with won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der because something she had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed about had come true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall always remember tonight,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rusty said softly.

"What are you trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me, Rusty--that I'm spoiled?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not just spoiled, because spoiled peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple are arrogant. You're not even arro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gant, Chris--there's not that much to you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're sweet. But a man needs more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than sweetness. He needs understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The memory of his kiss still burned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mouth. It couldn't have been a good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bye kiss, it was too throbbingly alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chris tilted her head way back and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at Rusty, her eyes shining, her red</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips softly, eagerly parted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Rusty, let's stop arguing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said sharply, "Don't try that, Chris</seg><seg type="columnLine">--it won't work," and she felt the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly hot in her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's what I meant," Rusty's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped now. "You've been brought up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get your own way by being charming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've been brought up to be beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">and useless and you want to go on being</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the way you are. You don't want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change, and I doubt if you could change,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if you wanted to. It's not your fault,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I suppose--it's just the way you are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had started out like an indictment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the anger suddenly left his voice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sounded just tired--terribly tired and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildered. He straightened his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders suddenly, as if throwing off a bur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">den. "Find yourself another playmate, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear, somebody who still has a taste for</seg><seg type="columnLine">milk and honey and low lights and soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">music."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside Christy felt a strange fury, full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heartbreak. "Why did you kiss me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled, then as if she were a slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly foolish child. But there was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter with his smile because it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not reach his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were so obviously waiting to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">kissed. Shall I tell you a secret ? I kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">you with my fingers crossed. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very heady kiss. That's why once was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. I know where to stop and when.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So, good-bye, Christy, my dear--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks for the memory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE front door closed softly and defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitely, and Christy felt her heart slide</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into a bottomless pit. The stars no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer shone and the earth stood still.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rusty was gone. She was idle and use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less and he didn't have time for her. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had kissed her as if he meant it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She wondered suddenly how he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have felt about her if she were no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless. What if she worked, like Flo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rence Miller? What if she proved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rusty that she could hold down a job?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was waiting up for her father when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came in. "Dad, could you pet me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">job?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down heavily, as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired. "I don't know, Kitten. What kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a job? What can you do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why, I--" For a moment she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost, and a little angry at her father, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he seemed to be failing her. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an inspiration, she remembered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">phrase of Rusty's--the girls on the assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly line. "I want d job on an assembly</seg><seg type="columnLine">line."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face brightened. To her surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tired eyes looked suddenly proud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's very fine of you, Christy, to want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do something toward the war effort."</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the first time in years her father</seg><seg type="columnLine">had called her Christy, usually it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Kitten" or "Baby." "I'll see what I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd like a job in Rusty's plant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Did she imagine the shadow that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cross his face? She must have ima-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gined it, because a moment later he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">THANKS FOR THE MEMORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his usual self, kindly and wanting to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">her what she wanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''In Rusty's plant. I see. Are you in</seg><seg type="columnLine">love with him, Baby?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was completely, devastatingly hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est. "I think I shall die if I can't make</seg><seg type="columnLine">him want me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doesn't he want you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not enough." Her voice was pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully even, but her eyes were pleading for</seg><seg type="columnLine">reassurance, for hope. "He kissed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. He--he seemed to like kissing me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's important, isn't it? But then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went away. If he were in love with me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one kiss wouldn't be enough, would it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed as if he were searching for</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. "When times change, Baby, peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple have to change with them. Old stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ards don't count any more." He stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated. "I'll see what I can do about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the job, Kitten."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got the job for her and Christy went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work on an assembly line. She had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">some vague idea of going to work in trim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted slacks. But she wore a shapeless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue denim coverall and hid her bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair under an atrocity they called a tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ban. She sat in one back-breaking posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion all day, until all her muscles screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pain, and put two parts of a screw</seg><seg type="columnLine">together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she stuck to it. She went home</seg><seg type="columnLine">every night and crawled into bed and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to her that she had hardly closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes before the morning alarm sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed hideously in her ears. But she kept at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, because sometime Rusty was sure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk through the plant and recognize her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She dreamed of seeing his blue eyes light</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with surprise and pride and love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then it happened. He passed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the foreman and Christy's fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting screws together, turned cold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff. Her heart hammered against her ribs</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it seemed to her Rusty must hear its</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating clear above the hum and whirr of</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery. Then he saw her and the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">that blazed up in his blue eyes was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had dreamed about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She got a message just before lunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">period that Mr. Heath would like to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">her in his office when she was through</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. But she didn't wait uhtil after</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. She had a half-hour off for lunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she wasn't hungry, anyway. She went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Rusty's office just as she was, in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">voluminous, ugly coverall. But she snatch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed off her turban and let her hair tumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in a cascade of shimmering gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RUSTY said, humbly, "I couldn't wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">until tonight." He took both her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and gripped them hard. He said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can you ever forgive me for the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said? Can you ever--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He choked up. He just stood looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at her as if he were drinking her in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Triumph surged through her, a high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted happiness that went singing its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through her blood. "I didn't put on</seg><seg type="columnLine">any lipstick," she babbled, "because we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">not allowed to wear it. but then if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't any lipstick on then you can't kiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">it off, can you? I mean, you have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful about things like that in an office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed, a little shakily. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was kissing her, hard, fast, turbulent</seg><seg type="columnLine">kisses, and he hugged her so close she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could feel the hard strength of his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the heavy coverall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why didn't you tell me?" he whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She snuggled up against him. "I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd pass by some day and see me. Were</seg><seg type="columnLine">you surprised ? What did you think when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you saw me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice was muffled in her shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. "I thought, thank God, we are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same kind of people, after all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait till I tell Daddy," Chris said con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentedly. "I don't think he really believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would work, even when he got me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">job." She sighed. "I was getting sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtful myself. I began to think I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to stay there for months before you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever find out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She felt the hard muscles of his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">go tense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute, Chris. I'm not sure I</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand. Do you mean you asked your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father to get you a job here just to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">me notice you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She should have been warned, then, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incredulous note in his voice, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wishing he would kiss her again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mmm. . .. Rusty, what's the matter?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It would have been nice," Rusty said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she couldn't mistake the bitterness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice, "if you had cared about helping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to win the war."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tore herself out of his arms, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she saw that his face had gone quite gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes were barren and defeated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was a fool to think you had changed,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "People don't change, unless they</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Rusty--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a trick to get me to notice you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like putting on a different kind of lip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick or buying a new hat. You weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to having a man not notice you, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Christy?" His voice was searing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So you were afraid you would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay on the job for months! And I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were the same kind of people! Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we don't even speak the same language."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She felt hot anger surging up inside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, tying her throat in knots, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the anger was a fierce, hot pride. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't have to look at her with that siz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zling contempt in his eyes. He didn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let his voice drip scorn when he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her. If he didn't appreciate the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had half killed herself doing manual</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor just to impress him, she certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't going to call it to his attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. What did he expect her to do, go</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on her knees?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her brown eyes were on fire as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept her long, yellow hair back from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, thanks for the brush-off," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE found the foreman and told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was quitting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," he said brusquely. "Pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">up your check tomorrow night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tomorrow night? I'm quitting now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The look in his eyes made her shiver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, no, you're not, Sister. You'll finish</seg><seg type="columnLine">your week out, to give us time to put in</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody else. There's a war on--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't you heard?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How dare you use that tone to me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pardon me, Duchess." He shrugged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, you lasted longer than most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them thought you would, at that. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sucker--I told them I thought you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chris clenched her hands together at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned away, dismissing her. "All</seg><seg type="columnLine">right--that's all.

I wonder how</seg><seg type="columnLine">long'it will take to get rid of these cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">louses?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Changing her clothes in the locker room</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night she ran into Mrs. Roberts. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks she had worked next to the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray-haired woman on the assembly line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this was the first time she really no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why aren't you changing?

But you can't--you look</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired already." Christy stopped short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated. "I'm sorry--maybe you need</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other woman shook her head. "No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't need the money. But we ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out more planes. My son writes me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that our planes are better than the Japs',</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they still have more of them. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, they got a head start on us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't know you had a son," Christy</seg><seg type="columnLine">said gently. "Where is he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The last I heard he was in the Solo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mons," Mrs. Roberts told her. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">good night, Miss Carrington. See you</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See you tomorrow," Christy echoed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But not after tomorrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day a subdued feeling of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement ran through the plant. The pace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of everything seemed heightened. Christy</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down the line and it seemed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">many fingers were flying faster than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's going on?" she asked cu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Mrs. Roberts who answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her faded blue eyes were bright and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin shoulders looked unusually straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and proud. "Haven't you heard? We're</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting the Army-Navy 'E' flag this after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Christy smiled politely. "That's fine."</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it has nothing to do with me, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. This is my last day here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But for no reason at all her own fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to move faster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the workers went to the ceremony</seg><seg type="columnLine">that afternoon. They stood massed to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether while an official from the War</seg><seg type="columnLine">THANKS FOR THE MEMORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Department made a five-minute speech.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christy didn't hear much of it because her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were riveted on a disheveled red</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. She thought: Rusty might at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">have combed his hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eyes on Rusty, heart crying out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rusty, she thought she was not hearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the speech, but little snatches of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeped through. "Every minute lost on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the assembly line prolongs the war one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">more frightful minute . . . Every screw</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this factory is an integral part of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bomber."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rusty's wide shoulders were as straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if they were in uniform.

Christy</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked her hands together to still their</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're all in it together," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep voice of the speaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the platform the band played The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Star-Spangled Banner. Unconsciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christy felt her aching shoulders straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en. There was a lump in her throat that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she couldn't swallow, a lump that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to do with heartache or pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oli, say does that star-spangled banner yet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     wave . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pride could bring a lump in your throat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The band stopped and the assembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers turned and filed out of the assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that all?" asked Christy, startled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Isn't there going to be a celebration, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">something?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the men standing near grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at her, a comradely grin. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, Sister--we've got to get back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT THE end of the shift she changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her clothes in the locker room. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">put on lipstick with a lavish hand. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped into her beaver coat and set her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny beaver hat carelessly on her yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.

She could at least say</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-bye to him. She could be gay and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright about it.

She went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to luncheons and cocktail parties and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dances.

With her</seg><seg type="columnLine">long shining hair, just barely curled under</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the ends, it made her look like a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl trying to be sophisticated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Don thought she looked beautiful.

You can't go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the rest of your life carrying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very bright and, burning torch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coming upon Rusty suddenly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance floor at the club made her stop stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">still and catch her breath sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, hello, Rusty.

I thought you were much too</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim and earnest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was proud of the way her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't stand there and let her tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it--I couldn't congratulate her, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet. I have to have a little time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She knew now that she had been hop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing against hope, right up to that last</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreadful moment when Florence had said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We're celebrating."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She struck out blindly, wanting to hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rusty in some way, because she was hurt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing so terribly herself. "Well, what's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject of tonight's lecture going to be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He winced.

You snatched back your dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carded pride and wrapped it around you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like a cloak. "It makes a very funny story</seg><seg type="columnLine">--little Chris getting her come-uppance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You should have heard the gang roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see." She could almost feel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparks shooting from his storm-blue eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shall I take you back to the gang now?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't want to deprive them of a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your funny stories."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he left her with the girl, she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, good-bye, Rusty, darling. Give my</seg><seg type="columnLine">love to the little screws."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a cloak of pride could not warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Nothing could warm you when your</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart was like a lump of ice in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everybody gathered around to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of her. Her friends were so glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see her back in circulation again. "Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">us about it, Chris. Was it fun?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was wonderful," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had practiced how she would tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. "I wore a size 40 coverall and I--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would make such a funny story that</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody would roar with laughter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, "Chris, you're priceless.

Don knew how to push an ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage when he saw it. Christ}' wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long black skirt and a snug yellow sweater</seg><seg type="columnLine">that matched her hair. Don Parsons kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at her as if he could eat her up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until everybody began to laugh and tease</seg><seg type="columnLine">them about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why shouldn't I look at her?" Don.</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, unabashed. "She's like something</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of this world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You're like a drearn-girl, Christy--love-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly and quite unreal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Christy was trembling. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired of this place. Let's do something</seg><seg type="columnLine">different. Let's go to a newsreel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The others let up a howl of protest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Don said fatuously, "I'll take you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a newsreel, Christy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He held her hand in the movie. "Chris,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've got a callous. On those lovely, soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, I've got callouses. You can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have bombers without callouses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aloud she said lightly, "Callouses are</seg><seg type="columnLine">THANKS FOR THE MEMORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. You should have seen them when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were blisters!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the pictures showed a flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">American four-motored bombers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don," she said suddenly, "maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of my screws are in those bombers.''</seg><seg type="columnLine">He laughed. "Christy, you're cute."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's silly, Christy thought. He just</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't know what it's all about. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right to play around with in peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, but he doesn't know there's a war</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then something flashed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen that caught her attention--the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentation of the Army-Navy 'E' Award</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Rusty's plant. They didn't show much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ceremony, just a brief glimpse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speakers' platform, a briefer glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the massed workers. Then the band</seg><seg type="columnLine">played The Star-Spangled Banner and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Christy stood so still she seemed hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to breathe. Her throat was tight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're all in it together . . "My son</seg><seg type="columnLine">says we haven't enough planes." "Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">is your son, Mrs. Roberts?" "The last I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard he ivas in the Solomons." . . . Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough planes . . . "Sorry to lose you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carrington. You were a good worker . . ."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh, say does that Star Spangled Banner</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet wave. . . . "We're all in it togeth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er .."It would have been nice, Christy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you had ti'anted to help win the war. .."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don," Christy said, "let's go home, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to get up early in the morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next morning she went out to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bomber plant and asked the foreman</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she could have her job back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said briefly, "Sorry, Carrington. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to have people we can depend on."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right," Christy said humbly. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't blame you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took a long time for her to find a job</seg><seg type="columnLine">in another plant. It was hard, walking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold and applying for a job, different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">having her father make all the arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments beforehand. And she was afraid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give her last place as reference, but more</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashamed not to. Maybe the foreman</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't recommend her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day she was finally hired she went</seg><seg type="columnLine">home with her brown eyes shining like</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had never seen such pride in any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body's face as her father's when she told</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He cleared his throat several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he spoke. "So you've grown up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you. Kitten?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said, "I'm going to take a course</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night in reading blueprints. The fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man says they can't get enough women</seg><seg type="columnLine">who can read blueprints."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was rather an oblique reply to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">question, but her father seemed satisfied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The assembly lines at the new plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't work as fast as those at Rusty's. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried Christy. It wasn't anything you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could put your finger on, but there just</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't the same urgency about getting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work out. The harassed foremen worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prodded. Once Christy heard Brodie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big foreman of her own shift, swear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing under his breath that you couldn't ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect to get any work out of women, any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Christy hardly knew when she began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk. Maybe it started in the locker</seg><seg type="columnLine">room or at lunch period. But somehow or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, a little shyly at first, she began tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about Mrs. Roberts. Pretty soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody on the line knew about Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roberts, who was middle-aged and tired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but who worked overtime because her son</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the Solomons. Then Christy be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan telling about the Army-Navy 'E' flag.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She said casually, "We ought to get it</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the weeks went by she learned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">names of all the girls in her department.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She knew Violet, whose feet hurt, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Katherine, whose boy-friend was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marines, and Penny, who had a Phi Beta</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kappa key from Wellesley. After a while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter where she went in the plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody was apt to say, "Hi, Chris. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved up seven per cent this week. May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be we will get that flag."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day Brodie passed her and said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Keep going, Sister. You've got what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes. "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chris felt as if she had been knighted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She tried not to think of Rusty. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times she would go for almost five min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes at a time without thinking of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. Then she would tell herself, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wry smile, "Keep going, Sister. At this</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate you'll get over him by the time you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sometimes she would pass a workman</seg><seg type="columnLine">with red hair or a foreman who carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wide shoulders with a slight swagger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">100</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and her knees would turn to water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ache of loneliness inside her would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost more than she could stand. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would go and tell one of the new girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the "E" flag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, miraculously, the news came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The company was to receive the Army-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Navy Award. Christy thought she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never in her life been so proud as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on that Friday afternoon at four</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was way back in the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd and she couldn't see very much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform, but she heard the president</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the company say that today they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">as honored guest the production engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bomber plant for whom they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sub-contractors--Mr. Russell Iieath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Christy caught her breath wildly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost track of what followed. When she</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally fought back to where she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe again the principal speaker was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already nearly finished. But she heard him</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that in the last three months produc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion had gone up twenty-seven per cent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she almost burst with pride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he said, "We thought it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a good idea to have one of the workers</seg><seg type="columnLine">come up here today to receive the flag.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So we asked the foremen to designate</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one to represent the men. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we got a little bit of a surprise. It seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the unanimous choice was a girl. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we heard from those twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-boiled foremen makes us proud to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept their recommendation. Will Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christine Carrington please come up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no," Chris whispered frantically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned to flee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Brodie, big, gruff Brodie, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">took her arm and led her through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinning, applauding crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Christy accepted the flag with shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. She managed a frightened little</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-smile for the smiling officials. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened her mouth and not a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged. Finally she managed a squeaky</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thank you." But it seemed to be enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crowd roared their approval and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">band played The Star Spangled Banner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the officials on the platform gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered round to shake hands with Christy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She thought, "Now it's coming. If I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">get through the next five minutes I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said, "How do you do, Mr. Col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lins ... How do you do, Colonel For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest . . . How do you do, Mr. Heath?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Chris," Rusty said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Don't look at him, Christy, and maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">you zvon't give yourself away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The president of the company was pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting her shoulder paternally. "Mr. Heath</seg><seg type="columnLine">tells me you two are old friends. Sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose you run along with him now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">renew old acquaintance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't," Christy said. "I've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get back to work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 can't. I've stood enough for one day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He zvants to apologise, so he'll feel better</seg><seg type="columnLine">and can go back to Florence with me off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his conscience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense," laughed the president.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll tell Brodie you had special dispen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation. Take her down to my office, Heath</seg><seg type="columnLine">--you know the way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND then she was walking down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall with Rusty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went into the big private office</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Chris sat down, not saying anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rusty didn't seem to know how to begin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either. The silence became thick and em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassing. Finally, for something to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she took off her turban and ran her fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers through her hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she heard Rusty's quick, indrawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've cut your hair," he said stupid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. His voice shook a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It got in my way," Chris said briefly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she flung back her head and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight at him. She was thinner than</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had last seen her, prouder. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were smudges of pallor under her cheek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones. Her wide-set dusky eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerously bright, her voice dangerously</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft.

"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't mean that, at all! But I can't talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you unless you calm down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Calm down!" he exploded. "When</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've ruined my life! All right. You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">not going to talk to me. You're going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk to Sylvia. I'll be back here at five</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock and pick you up.

This would</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen to her, with Ella away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Would he sue? Could he sue? Could</seg><seg type="columnLine">he swamp Troubles, Inc. in a lot of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorable publicity and wreck Ella's be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved business?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that was sheer nonsense.

Sylvia was the doll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby type. Gerry's smoky gray eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">level and candid. Her coral lips had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">humorous quirk at the corners. And her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair was just light brown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No, she decided with a sigh, a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't look at her with Sylvia around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE began to feel very jittery as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of the clock moved toward five.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He won't come, she kept assuring herself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And she felt just as scared that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't come as that he would.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the door was thrust open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there he was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm here!" he announced, scowling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So you didn't try to run away?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not a fugitive from justice," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said haughtily. "Lieutenant--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cowell.

They took a booth at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of the room and Bruce ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">champagne cocktails. She had never had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a champagne cocktail. Jimmy always</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought beer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">106</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEW LOVE MAGAZINE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lifted his glass. "Well, here's to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your success--in persuading Sylvia in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry looked at him. "You love her</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much, don't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One look at Sylvia and any man's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">goner," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry felt irritated to think that even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, sure man like Bruce Cowell would</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall for that baby-face. Men were saps</seg><seg type="columnLine">about women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sylvia's like a soft purry kitten," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "When she curls up in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The picture of Sylvia in his arms made</seg><seg type="columnLine">her furious. She wanted to throw some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing at him. It was such an unreason-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able emotion that she wondered what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter with her. And there was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else that bothered her, too. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might be ordered into foreign service.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That might mean Africa, Australia, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">someplace far away. Someplace where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be in constant danger!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How come," he said suddenly, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you got this job, messing.into other peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple's lives?

I'd like to see anyone tell me what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't suppose anybody could tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you anything." she murmured. "But mod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern life can be very confusing, especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">to girls who live alone. Why shouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">they profit by Miss Eaton's wisdom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you think your precious Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eaton has all the answers to happiness?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She has all the answers for good sense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which goes a long way toward happiness."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He smiled with amusement. "I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've got your life all down pat?" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached across the table and caught her</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand, looked down at Jimmy's signet</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. "Is that an engagement ring?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is," she said coolly, "until we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">afford a real one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you're engaged! He must be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">paragon among men," he said mockingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why do you say that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you don't think I'm attractive</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for a girl to want to marry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually, I'm way above average."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly in conceit anyway," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He just grinned at her. "I've got an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea," he said. "Let's go some place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we can dance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY danced while they were waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their dinner. Bruce was a won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful dancer. It seemed to Gerry that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were simply marvelous together. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">just fitted into his arms. She bet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sylvia Mead was too short for him. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was three inches taller than Sylvia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was very polite and agreeable, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect host, but he didn't seem to he</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of her as a woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This annoyed her. She didn't want him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be so detached. She was falling for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glamor of his money, of course. She could</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathize with Sylvia Mead. No wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was in a state of confusion, deciding</seg><seg type="columnLine">between this man and one who didn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as he had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes past eight he glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his watch. They were just finishing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee. "We'd better get going," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she realized he hadn't forgotten Syl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">via for one moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They took a taxi to East Thirty-fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street and Sylvia opened the door, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like Dresden china in a blue taffeta</seg><seg type="columnLine">house coat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Miss Palmer!" she said, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes widening in astonishment when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Gerry. "I didn't know he was bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Palmer feels that she was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasty in her advice," Bruce said. "She</seg><seg type="columnLine">has decided to have another talk with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took Gerry's arm and led her firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dark and handsome young ensign, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very young man, not more than twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, rose out of a chair and glared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bruce.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sylvia's said she was going to marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">me," he began furiously. "Will you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">that through your head, Cowell, and get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of here before I have to throw you</seg><seg type="columnLine">out?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Goodness, Gerry thought, another</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man with a violent temper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sylvia said, "Now, Dick, darling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">please." She gave a deep sigh and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Gerry. "We could be alone in the bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry followed her into the bedroom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering if it was safe to leave those</seg><seg type="columnLine">two young men together. She couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of anything to say to Sylvia. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly felt very foolish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TROUBLES.

"When you told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me yesterday that I was really in love</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Dick I was so relieved. I thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't really mind being poor at all--</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the war. We'd be so happy because</seg><seg type="columnLine">we loved each other. Then when I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bruce he was so violent about it. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">positively thrilling. I can't bear to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">either of them up. And both of them might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be ordered into foreign service any day."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry said, "I think we'd better wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">until Miss Eaton comes back. This just</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be one of those cases where she'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">say not to marry either of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" cried Sylvia, looking startled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mean she might tell me not to marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," Gerry said.

Gerry knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Ella's answer would be. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it with an awful cold certainty. Syl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">via found Bruce Cowell thrilling. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in love with him. Ella would tell her to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">marry him. Gerry herself could have told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sylvia right that moment. But somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">she couldn't get the words out. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't tell Sylvia to marry Bruce. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of their being married--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She pulled herself up sharply. She re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated, "That's the best thing to do---wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Miss Eaton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sylvia opened the door to the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.

"You're going to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">me an answer yes or no tomorrow, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll never see me again!"

"You got away aw-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fully quick," he said. "The least I can do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is take you home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She said, "You stay with Sylvia."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Sylvia's all wrought-up.

He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turned her face so that she had to look into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his eyes. "Will you please tell me is the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thrill you got from that kiss because of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my bank account--or because I am a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She pushed away from him hard.
