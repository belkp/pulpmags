He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a man for progress, was McNab.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other old-timers had shrugged their</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and turned up their noses back</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the Arachne was first lowered into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her slip preparatory to her maiden voy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. Josh had consoled himself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought that it had always been thus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grizzled oldsters had always said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">old and tried tilings were the best--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing new would last. Their attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">suited McNab. who followed his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">star, never overlooking a chance to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease his pay and position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So. five years before, he'd signed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Chief Engineer of the Arachne. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had never had a doubt until this mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment--though even in his doubt he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the answer. He'd told the skipper that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rotor shaft was beginning to crack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the skipper, to be sure, had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the report along to grasping old fuss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">budget Martin Caperton, who owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Arachne, first of a fleet that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown to two hundred in five years--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">money-makers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a slightly ironical twist in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact, now, that the Arachne, first of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spider fleet, was the oldest of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet, and that some of the oldsters who'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at McNab were now members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of crews of the modern streamline jobs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inclined to look down their noses'</seg><seg type="columnLine">at McNab because he preferred to stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the safe, sane, though rather lumber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Arachne. She was due now to speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">along her regular force-lane to Mars in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of minutes, yet Josh had heard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of a lay-over for repairs. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was quite in line with Caperton poli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cies, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An' there be scuts that say the Scotch</seg><seg type="columnLine">are teet!" he muttered. His Scotch dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lect was broad enough to cut with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife when he was aroused, or talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If repairs were to be made in the slip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caperton had to pay union wages plus</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and a half for overtime. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were made en route--sailors had to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and they received no extra pay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, it was "for the safety of the ship",</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plain duty. Moreover they had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it if they got home again. "An' weel t</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon Caperton kens it!" muttered JoshJ4'"</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Personally, McNab didn't care much''</seg><seg type="columnLine">one way or the other. The Arachne was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much his home as his tiny apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, where he lived frugally and alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saved his money against a rainy day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But he knew what "gravity fever" did</seg><seg type="columnLine">to human beings who might, just possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly, have to spend more time together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooped up on the Arachne, than they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had bargained for--and without weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the main-shaft went. But they, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sailors and marines--the Caperton</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet was government subsidized, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, and semi-military in character--</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to stand by because they wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to do anything else. It was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">being at sea. Passengers didn't jump</seg><seg type="columnLine">overboard and start swimming for shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">just because their ship had to heave-to</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few hours in mid-ocean and make , *</seg><seg type="columnLine">repairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But on the Arachne it could he nasty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Josh, however, had done his duty with</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his usual exactness. The rest was up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Skipper Lee Parsons and Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caperton--the latter a pot-bellied old</seg><seg type="columnLine">owl in shell-rim spectacles. If no stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">order came through, the Arachne would</seg><seg type="columnLine">get under weigh on schedule.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ye're the purrtiest thing," said Josh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking the Arachne over from the rim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the slip, his gray eyes glistening with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride. "Purtier than the bonniest las-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sie that ever coom oot o' Scutland, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">one! If only I had the money to own</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sighed, for he knew that a Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engineer's pay, even when he saved it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, would never get him to first base in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a purchase. He ran a gnarled, oil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimed finger across a section of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magnesium-beryl hull plates of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arachne. To Josh it was like touching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skin of one's best beloved--though</seg><seg type="columnLine">Josh had almost forgotten just what that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like. There had been a wife once</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Mary--but that had been long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ago. After she died--Josh had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been twenty-five then--he'd never looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at another woman as a man might,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though any woman named Mary had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of claim on his heartstrings. Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nab was now fifty. He got his enjoy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment from watching the stars in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of sweethearts and newlyweds who</seg><seg type="columnLine">took trips, honeymoon and vacation, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Arachne. It was almost like being</seg><seg type="columnLine">young and having your own wife again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">HE WENT INTO the hull through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a door that opened at his touch and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him without sound. Lord, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she worked pretty. Never a thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasp on the nerves of a touchy old buz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zard like Josh McNab--who couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand the screech of unoiled hinges, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of metal against metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Arachne was perfect--except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the infinitesimal crack in the rotor shaft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Might take a little time for its effect to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be noticed, for it was of thirty-inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">chrome-moly steel, and might even stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">up until the Arachne eased back into her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slip on the return voyage. But sooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">or later it would go. Caperton knew it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had, doubtless, already figured out</seg><seg type="columnLine">just how to save that time and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">for overtime. Well, that's how a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Caperton got rich, he supposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A leatherneck sentry saluted respect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. Josh paused and asked him how</seg><seg type="columnLine">his kids were, and the young chap's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted like a harvest moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine, sir, just fine. And by the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">we get back, if we keep to schedule,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there'll be another one. We're expect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and praying for a girl, this time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That gave Josh a sort of pang, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing he regretted out of a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">active life was that he had no children.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The one that had taken his wife had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone away with her, and it was a sad</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to remember. But the Arachne</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow toek the place of both--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arachne and her passengers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crew was already at stations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The marines were at their sentry posts</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the outward voyage. Josh wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure he liked marines. They were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little on the bossy side, and they un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buttoned the collars of their tunics when</seg><seg type="columnLine">their officers weren't around. Still, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you had to have order, and maybe had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep it by force, they did all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the sailors, now, they were the lads.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You always knew right where you stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNab, informed that Skipper Par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons hadn't come aboard yet, made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">round of inspection. Not that he needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to--not even in the Tunnel, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own special stamping ground, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">his black gang enjoyed a tradition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">precision in their work. But there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction beyond words to express in</seg><seg type="columnLine">going over the whole ship anyhow--</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing, feeling, almost tasting, the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights of the Arachne. It was almost a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ritual with him, to start from his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters, in the top section of the Tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel, just under the top main thrust bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, beyond which was the wart on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull that was the control bridge. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">"HELL SHIP"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a grrand tiling to stand in his own door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smell, and listen, before beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ritualistic descent through the heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his kingdom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just outside McNab's quarters the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge magneso-beryl girders were a trac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery of complex web-work, distributing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thrust of the monster main shaft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That web-work talked to Josh McNab</seg><seg type="columnLine">in confidential whispers as it strained to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its work--telling him how things were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going, and whether he was correctly</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing his job. The whispers were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">real to Josh that sometimes he caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself saying: "So, is that richt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noo ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got his bearings now from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew's quarters, in the topmost rounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hull, where the rooms were many</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped, and intersected by the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust-spreading girders. Those girders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering, lulled his own tired men to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. The whole crew seemed, to Josh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like spiders in the girder web.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE TUNNEL ran the length, aloft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and below, of the Arachne--almost the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full two hundred and seventy-five feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her. Just to inspect it made Josh</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that he was the heart of the sturdy</seg><seg type="columnLine">old spaceship. Seldom indeed did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">use the swift elevators that paralleled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shaft, for what could you see from</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevators? Nothing at all! But the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular staircase leading down--that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something different. It circled the Tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel, and kept you so close to the smell</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sound of the main-line helix that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you felt--if you were Josh McNab--</seg><seg type="columnLine">like you were a surgeon examining a</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient with painstaking care. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was always the bite of oil in the nostrils,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfume to the soul of a Scotch engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neer. And then there were the clank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings of the perfectly fitting parts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helix and its operating sister--of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship was a "she"--the motor's rotor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound on the same shaft because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrifugal stresses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNab started below. The sound of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his footfalls on the steps would let his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew know he was enroute--not that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">mattered especially, as he wasn't the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind to sneak up on honest, hard-work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing men--for it went winging down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tunnel as though he had shouted he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming. He took a white glove</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his pocket, thrust his hand into it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was spotless. Grinning, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of the result, he closed the gloved</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on the rail of the staircase, pol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished like a mirror, and clung as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked down. After ten steps or so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, looked at the glove, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest swelled a little. The glove was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still spotless. His lads kept things ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape, sure enough. But, just to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure they hadn't cleaned the rail for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit for the first ten feet or so, he slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand along the rail for ten feet more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he took off the glove, still stain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, put it into his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A complete picture of the ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his head, but even so, every trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a voyage of discovery, every step</seg><seg type="columnLine">through her a delight. A great sphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was, two hundred and fifty feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter amidships, at the belt. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked best to think of her when the heli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">copter tugs were warping her in to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing--swallows about a mighty hawk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten thousand tons of dependable space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. Though he couldn't see through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls of the Tunnel as he descended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew where he was every second of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the descent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Level under level, below the crew's</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters, the passengers' quarters, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">classes--based, as always, on price paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">for tickets and service furnished--to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first-class quarters, which gave directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto the mid-section, by gentle stairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which housed the belt promenade--with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its transparent plastic windows--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main lounge, bar, dining saloon and so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNab liked to visit the mid-section</seg><seg type="columnLine">to watch passengers come aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Remembering that now, as he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the midships level, he hurried a bit, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">get back in time, though he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">slighted an inspection. In the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">third of the ships were the cargo levels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where stowing must be such that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of gravity was below the gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional line helix, so the ship would hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight. Down there, too, were the ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumulators--storing electric power for</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergencies--and the atom converters</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose endless humming was music in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ears of McNab, as much a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as the little tufts of gray hair that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust forth from those same ears. Oxy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gen and water tanks were down there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, the air apparatus, all the auxiliary</seg><seg type="columnLine">functions, the D. C. motor--forty thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand horse power!--series wound, capa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble of revving up to 35,000.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He checked the accumulators and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom converters, and kissed his finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tips to them, looked around guiltily to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make sure nobody had caught him at it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I could e'en kiss 'em i' fact," he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, remembering again, he hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">back up the stairs, again disdaining the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevators, trying to forget how the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">or gravitational line helix--which</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled like a snake around the rotor</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft--almost always got him down. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked miracles, and he wasn't too sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of himself in the presence of miracles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something almost weird and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unearthly about the helix.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> HE PAUSED before reaching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulkhead that gave on the belt prome-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nade, and looked at his watch.

Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in knickers, bareheaded, maybe a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckless ones with suspicious bulges to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hip pockets where their flasks</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested.

Some would stick to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge tables from the starting time until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they arrived at journey's end.

His men were up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down the stairs, suddenly, like fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men on their pole when an alarm came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in.

A query over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inter-level address system had informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that Parsons was in the lounge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking with an admiring bunch of fe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">males.

He felt his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushing painfully as the women looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at him, some with smiles of amuse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be giggles, and he would get con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused, and Parsons would think it funny.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsons was a good skipper, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bull-headed and not always bright--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he did have a ready tongue when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came to gab with the ladies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parsons sounded very brave and mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culine.

Only Jack Islip and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that female of his stayed apart from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mary recognized McNab's distaste for</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussion in the presence of so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">women. "The rotor?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Josh McNab nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''He insists it should be stopped," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsons.

He wished Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't spoken. It made him feel like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool, though he loved her anew for stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up to Parsons. Not many people</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared do that, even women, when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting out to be authoritative. He rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, with half the passengers trailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, close on the heels of McNab and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary, and stopped at the bulkhead where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept a chart, properly marked every</seg><seg type="columnLine">six hours for the benefit of the passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers. He touched the chart with a blunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">forefinger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're about halfway, McNab," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, almost as though he were teaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alphabet to an incorrible kindergar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten child. "Right where the lines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">force are most widely separated. If we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop now, we drift out of them entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">--into the doldrums, speeding on for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heaven knows where. I don't care to</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned back to McNab. "Drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, McNab," he said grimly. "We can</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat the break to our port."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, sir, but-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Orders, McNab. I said to drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">her!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNAB touched his forelock.

The thing left to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stick to the Tunnel for the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of two more days, and sort of pray</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rotor to safety. Prayers were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, McNab knew, but spanners, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right kind of heat were also good for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a break in the rotor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parsons was blundering again.

It was one thing to kill peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple, or take chances with their lives, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite another to tell them what to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect. Parsons spoke over the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">level address system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ladies and gentlemen," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"there is no real danger, of course.

Her hand gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNab's arm tightly. He patted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand with his own. It was grand for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's strength to have someone who</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood by through all sorts of weather.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsons was going on, managing now</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sound pompous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just remember the tradition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caperton lines--five years on schedule</seg><seg type="columnLine">without loss of life or a ship.

He wasn't the first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize, but it startled him. Maybe he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had expected shouts of encouragement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or belief in his prowess. If so, the sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den silence must have bothered him con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderably, or what happened in the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments would never have hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound was the shuddering of the rotor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the schuffing indecision that had sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNab hurrying to see the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Faces turned toward the doors that</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked the Tunnel.

A marine</seg><seg type="columnLine">sergeant solved that problem by crack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the frenzied man in the mouth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow went down, hitting the deck with</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely too much force. His head</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounced as it struck.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed, then, what transpired every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where else on the Arachne. But he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind that, either, knowing that Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Purdy would give him the facts when</seg><seg type="columnLine">both were free again for a session of talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">WHAT HAPPENED in the belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">promenade, and the lounge, and the bar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary Purdy told Josh McNab later, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">strictest confidence, with many peals of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter--only at the time it happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wasn't by any means a laughing mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. First, Mary--while McNab hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over-handed it up the staircase, swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing first over the stairs, then over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abyss of the Tunnel--got her hands on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knob of the door leading into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">promenade. Then, by exerting unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, in new and untried directions</seg><seg type="columnLine">--muscles she'd never used before--she</seg><seg type="columnLine">got her feet on deck, pushed the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, and entered the promenade, clos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the door by a weird reversal of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening process.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, holding onto the knob, she stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked about her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everybody on the promenade looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like people trying to walk under unusu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally clear water. Even the movement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hair resembled a weird "dance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drowned". Jack Tslip and his girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">were trying to hang onto each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl bent her knees and tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling herself into Jack's arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack reached for her and missed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young lady sailed up to the ceiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave her head a resounding crack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It effectually stopped her screaming, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it knocked her out. Jack reached up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to pull her down, and suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded instead in getting himself off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck, and couldn't get back down again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack did the natural thing, then; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swam around, harkening to the pealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mary's laughter--in which none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other passengers joined. In the eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her mind, Mary could see passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their staterooms, rolling out of bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not being able to reach the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and simply floating about and yelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads off. It struck her as very</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny. But to them, it was only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightful sensation of a fall--a fall that</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on and on and must end in a fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful smash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mary almost offered to help Jack pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl down and place her on a divan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but decided against it. Let the little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Save several cents a pack! Try Avalon Cigarettes! Cellophane vorap.

She was surer than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this was the proper caper when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack, turned clear around at last, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her with such a glad light in his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her heart turned clear over and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">started hammering as though it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffocate her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she stopped laughing, for the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the passengers were in a state. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them understood, vaguely, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't. Some of them thought they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at sea, and that the belt promenade had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been flooded--and were both relieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">and terrified to find that they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe in the strange element in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they swam-walked-floated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But faces were white as death. Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">is born fearing only two things--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of these is falling. Nobody said</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything, probably because nobody be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved it possible for them to talk. Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered what would happen if the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petually partially inebriated tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink from bottles, and the liquor</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't run out. It would be disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing, no doubt about that, and cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly conducive to the very latest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">delirium tremens. She was glad beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">words that she had asked all sorts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions of McNab and been patiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered. Knowing what it was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about she could feel the weirdness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything without being too frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the "falling" sensation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thing was certain: McNab had</seg><seg type="columnLine">effectually stopped the marines and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers from fighting! It would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been worse than trying to fight on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean floor at three fathoms!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jack!" Mary called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Coming, honey," he said. "If some</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind spatial spirit will tell me how to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you--and then will arrange for you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forgive me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let it pass, Jack," she retorted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Seeing that woman hanging by nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the ceiling pleases me more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can say. It practically balances every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> IT DIDN'T help the nerves of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers any, or even the marines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Parsons came, hand under hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the rail of the stairs from the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">class passenger level, looking very fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish, and with his face beet-red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blast McNab!" he roared. "If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever return to normalcy, and get my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on that damn Scotchman! I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">break every bone in his head!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mary laughed, and Parsons looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and his face slowly cleared, even as,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the end of the rail, he went through</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the queer contortions he deemed nec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">essary to get his body into a position</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might be called approximately nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal. Magnetic shoes were necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to the engineers, and they alone had</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. This done, he gave a brief ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress to such passengers as were within</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm taking every precaution," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked, "for the safety of the Arachne.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My Chief Engineer made a stupid blun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der in stopping the motor to repair a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack in the rotor.

It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a queer condition, but quite harmless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you don't try any broad jumps. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is any danger at all, between now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the time when the motor is repaired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we are under weigh for Mars once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, it's because we've slipped our</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-lane, are out of control, and head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into unknown space.

It took some min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes, but he got it finally, and a sheepish</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin started to spread on his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're right, Mary," he said frankly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've been stubborn and opinionated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"HELL SHIP"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll admit it now, freely, to everybody,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to McNab when I get a chance.'''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And he won't be placed under ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''No, damn it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to tell him!" said Mary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgetting herself and kicking around to</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the door, go back into the Tunnel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortunately she was hanging onto the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knob when she jumped, or she might</seg><seg type="columnLine">well have joined Jack Islip's girl on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling. It scared her, and it scared</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack, a fact which she noted with im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense satisfaction when she managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get back to an even keel, more or less.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Josh McNab and his men were busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">repairing the crack in the rotor. Josh</seg><seg type="columnLine">estimated that, with luck, the job would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done in eight hours, if everybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked hard, and didn't lose any tools.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The latter possibility wasn't a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave concern, but if a man dropped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spanner it didn't stay where it was, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated off on its own. That fact was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no help, rather a detriment to the trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleshooters. And the reason for no lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle hilarity. Someone proposed that, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inducement to passengers in the fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, one stop in mid-space should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made on every voyage, to show every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body what it was really like to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">"space-legs." Josh hushed everybody,</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisting that wasted breath mended no</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracked rotors, and the work went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Josh McNab ordered a thermite jacket</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed around the area of the crack in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rotor. A mixture of aluminum pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and iron oxide, it glowed with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific heat when fired--well into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue-white, and the metal of the rotor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fused again with a minimum of lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. This done to Josh's satisfaction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excess metal was ground off with</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor-driven hand-grinders, a detail</seg><seg type="columnLine">that took longer, until the rotor at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot was round again. Then the area</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heat-treated with a portable induc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion furnace strapped around the shaft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a workmanlike job, finished</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in jig time. Now and again McNab</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked an odor. His men worked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a will, pleased with the way things were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going and, frankly, after a while becom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a bit jittery about the matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">weightlessness. They became accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed to looking down into the depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Tunnel without fear, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">man expressed his fear of later conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quences aptly. "I'm afraid, sir, that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating in space may get to be a habit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that when we get back our weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're likely to forget and step right into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shaft, and get ourselves hurt at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Josh, apparently in all seriousness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that the answer to that was sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple. He thereby ordered them, each and</seg><seg type="columnLine">severally, never at any time to go down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tunnel save by the stairs or the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vators, on pain of dire punishment for</seg><seg type="columnLine">disobedience of orders. That, he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided, would take care of the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the job was done, on time al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most to the minute, Josh went head fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most back down the staircase to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor. Slowly he eased it into speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but no weight returned. He had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected none.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">AFTER EIGHT HOURS of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lirium of sorts, the Arachne was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. But whither? She had lost her</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-line, simply gone off her gravita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional "trolley", and had to get back onto</seg><seg type="columnLine">some branch-line or other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parsons explained it to the subdued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-faced passengers. "We're--well</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you've ever flown kites, and sent pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper flying up the string to the kite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you understand our situation. We're a</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper that's cut through and blown away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The space we traverse is filled with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense number of 'kite strings'--lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gravitic force, in fact--stretching like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a web beyond imagination between all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planets, stars, every heavenly body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where we are now, my friends, we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the webs from Earth to Mars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars to Earth, Venus to Jupiter. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we can swing onto gravitational force-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines between Venus and Jupiter, we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow them back to the point at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they cross Earth-Mars lines, and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shift and go on with our work. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the moment, we're in the doldrums.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We've got to accept the situation. Play</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge. Get drunk. Make love. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything, but don't get panicky. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">get by all right, and there is no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">any danger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're lying!" said Mona McKel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar. She was Jack Islip's girl, or had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. Now she had a bruise on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and a bad case of jealous fury.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You know we haven't got a chance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We shouldn't believe the captain, any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNab entered the lounge, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation was going on, in time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear Jack Islip interrupt Mona McKel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar. And Jack said, "Shut up!" -with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice like the crack of a whiplash. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you don't shut up, I'll bat your ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">down!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mary Purdy may not have been ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly a ladv at the moment, for she</seg><seg type="columnLine">clapped her hands, audibly. And a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who didn't matter much otherwise, spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and said: "Listen you," to Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islip, "you can't talk to a lady like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just what," said Islip, "are you going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do about it? I'm responsible for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">silly filly, and if she tries to start an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other panic on the Aracline, a kick in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the teeth will do her good and save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why, you-" The stranger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">launched himself at young Islip. Young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack, his face suddenly exalted, half rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and met the attacker with a right to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">button that stretched him on the deck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islip floated away to the far end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lounge. The stranger danced away</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosely, somewhat after the manner of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped dummy on its way down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McNab, coming in to report to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper that everything was all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran right into this situation. He made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his report, stated that he was now en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">route to his quarters, as previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered, where he would consider him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self under arrest until the Arachne re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to her home slip at New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parsons turned red and roared out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There'll be no malingering on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arachne, Josh!

She whim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered and swam away hastily toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reviving man Jack had knocked out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He held out his arms, very sympatheti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally, to receive her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus was everybody satisfied, includ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Mona, who felt herself lucky to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man at the exact moment of her need.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VI.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "JOSH McNAB," said Skipper Par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons, "you are an incorrigible old coot!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I feel sure that you could have brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Arachne to port without the slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est bit of danger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, sirr," said Josh McNab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two w'ere standing side by side</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the control bridge. They sounded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if there had been any listeners to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter thought, like two people who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a very deep hatred for each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsons' eyes were frosty, but McNab</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it was fake frost, somehow like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kind they made in Hollywood to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save themselves the cost of trips to cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">countries. McNab's eyes were twin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't you say anything but 'aye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sirr,' McNab? You go along with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">all these years, saying as little as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">"HELL SHIP"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, yet you can cause more trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">and discombobulation than all the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crew put together. Now, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory of the whole business is this: you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to help Mary get her man back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And so, you turn my ship into a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cupid's kindergarten, and I'm not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure I like it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Josh McNab didn't answer. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned long ago that Parsons had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick mind, and that almost anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">Josh said might conceivably be used</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him--sometimes in embarrassing</seg><seg type="columnLine">company. And this one he didn't like.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He couldn't quite see himself as a naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cupid with wings and a bow and ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows. The picture didn't somehow fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with his idea of Scotch dignity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Besides, if he talked much, Parsons</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inclined to mimic his brogue. Josh</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't especially mind that ordinarily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsons was terrible at it. So the less</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said the less he'd have to account for</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the final reckoning was in. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">this talk of turning the Arachne into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cupid's kindergarten filled Josh with</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasiness. It came quite too close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew, officially, how he stood with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsons. All right--or he wouldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the control bridge now, waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Arachne to do her gentle "somer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sault" for the lowering away to Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shift from the Jupiter-Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">force-lines to the Earth-Mars lines had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken place with no trouble whatever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, with the motor going great</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns again, and the great density of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jupiter-Venus lines they'd ridden a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while, the eight hours were going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made up. The Arachne would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">warped into her Martian slip right on</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. That was a great saving, for if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she were not, she'd have to stand off</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars until the right city came under her</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Mars revolved. The Arachne-type</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity ships went up or down, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be towed to move sidewise. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lost time, unless made up, could eas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily double itself. However, that would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not happen now. The gods of inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary space were working with Josh</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNab, Mary Purdy, Jack Islip, and.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Skipper Parsons, to say nothing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sturdy old Arachne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have I the captain's permission to</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit the bridge, sir ?" came a calm, clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> SKIPPER and Chief Engineer turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a look. Without waiting for Parsons</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give an affirmative answer, Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into the control room, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a sheepish Jack Islip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is against the rules, Miss Purdy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Parsons, "for passengers to step</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto the control bridge. You will re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">move yourself and your man Friday at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack Islip started back in some alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary snapped at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stay where you are, Jack. The skip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per's bark is far worse than his bite!</seg><seg type="columnLine">With or without permission, Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsons, I'm going to stick with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge through the somersault. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">does it happen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right away, Mary," said Parsons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And I am calling your attention to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather obvious fact--obvious to anybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a man in love, Jack Islip--that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">young woman calmly overrides the au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thority even of an interplanetary Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a Caperton ship--the Arachne, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. She rules the roost with calmness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and complacency. So she will rule, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">insist, in her home--which you will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">deceived into believing, if you're soft and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit screwy, is also your home. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't. Not at all. Mary will boss you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make you like it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall like it," said Jack Islip defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, my friend, you're a gone gos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling. Am I right, Josh McNab?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yon skipper is alway richt!" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">McNab, in a voice which showed plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he actually thought the skipper</seg><seg type="columnLine">never was. Parsons choked and his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">got red, but he forgave Josh because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that he was outnumbered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But 'ee's a bit daft in his richtness, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parsons, having studied his charts a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit, and satisfied that he had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the right spot in space, stepped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his inter-level address microphone. Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nab grinned and winked at Jack and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary as Parsons straightened his uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form and his body, as though, by speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the microphone, he were preen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing himself before the eyes of a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">bevy of admiring females.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is now time to reverse ship and lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">away for Mars. Will you be kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, for a few minutes, to hang onto</seg><seg type="columnLine">something, while I about ship? I'll give</seg><seg type="columnLine">you five minutes to get set, no longer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, before you know it, the worst will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be over, and we'll be settling toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars instead of diving into it head</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Josh McNab had dropped back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tunnel by the time Parsons had finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">his speech. Mary and Jack Islip</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed at what they could find--in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluding each other. Parsons went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his controls, and kept an eye on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch. Mars looked to be above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. But in less time than it took to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell about it, Mars was below the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Arachne was crawfishing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian lines of force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's like shooting an arrow," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsons, "that turns in the air and hits</seg><seg type="columnLine">the target with the feather end. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell the passengers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped to the inter-level micro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone again, barked : "Carry on, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. It won't be long now--thanks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Josh McNab and his black gang!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Which struck McNab as being pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">decent of the skipper, except that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">overdoing the coals to Newcastle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making himself out a fine tolerant figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man. When he had Parsons alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would point out this fact to him. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">though Parsons didn't know already!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ah, a bonnie lass and a fairish red-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">headed lad! They made a fine picture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing there together, waiting for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arachne to make port.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE TURN completed and the rotor</seg><seg type="columnLine">humming smoothly as it eased the liner</seg><seg type="columnLine">"down" to Mars, Josh returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge. "If ye gang to the belt prome-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nade," said Josh McNab, "ya maun see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helycopters coom oot to warrp the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arachne in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parsons grinned at him.

It was the Northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manitoba summer and heat lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy among the old pines of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick wood, and flattened the water of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow creek. Fourteen years old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jason Grant sent his little canoe cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously up the creek, and wondered why</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept looking over his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lake Athapap lay behind him. Ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles away his father was perspiring on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach in the hot sunshine.

Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was not a sound blit the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping from his paddle, and the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own breathing. He didn't like it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He sniffed, lifting his brown face to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft wind that stirred among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. There was some sort of alien</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">smell to the place-- And that stuff</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the trees--was that moss, or some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of greenish slime? He put in to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the creek, and his hand went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a patch of the stuff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped that hand in mid-air.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured, "There's something here I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't get," and dipped to turn. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a whiteness strewn among the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short distance up took his eye. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared. He sent the little canoe shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing forward. Excitement rose in him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those looked like skeletons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Stepping distastefully among the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eased trees, he suddenly recoiled in hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror. They were not skeletons. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were things infinitely more hideous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once they had been something like men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though with alien, abnormally heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">skulls and great, stooped shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now! The boy's stomach turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in revulsion.

Jason took a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance and turned before he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">vomit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flash of sunshine on metal be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the thick trees caught his eye in</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning. He stared. About a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet away were patches of bright steel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen between the obscuring, slime-hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hesitated. Then, lithe as a cat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ran carefully between the high old</seg><seg type="columnLine">pines. Not once did he touch the stained</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark. The silence was thick and hot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jason leaped nimbly over a deadfall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> IT LOOMED above him now. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was vast and smooth and cylindrical and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy had not the faintest idea what</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was. Thick windows were fused into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal sides. Trees had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun to lace branches over it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining bulk was dim in the shadows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jason decided to go around to the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But then he came to a strange, high</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway, perfectly round. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fill the aperture was a perfect disk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half rolled into a slit in the framework.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He decided to look inside and climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up over the rim. Within ten feet was</seg><seg type="columnLine">another round portal. Beyond, he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long corridor, silent and still. Lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in the ceiling burned dimly, steadily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boy wondered how long they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been burning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jason shivered suddenly. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the loolc of the corridor. Turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the door he noticed a little round</seg><seg type="columnLine">light set into the wall. Experimentally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fingered it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And beyond, the outer disk sighed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid shut. A fraction of a second later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner disk closed, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jason bit his lip and fought down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic which suddenly closed like a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand about his heart. He rubbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light again. He twisted it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course; there would be another</seg><seg type="columnLine">light somewhere. He looked around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">JASON COMES HOME</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">31</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping his eyes away from the distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend of the corridor. If anything came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">around that bend- He saw a panel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wall opposite the closed door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within were strange switches. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them looked something like the light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He put his hand over it--and cried out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far away in the depths, machines had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly come to life with oddly human</seg><seg type="columnLine">screams. It brought the hair erect on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy's neck. An instant later the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor seemed to rise up and strike him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a tremendous acceleration made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs like things of rubber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lay for a moment, then struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect. He would have to go down that</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor. He started off, trembling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-eyed--and came to a window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagerly he looked out. The sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees and the squirrels would help him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to quiet-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he saw a blackness without end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vast velvet backdrop for the infinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars which were like a million cold eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching him. Only that he saw, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blinding disk of a sun that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shrink even as he watched. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars and the Sun, and the silver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust glory of the Milky Way, clear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkling beyond belief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jason stared and stared, until his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were blurred with stars. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid to the floor in the first faint of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE BOY flattened against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway and stared into this great room</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the heart of the speeding ship. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were dazzled by a thousand flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lights; his gaze was blurred by try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to follow a hundred spinning things</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once. Here were the machines which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sending the great craft flicking</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the emptiness beyond the Solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">System. And there was not a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">living thing to tend to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a week after he had unwittingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown the ship into space. After the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first terrible shock, Jason had rallied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Room by room, corridor by corridor, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had slipped through the hurtling vessel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">expecting at any instant to be discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered by living replicas of the beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose boneless bodies he had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had found nothing living--noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but a tiny red squirrel which still</seg><seg type="columnLine">eluded him.

The ramifica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the great ship seemed endless;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had lost his w:ay, gone in circles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He judged that it was two days later</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he found the storerooms close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the keel of the ship. He had eaten his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill of the strange synthetic foodstuffs;</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them had made him violently</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick. He had gone on, exploring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper decks, the living quarters-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were a thousand things he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand. He walked in a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petual wonder, bothered by a fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unknown that was not to leave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many months. Even now, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the flashing color and motion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power plant, he kept looking back</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cautiously now, he went into the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, weaved among the towering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">humming bulks until he came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center. Here w:as an enormous thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A vast hemisphere of thick, trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent metal housed gleaming motion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jason pressed against the glassy sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. His father had taught him ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary physics thoroughly, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant nothing to him--yet. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a coruscating point of light, so small it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost invisible. He could not bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look at it. Great, slow-moving arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reddish radiance weaved from it, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">sucking arms, moving with a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression of titanic, chained power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jason moved away. He jumped sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly. Something had stirred in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway.

But he could not speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, because the acceleration still</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his body leaden, the boy moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the engine room.

Nothing to do, day</seg><seg type="columnLine">after day, but eat. For years--then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would die--sleep after a living death</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked here-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to cry, great tears rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">one by one down his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the following day he found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">library'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a small, book-lined room be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the control room. There were ta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles, and a queer machine in one corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">with headsets and an audio speaker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jason took down some of the books.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He opened one, turning the thin metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">pages, looking at the strange script, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alien, oddly frightening diagrams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In one book he found nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes later he was studying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">still-damp prints--yard-long strips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin metal, crossed with thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark lines.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured, "What the devil--is this the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirn system, or not? If that confounded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">selector has picked the wrong sun-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaped away to the inner two planets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few hours later, utterly and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely baffled, he was lancing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the system again, heading for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sixth planet.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment later, as they started forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob could feel his hair try to stand up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whole back of it sagged with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The small car picked up terrific speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they tore over the road faster than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earthman had ever traveled on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. The machine seemed glued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface, and gave a feeling of se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curity. The rubber-man handled it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect ease, and turned to grin at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger several times during the trip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The highway was without defect, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vehicle bad almost unlimited speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slight glow appeared ahead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually changed to the lights of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large settlement. Until they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a few miles, the lights remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the horizon of the small world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then seemed to rise from the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little world was so close to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun that it would receive intense rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dixon was suddenly thankful that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he landed on the darkened side--even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">AST--4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">though it was necessity instead of choice!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His mind jerked back to the surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings as the car entered the city. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthman could feel the whole Vehicle</seg><seg type="columnLine">sway front, then gradually settle back as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came to a stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> None of the buildings were over six</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories high. They stopped before one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the highest. In the bright light the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber-man appeared greenish-yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slightly transparent. Yet upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer examination his skin was opaque.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob hadn't been able to see his coloring</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything was of the same substance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The car, the streets, and the buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">were elastic. Even the largest structures</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulged at the bottom, from the weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doorways sagged, and some of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">slanted to the side. The windows were</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked. On the upper floors they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, but toward the ground they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become short and stubby. The sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the Earthman a dizzy feeling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he closed his eyes before looking a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob reluctantly followed the rubber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man into the building and the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagged beneath their weight. At any</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he expected the whole structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to melt with them beneath it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AS THEY walked up the resilient</seg><seg type="columnLine">ramp, he wondered if the city was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted. It was strange that a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">which could house several thousand peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple would have no sign of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clear material in the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings sagged until it wrinkled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom.

Benches sagged at the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">to nearly touch the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went back down through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building after the man collected a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">belongings, but still there was no sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life. When they reentered the car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob was completely baffled.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were evidently the last people to leave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all power was shut off at their exit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hours passed while the small car tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the road through the darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several times the Earthman dozed off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The material of the conveyance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">springy, and lulled him into peaceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumber.

The women</seg><seg type="columnLine">were decked .with every kind of object.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little bright buttons were stuck in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair, which curled the same as the men's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their dress was colorful, and similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a child's romper suit. The single plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">robes of the men were a direct con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were like rubber dolls, with lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle round faces displaying perpetual good</seg><seg type="columnLine">humor. The only other emotion their</seg><seg type="columnLine">features registered was a pouty ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression. But even that didn't appear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be displeasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he climbed out of the small car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they crowded around. A humming sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from many of the throats while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they grinned at sight of the stranger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some children came running and bounc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down the street with laughter on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces, and he grinned back. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">infectious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rubber-tnan led the way into one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the main buildings. It was in better</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition than the structures of the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted city, but there were some signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sagging. The floors were resilient,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the clear panes in the windows re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained smooth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everyone stopped to grin at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger. They seemed happy to see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">human being, which was a matter for</seg><seg type="columnLine">conjecture to Dixon. He knew they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never had intercourse with the Solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">System. It was a new planet, unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plored by Earthmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After climbing up three stories on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloping ramps, they entered a room with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rubber-man seated on a throne at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far end. He appeared the most con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">genial of any of the creatures and, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthman's approach, grinned until his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth tried to stretch from ear to ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dixon jumped back--the man tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rub his nose against Bob's cheek! Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">regaining his poise, he stuck his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to rub his nose against the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ruler. He couldn't help but think</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much it felt like a rubber ball.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE STRANGER was accepted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an honored guest, and given the best of</seg><seg type="columnLine">food. His living quarters were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building with the ruler, but the inaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">got on his nerves. He couldn't talk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone, and couldn't wander about as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pleased. They took him sightseeing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but wouldn't allow him to go alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It pleased them immensely when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to imitate their vocal sounds, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ruler appointed a man to instruct</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. At first, everything sounded alike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he slowly learned to repeat many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words. They didn't understand his</seg><seg type="columnLine">language, and it never entered his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to voice anything in English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must learn how to make his wishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">RESILIENT PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">S3</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">known before he could explain what</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemicals were required as fuel for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eagle. Even then it would be hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">describe the spot where he had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had mastered many intricacies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of science in a world without hard sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, using electricity for every pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose. Even the road-cars were driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">by magnetism. There was not a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotating part in any of the machinery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wheel, a basis of Earth-civilization,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They gave Bob every delicacy, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew thin on food that reminded him of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber-cement. It was too much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">chewing gum to be appetizing because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flora of the planet was resilient in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its botanic formations. He did enjoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clear and tasteless water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One month passed, then a second, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob judged from the number of times</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slept. With constant darkness, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to keep an accurate check.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the direction of the deserted city a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint glow began to show in the sky. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only a short time before sunrise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he awaited sight of the bright ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">with longing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Recently, the buildings had begun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sag like those in the deserted city, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the natives hurried about their business</seg><seg type="columnLine">with renewed vigor, as if expecting some</seg><seg type="columnLine">great event.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally Bob was awakened from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound sleep by a rubber-man shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He was hurried down a ramp to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter a car at the entrance. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dixon understood what was happening</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were speeding along the road be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the city. Away from the glow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The road was crowded with cars, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling in the same direction. A gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral exodus from the city--before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun touched it with the terrific heat!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rubber-men constantly ran away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bright disc. They couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand the rays of their own sun! Roads</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely circled the planet, with cities</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at intervals where they could live for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few months. The race had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">migratory to overcome the slowly rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature as their world swung nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun, and they lived the only possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">life under the planetary conditions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob slept several times, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped twice to eat during the trip. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew they had come a long distance, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't realize quite how far until the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were facing the same glow that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in the opposite direction when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they left the city. The trip had carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">them almost halfway around the globe !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The new city was much larger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one they deserted, and accommodated</seg><seg type="columnLine">people from many of the cities in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other zone. There were manufacturing</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants of every type, and industries that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other cities lacked. The main work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet was carried on in this cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tral spot, where they spent more time</seg><seg type="columnLine">than anywhere else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every member of the race gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, where the rubber-men had little</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for the pleasures enjoyed during</seg><seg type="columnLine">other sojourns. Half of the population</seg><seg type="columnLine">labored in fields for many miles around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city, harvesting crops that were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready ripened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as the fields were cleared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were planted -again, and Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the operation with interest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the time they spent in the capital,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they carried on every branch of agri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culture. The ripened crops were har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vested, to be replaced by new seedings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These were left for the effect of the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which carried their development to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletion before the population returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the next dark period.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE BUILDINGS of the city were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in perfect condition, yet they appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have stood for centuries of Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Bob examined many of the struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, without finding the slightest de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One group of workers was busy over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hauling the road-cars, which were all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">important to their existence. Other men</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked on machinery brought from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted cities, to be returned in good</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition upon their next trek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were nearly a million inhab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itants in the capital, as every being on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the globe was concentrated here during</seg><seg type="columnLine">its occupation. They were distributed</seg><seg type="columnLine">among several cities at every other sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even during the time they were car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rying on the work to provide for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, a rubber-man constantly accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied Bob. He wasn't allowed to roam</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city, but was taken by routes which</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided all main thoroughfares. At first</seg><seg type="columnLine">he paid no attention, but it piqued his</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was gaining a conversational</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the language, and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk to his guide. But once he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mistake of calling to the man in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the first loud sound Bob had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard on the planet, and the results were</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomenal. The sound didn't echo or</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverberate, but died out in silence a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment after he spoke. He noticed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of the room was shaking vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lently, as if affected by an earthquake</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and the rubber-man lay unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor! In the world without</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound, his voice was dangerous!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was several minutes before the rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber-man regained consciousness and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">up without realizing what happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He grinned sheepishly at the Earthman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he had slumped to the floor asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the wall of the room stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking, Bob sighed in relief. The sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his voice was too powerful for the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">silient planet, as every vibration of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">world was below even a normal speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day, while riding through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, Bob jumped in amazement. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought for a moment the occupant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another car was a human being. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been mistaken! It was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fleeting glimpse-^--yet his mind kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning to that half-seen face. It stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">out as no other since he had been with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rubber-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he questioned his driver the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was so upset that he almost lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">control of the car, and his grin entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared! Then he denied it so pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusely that it raised suspicion. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was more to that section of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city from which Bob was barred than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had thought? He decided to find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that incident he was allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">even less freedom. The suspicion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">another of his race was on the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet became almost conviction, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he could think of no reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hiding the fact. Why shouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">they allow him to meet this stranger ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people were so friendly it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">improbable they would keep two mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers of another race separated. Cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly the man in the other machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know of his arrival, or he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come searching--if he could !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an alien universe seeing a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's own kind was a great event. Twice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while prospecting on some strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere. Bob had met men and each time</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been a celebration. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked about the other's origin ; both were</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied to meet their kind without ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The longer he was kept under strict</seg><seg type="columnLine">surveillance, the more discontented the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthman became. He learned to al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most hate the unchanging expressions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rubber-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THEN SUSPICION was forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the search for fuel for the spaceship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His mastery of the language was suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficient so he could enter their labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tories and study every process of manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">facture. When he found nothing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might replace ronaline his hopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to despair. When it came time</seg><seg type="columnLine">RESILIENT PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for the exodus from the city he was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching for the secret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Jle had learned to handle the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars and could drive with confidence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their operation was simple and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble-free.

This chem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical dissolved one of the standard min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erals, creating enormous quantities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric energy in the process. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">radicals, in combination, created a force</seg><seg type="columnLine">which strove to push the car away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface. With the power released</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the back of the vehicle, it moved for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward at terrific speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The sun had begun to light the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind.

By</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time of departure they were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same softened condition as those in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other cities at the moment of migration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While traveling, Dixon received the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation of the phenomenon from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  During the dark period, the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed moisture. It rained quite often,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the building material acted like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponge. While the cities were deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the heat of the near-by sun, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface dried out again. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evaporation of moisture, everything re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained its original shape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dixon shook his head hopelessly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood what took place, but couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand how. Upon first acquaintance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the globe he thought synthetic rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber could be manufactured from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural resources, but had found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">composition useless. He couldn't help</seg><seg type="columnLine">but think what a mess the little world</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be if the sun didn't shine for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">period.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For once in his life Bob had enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling. Always before he had kept on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the move because of desire. Now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was forced upon him, the pleasure was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. He dreamed of the time when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stay in one spot for months, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out having to run away from the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The day he sighted the Earth again</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be the happiest moment of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life--if he ever did !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A feeling of hopelessness crept over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. They had to move so often there</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't time to develop a new chemical</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the laboratories. It would require a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifetime of effort to accomplish what</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be done in one year on Earth. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt sorry for these beings who had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move constantly, yet they seemed to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to migration with pleasure--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew no other life. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He passed many cars that were loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">more heavily, while some vehicles passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Bob recognized the car of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruler as it passed. Their own machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried a load of heavy machinery which</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it slower. He was a regular in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitant of the planet now, and helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the work. It was a world where</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone labored, which partly explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">their good nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a glow appeared on the instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel another car streaked by. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">other vehicle moved aside to give it</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. As it passed, Bob glanced up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he gasped! It was the human be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing again--driving alone ! His mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost dropped open. It was a woman!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The headlights of their machine lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior for a moment and he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain view of the occupant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE TRIED desperately to get more</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed from the machine he was driving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but instead of accelerating, it slowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. He was shouting! The rubber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was unconscious from the vibration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Earthman's voice ! The whole car</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shaking. It wobbled and swayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">uniil it required every ounce of Dixon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy to keep from smashing into an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other car. The girl was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an hour before the native re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained consciousness. He didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had taken place, but grinned good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturedly as if he had fallen asleep for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes. The car had stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrating and was operating perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. It was on the lip of Bob's tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hum to the rubber-man about the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his lips remained sealed. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do more if his knowledge remained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They entered a city which might</seg><seg type="columnLine">house 100,000 people, but nothing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparison to the capital. The ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chinery in the car was for use in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power building, and the Earthman</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped install it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was given complete freedom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which made him think the girl must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere else. There was no way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling where she might be. as he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the location of the other cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He couldn't understand why they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to keep him from knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl lived among them. Perhaps they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were jealous of one of her own race,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were afraid he would try to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">her away--which he fully intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do! He would find a way of escaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the little globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Little communication existed between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cities. The people were content to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for nev/s until they returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital. It seemed hopeless to try and</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate the girl until the population again</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled all in the same place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day Dixon was looking through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clear pane in the front of his sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters when a car came racing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street. He still occupied an apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in the building with the ruler, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it must be an emissary from some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other city. It broke the monotony, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hurried toward the ramp, interested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three of the rubber-men came run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, to usher him back to his room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This move flashed the answer--the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking out again, much against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">will of the three natives, he examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car carefully. It had fast lines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be the same machine that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed him on the road. It was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly specially built.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he turned to look at the good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natured grins of his guards, they ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared almost worried. He was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see who came in that car if it meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">declaring war against the whole race.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three men sank to the floor un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious, their grins still in place. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration of his voice caused instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumber. The room shook violently. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't wait to see the effect, but headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the throne room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the doorway he hesitated as four</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber-men ran toward him. He wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain that he was discovered, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have felt the vibration of the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. The girl faced the ruler. It made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob smile to see her shake her finger in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's face--and the ruler didn't ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear very happy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dixon was afraid of what might hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen if he was seen, and shouted again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ruler slid to the floor, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who had been coming toward him</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled up like balls and bounced along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the resilient surface. He and the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood facing each other--her expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of disbelief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he walked forward, she stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered back and the color drained from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face. She seemed almost afraid, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced around in a daze. Suddenly she</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumped to the floor in a faint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A MOMENT LATER he was hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down the ramp with her limp form in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms. Twice, rubber-men tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slop them, and he left them unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a shout. He was going to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl alone, where they could talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before any more natives caught up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">RESILIENT PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the fast car was racing through the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">while people tumbled out of the way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing could catch them if they had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Lights of other cars appeared on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road behind, but he drove like a maniac</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the next city to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied. The girl might know a safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to spend a. few hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There were supplies in the Eagle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if be could locate it they would be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hide as long as necessary. The search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the car would reflect on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, as it wasn't far from the high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. He believed it was not many miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was a vaguely familiar feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the road, and he slowed down. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">light shone across the level ground for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several hundred feet, but a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed before he dared hope they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the section with the spaceship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The girl had regained consciousness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sat staring at him in undisguised</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder, too startled to return his smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of friendship. She was young, with dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair and fair skin. She would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful on Earth, and to the spaceman</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was more than that. Her environ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment had given her a slightly different</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance than girls accustomed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">culture of their own race. Her face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, yet she had acquired some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the humor of the rubber-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last she asked Bob where they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going, using the humming language of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the natives. He replied as best he could,</seg><seg type="columnLine">describing the Eagle as if she had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of a spaceship. Her reply sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I, too, came in a hard-shell boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I was a little girl. These people</seg><seg type="columnLine">have brought me up, and told me that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a child of the skies. That I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only one of my kind who was ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">born, and must live amongst them al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways.

Bright</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lights seemed to race through hi3 brain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the possibility of her identity seeped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his mind. After so long, was it pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible that he had stumbled onto Burk's</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter? It was out of all reason, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">still-?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His mind went back to an event that</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened twelve years before, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seventeen.

It was the Eagle. Nothing else</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the planet would reflect that way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The car swung to the edge of the pave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, then stopped.

They were like children,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught being naughty. The ruler was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much upset at the scolding he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived from Doris, and acted as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would like to hide. They worshipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">(he girl, and were naively ashamed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way they had acted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob showed the rubber-men a sample</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fuel from the Eagle. They didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize it, though he suspected that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they feigned ignorance. The only chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of escape was the fuel in the lifeship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doris informed the rubber-men Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be her mate, and displayed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">proudly. Lack of a companion of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own race had preyed on her mind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was making up for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When they migrated to the central city</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob headed for the small ship immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately.

The auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic controls bad landed it, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber-men found the child almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">starved to death.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">big hand ruffed his shoulder-length hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tugged at a twisted lock that fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind his ear in a familiar gesture. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that cosmic ray shack's going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be too crowded if I have to sit up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that thing," he growled. "Why can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you go on chipping the ice away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">around it--you can do that without any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body butting in, I assure you--and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang the thing up over the power-plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiler?

The dogs were quieter; there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deadly seriousness in their low snarls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taloned feet scratched at hard-packed</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow, broken chains were clinking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Connant shifted abruptly, and Barclay</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see what lay beyond. For a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond he stood frozen, then his breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out in a gusty curse. The Thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">launched itself at Connant, the powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms of the man swung the ice-ax flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side first at what might have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. It scrunched horribly, . and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tattered flesh, ripped by a half-dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage huskies, leapt to its feet again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The red eyes blazed with an unearthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatred, an unearthly, unkillable vitality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barclay turned the fire extinguisher</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it; the blinding, blistering stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical spray confused it, baffled it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">together with the savage attacks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huskies, not for long afraid of anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that did, or could live, held it at bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McReady wedged men out of his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drove down the narrow corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed with men unable to reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene.

One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant blow-torche» used in warming the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane's engines was in his bronzed hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It roared gustily as he turned the corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opened the valve.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half minute be was hacking at it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking back. Van Wall's voice rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in warning shout of "Power!" as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the emergency gasoline-powered dynamo</seg><seg type="columnLine">thudded into action. Half a dozen other</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were down there now; the coal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindling were going into the firebox of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steam power plant.

The dogs were a semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle of red-dipped muzzles with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fringe of glistening white teeth, whining</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a vicious eagerness that near</seg><seg type="columnLine">matched the fury of the red eyes. Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ready stood confidently alert at the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor bend, the gustily muttering torch</seg><seg type="columnLine">held loose and ready for action in bis</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. He stepped aside without mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his eyes from the beast as Barclay</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up. There was a slight, tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile on his lean, bronzed face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norris' voice called down the corri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dor, and Barclay stepped forward. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable was taped to the long handle of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow-shovel, the two conductors split,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held 18 inches apart by a scrap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumber lashed at right angles across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far end of the handle.. Bare copper con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductors, charged with 220 volts, glinted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the light of pressure lamps.

Their whining grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">shriller, softer, their mincing steps car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried them nearer. Abruptly a huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mght-black Alaskan leapt onto the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapped thing.

We want to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">"WHO GOES THERE?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">what happened, and make sure right now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this is permanently, totally dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Connant grinned. "Anybody that</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't can sit up with it to-night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right then, Blair, what can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say about it? What was it?" Garry</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the little biologist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder if we ever saw its natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">form," Blair looked at the covered mass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It may have been imitating the beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">that built that ship--but I don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was. I think that was its true form.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those of us who were up near the bend</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the thing in action; the thing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table is the result. When it got</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose, apparently, it started looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. Antarctica still frozen as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages ago when the creature first saw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and froze. From my observations</seg><seg type="columnLine">while it was thawing out, and the bits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tissue I cut and hardened then, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it was native to a hotter planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Earth. It couldn't, in its natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, stand the temperature. There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">110 life-form 011 Earth that can live in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Antarctica during the winter, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best compromise is the dog. It found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dogs, and somehow got near enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Charpauk to get him. The others</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelled it--heard it--I don't know--</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway they went wild, and broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains, and attacked it before it was fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished. The thing we found was part</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charnauk, queerly only half-dead, part</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charnauk half-digested by the jellylike</seg><seg type="columnLine">protoplasm of that creature, and part the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains of the thing we originally found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of melted down to the basic proto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plasm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the dogs attacked it, it turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the best fighting thing it could think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of. Some other-world beast apparently."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turned," snapped Garry. "How?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Every living thing is made up of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jelly--protoplasm and minute, submicro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopic things called nuclei, which control</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulk, the protoplasm. This thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just a modification of that same</seg><seg type="columnLine">world-wide plan of Nature; cells made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">up of protoplasm, controlled by infinitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinier nuclei. You physicists might com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pare it--an individual cell of any living</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--with an atom; the bulk of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom, the space-filling part, is made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the electron orbits, but the character</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thing is determined by the atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">nucleus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This isn't wildly beyond what vve</seg><seg type="columnLine">already know. It's just a modification</seg><seg type="columnLine">we haven't seen before. It's as natural,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as logical, as any other manifestation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. It obeys exactly the same laws.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cells are made of protoplasm, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">character determined by the nucleus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "ONLY in this creature, the cell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuclei can control those cells at will. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgested Charnauk, and as it digested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied every cell of his tissue, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped its own cells to imitate them ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly. Parts of it--parts that had time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to finish changing--are dog-cells. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they don't have dog-cell nuclei." Blair</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted a fraction of the tarpaulin. A torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog's leg, with stiff gray fur protruded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That, for instance, isn't dog at all; it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">imitation. Some parts I'm uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">about; the nucleus was hiding itself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering up with dog-cell imitation nu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleus. In time, not even a microscope</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have shown the difference."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose," asked Norris bitterly, "it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had lots of time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then it would have been a dog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other dogs would have accepted it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We would have accepted it.

This is a member of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">supremely intelligent race, a race that</seg><seg type="columnLine">has learned the deepest secrets of biol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ogy, and turned them to its use."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was it planning to do?" Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clay looked at the humped tarpaulin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blair grinned unpleasantly. The wa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vering halo of thin hair round his bald</seg><seg type="columnLine">pate wavered in a stir of air.

Garry looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">McReady levelly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norris answered for him, jerkily, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily. "That the creature wasn't dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a sort of enormously slowed exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, an existence that permitted it, none</seg><seg type="columnLine">the less, to be vaguely aware of the pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of time, of our coming, after endless</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. I had a dream it could imitate</seg><seg type="columnLine">things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," Copper grunted, "it can."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't be an ass," Norris snapped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's not what's bothering me.

That</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes more than merely a body that</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks like him; that takes Connant's own</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, and thoughts and mannerisms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore, though you know that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing might make itself look like Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant, you aren't much bothered, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know it has a mind from another</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, a totally unhuman mind, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't possibly react and think and</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk like a man we know, and do it so</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as to fool us for a moment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of the creature imitating one of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">is fascinating, but unreal because it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">too completely unhuman to deceive us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It doesn't have a human mind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I said before," Norris repeated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking steadily at McRcady, "you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">say the damnedest things at the damned-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est times.

"Mi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">croscopic examination," said the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully, "would be useless, as Blair</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out.

If you are--unhuman--you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot more dangerous than poor Blair</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and I'm going to see that he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked up thoroughly. I expect that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">next stage will be a violent desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill you, all the dogs, and probably all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us. When he wakes, he will be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced we're all unhuman, and nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the planet will ever change his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viction. It would be kinder to let him</seg><seg type="columnLine">die, but we can't do that, of course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's going in one shack, and you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay in Cosmos House with your cosmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray apparatus.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog was not anxious to cooperate; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle was painful, and already he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced considerable needle work</seg><seg type="columnLine">that morning. Five stitches held closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slash that ran from his shoulder across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ribs half way down his body. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">long fang was broken off short; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing part was to be found half-buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shoulder bone of the monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing on the table in the Ad Building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long will that take?" Garry</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, pressing his arm gently. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sore from the prick of the needle Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Copper had used to withdraw blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Copper shrugged. "I don't know, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be frank. I know the general method.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've used it on rabbits. But I haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimented with dogs. They're big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsy animals to work with; naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbits are preferable, and serve ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">narily. In civilized places you can buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stock of human-immune rabbits from</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppliers, and not many investigators</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the trouble to prepare their own."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do they want with them back</seg><seg type="columnLine">there?" Clark asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Criminology is one large field. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">says he didn't murder B, but that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood on his shirt came from killing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chicken. The State makes a test, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's up to A to explain how it is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood reacts on human-immune rabbits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not on chicken-immunes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are we going to do with Blair</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the meantime?"

I think perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way the other men look at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes him rather want privacy. Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows, heretofore we've all of us indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidually prayed for a little privacy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark laughed brittley.

He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to have a pretty definite plan in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind when he wakes up. Ever hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old story of how to stop hoof-and-mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease in cattle?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark and Garry shook their heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If there isn't any hoof-and-mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease, there won't be any hoof-and-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth disease," Copper explained. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">get rid of it by killing every animal that</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibits it, and every animal that's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the diseased animal. Blair's a bi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ologist, and knows that story. Pie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of this thing we loosed. The an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer is probably pretty clear in his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Kill everybody and everything in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this camp before a skua gull or a wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering albatross coming in with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring chances out this way and--catches</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disease."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark's lips curled in a twisted grin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sounds logical to me. If things get too</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad--maybe we'd better let Blair get</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose. It would save us committing</seg><seg type="columnLine">suicide. We might also make something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a vow that if things get bad, we see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that that does happen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> COPPER laughed softly. "The last</seg><seg type="columnLine">man alive in Big Magnet--wouldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man," he pointed out. "Somebody's</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to kill those--creatures that don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to kill themselves, you know. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't have enough thermite to do it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once, and the decanite explosive</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't help much. I have an idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even small pieces of one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings would be self-sufficient."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If," said Garry thoughtfully, "they</seg><seg type="columnLine">can modify their protoplasm at will,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">won't they simply modify themselves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds and fly away? They can read all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about birds, and imitate their structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">without even meeting them. Or imi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate, perhaps, birds of their home</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Copper shook his head, and helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clark to free the dog. "Man studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds for centuries, trying to learn how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a machine to fly like them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">never did do the trick; his final success</seg><seg type="columnLine">came when he broke away entirely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried new methods. Knowing the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral idea, and knowing the detailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure of wing and bone and nerve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tissue is something far, far different.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as for other-world birds, perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact very probably, the atmospheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions here are so vastly different</seg><seg type="columnLine">that their birds couldn't fly. Perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even, the being came from a planet like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars with such a thin atmosphere that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no birds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barclay came into the building, trail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a length of airplane control cable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's finished, Doc.

Nobody's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">out there since last fall, have they?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garry shook his head. "If he gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisy--I thought that might be a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barclay hefted the tools he was carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and looked up at Garry.

"I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">care to listen much. You can if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to. But I gathered that the blasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">idiot had all the dreams McReady had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a few more. He slept beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing when we stopped on the trail com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in from Secondary Magnetic, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member. He dreamt the thing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive, and dreamt more details. And--</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn his soul--knew it wasn't all dream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or had reason to. He knew it had tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathic powers that were stirring vaguely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that it could not only read minds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but project thoughts. They weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams, you see. They were stray</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts that thing was broadcasting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way Blair's broadcasting his thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">now--a sort of telepathic muttering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its sleep.

There were no locks in Ant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arctica; there wasn't enough privacy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make them needed.

Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently he had a trap cut in the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which goods could be passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">without unlashing the entrance. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful hinges from a stock-crate, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasps and a pair of three-inch cotter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pins made it proof against opening from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blair moved about restlessly inside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was dragging something over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door with panting gasps and muttering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantic curses. Barclay opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatch and glanced in, Dr. Copper peer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over his shoulder. Blair had moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy bunk against the door.

Little eddies of wind-lifted snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">swirled away from their skis as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">set out toward the main encampment two</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles away. The spidery finger of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcast radiator lifted a gaunt black</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle against the white of the Antarctic</seg><seg type="columnLine">continent.

Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant had a lighted cigarette in each hand ;</seg><seg type="columnLine">one he was puffing absently, and staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the floor. The heat of the one in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand attracted him and he stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and the one in the other hand stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pidly for a moment. He dropped one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crushed it under his heel slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dr. Copper," McReady repeated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"could be right. I know I'm human--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but of course can't prove it. I'll repeat</seg><seg type="columnLine">the test for my own information.

"It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reacts to human blood too, so they aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">both monsters."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't think they were," Van Wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighed. "That wouldn't suit the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster either; we could have destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them if we knew. Why hasn't the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster destroyed us, do you suppose? It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to be loose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McReady snorted. Then laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. "Elementary, my dear Watson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The monster wants to have life forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">available. It cannot animate a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, apparently. It is just waiting--</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting until the best opportunities come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We who remain human, it is holding in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserve."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kinner shuddered violently. "Hey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hey, Mac. Mac, would I know if I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a monster? Would I know if the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster had already got me? Oh Lord, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be a monster already."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd know," McReady answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we wouldn't," Norris laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly, half-hysterically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McReady looked at the vial of serum</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining. "There's one thing this</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned stuff is good for, at that," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said thoughtfully. "Clark, will you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van help me ? The rest of the gang bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter stick together here. Keep an eye on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other," he said bitterly. "See that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you don't get into mischief, shall we</seg><seg type="columnLine">say ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McReady started down the tunnel to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward Dog Town, with Clark and Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wall behind him. "You need more se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rum?" Clark asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McReady shook his head. "Tests.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's four cows and a bull, and nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy dogs down there.

"More immunizing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clark snickered, and stopped with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiccough. "Immunizing. Haw!

That electrocution iron you made</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, Barclay, is very fast. There is only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one dog left--our immune. The mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster left that for us, so we could play</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with our little test.

His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted around the room, and came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest horribly quivering on a tin bucket</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the galley.

Three of the other men were qui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etly being sick.

He went over to the milk</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucket, and with his little tube of serum</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'ent to work on it. The milk clouded</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, making certainty difficult. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dropped the test-tube in the stand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head. "It tests negatively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which means either they were cows</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, or that, being perfect imitations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they gave perfectly good milk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Copper stirred restlessly in his sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave a gurgling cross between a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snore and a laugh.

It's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new individual, with all the desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">protect its own life that the original--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main mass from which it was split</seg><seg type="columnLine">--has. The blood will live--and try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawl away from a hot needle, say!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">McReady picked up the scalpel from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table. From the cabinet, he took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rack of test-tubes, a tiny alcohol lamp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a length of platinum wire set in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little glass rod. A smile of grim satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction rode his lips. For a moment he</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up at those around him. Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clay and Dutton moved toward him</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, the wooden-handled electric in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strument alert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dutton," said McReady, "suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">you stand over by the splice there where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've connected that in. Just make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure no--thing pulls it loose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dutton moved away. "Now, Van,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose you be first on this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> White-faced, Van Wall stepped for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. With a delicate precision, Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ready cut a vein in the base of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb. Van Wall winced slightly, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">held steady as a half inch of bright blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">collected in the tube. McReady put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube in the rack, gave Van Wall a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of alum, and indicated the iodine bottle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Van Wall stood motionlessly watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. McReady heated the platinum wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the alcohol lamp flame, then dipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">it into the tube. It hissed softly. Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">times he repeated the test. "Human,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd say." McReady sighed, and straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened. "As yet, my theory hasn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually proven--but I have hopes. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have hopes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't, by the way, get too interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this. We have with us some unwel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come ones, no doubt. Van, will you re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve Barclay at the switch? Thanks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">O. K., Barclay, and may I say I hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">you stay with us? You're a damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">good guy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barclay grinned uncertainly; winced</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the keen edge of the scalpel. Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently, smiling widely, he retrieved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-handled weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Samuel Dutt--Bar!'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE TENSITY was released in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">second. Whatever of hell the monsters</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have had within them, the men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that instant matched it. Barclay had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to move his weapon as a score</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men poured down 011 the thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seemed Dutton. It mewed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spat, and tried to grow fangs--and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred broken, torn pieces. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out knives, or any weapon save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute-given strength of a staff of picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, the thing was crushed, rent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly they picked themselves up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes smouldering, very quiet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their motions. A curious wrinkling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lips betrayed a species of nervous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barclay went over with the electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon. Things smouldered and stank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The caustic acid Van Wall dropped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each spilled drop of blood gave off tick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling, cough-provoking fumes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McReady grinned, his deep-set eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">alight and dancing. "Maybe," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly, "I underrated man's abilities when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said nothing human could have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocity in the eyes of that thing we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found. I wish we could have the oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to treat in a more befitting man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner these things. Something with boil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing oil, or melted lead in it, or maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow roasting in the power boiler.

Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ready swished the scalpel in absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">alcohol, burned it off the metal blade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cut the base of his thumb expertly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty seconds later he looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the desk at the waiting men. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were more grins out there now, friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SC1ENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grins, yet withal, something else in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Connant," McReady laughed softly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"was right. The huskies watching that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the corridor bend had nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on you. Wonder why we think only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wolf blood has the right to ferocity?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe on spontaneous viciousness a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolf takes tops, but after these seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">days--abandon all hope, ye wolves who</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter here!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe we can save time.

Garry</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddered and sat back in his bunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thirty seconds later, Garry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood shrank from the hot platinum</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire, and struggled to escape the tube,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled as frantically as a suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">feral, red-eyed, dissolving imitation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garry struggled to dodge the snake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue weapon Barclay advanced at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-faced and sweating. The Thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the test-tube screamed with a tiny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinny voice as McReady dropped it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glowing coal of the galley stove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"THE LAST OF IT ?"

The twilight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly 12 hours long, flaming in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north on snow like white, crystalline</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand under their skis. A 5-mile wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled it in drift-lines pointing off to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northwest. Three quarters of an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach the snow-buried shack. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke came from the little shack, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men hastened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blair!"

"Alba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tross-" Barclay said softly. "First</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the season, and wandering way in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land for some reason. If a monster's</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norris bent down on the ice, and tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly at his heavy, windproof cloth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He straightened, his coat flapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, a grim blue-metaled weapon in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. It roared a challenge to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white silence of Antarctica.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing in the air screamed hoarsely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its great wings worked frantically as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen feathers floated down from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail. Norris fired again. The bird was</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving swiftly now, but in an almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight line of retreat. It screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, more feathers dropped and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating wings it soared behind a ridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pressure ice, to vanish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norris hurried after the others.

"Lord help us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">if that thing has-" He grabbed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Barclay's shoulder, and made snipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">motions with his fingers, pointing to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the lacing of control-cables that</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barclay drew the wire-cutters from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket, and kneeled soundlessly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. The snap and twang of cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires made an unbearable racket in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter quiet of the Antarctic hush. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only that strange, sweetly soft hum</seg><seg type="columnLine">from within the shack, and the queerly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hecticly clipped clicking and rattling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools to drown their noises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McReady peered through a crack in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. His breath sucked in huskily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his great fingers clamped cruelly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barclay's shoulder.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing dissolved as he held it, a white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot band that ate into the flesh of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands like living fire.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thing on the floor shrieked, flailed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindly with tentacles that writhed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">withered in the bubbling wrath of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow-torch.

Alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and undisturbed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McReady looked in at the shack more</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully.

At the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">a block ©f rough stone rested. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the block came the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that flooded the place, the fiercely blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">light bluer than the glare of an electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc, and from it came the sweetly soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">hum. Off to one side was another</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism of crystal glass, blown with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an incredible neatness and delicacy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal plates and a queer, shimmery</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere of insubstantiality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is that?"

He shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head negatively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dr. Botts switched off the current and</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed the wires. He wrote on a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper, "I am afraid you are deaf."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mentally he noted that some superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">term was needed to convey an expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of Mr. Clews' conditions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr.. Theodore Clews' cup of woe</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed over. It was not bad enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nobody had ever called him Ted;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had been forced to wear long</seg><seg type="columnLine">curls to the age of 12; that his mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">had still taken all but two dollars of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay at 25; that fourteen younger, less</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced and less efficient bookkeep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers had been advanced over him; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was less than dust to his tyran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nous wife! Now, suddenly, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone deaf. He broke down and wept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Botts caught himself ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make tests of the ultrashort-wave radia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of a mortal afflicted with stagger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing grief. He reminded himself this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a client and withstrained his curiosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">with effort. It was a truly amazing case</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the first case of absolute utter deafness</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor had ever witnessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor was not beset by tradi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional ethics and conscience. With fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger and thumb he held his lips to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether a moment. No use thinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reconstructing Mr. Clews' ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing apparatus. It was defunct for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But something might be done with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nervous system.

The delicate operation had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a success. Already, he could hear better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever before. It was a strange type</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hearing which had given him moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of uneasy thought during the past few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, but it was hearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will take several months for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new system to become completely syn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chronized with your motor nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">system," the doctor announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Clews went timidly back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">five-room flat and the stored-up tyranny</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his wife. Except that her loud ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cusations had become more strident, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life did not seem to have changed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only ill effect of the operation was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had become more nervous. The clat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of adding machines in the office be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to drive him into frenzy. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratch of his pen reached such a pitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had to change to a snub-nosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">stub.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three months had passed before Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clews ran out of immediate faults to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find with her husband.

His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright and his gaze was riveted on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TERRIBLE SENSE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well that's a fine one for her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the daughter of a police captain to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have for a husband!" she commented</seg><seg type="columnLine">scathingly. "Scared of a cat! Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">say a word, Theodore Clew-s, it's written</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your face as clear as day!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Clews jumped and colored. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to crouch less conspicuously in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the chair. But inevitably his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze returned to the cat and he subcon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciously moved forward to the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his seat. But oddly, he was not looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the cat when it silently yawned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted. Yet Theodore Clews knew what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cat had done as if a photograph had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been flashed in his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard it! He even heard the cat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">toes go back together!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cat started to lick itself, stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its head swinging toward corners of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Intently it gazed with its fiery</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, rolling onto haunches ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring. Suddenly it looked at Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clews. A second it glared. Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissed, leaped in a somersault and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed from the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For minutes, Mr. Clews' heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumped like a sledge hammer. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage glare of the cat had put his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his throat. But it occurred to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cat had been equally as afraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about him. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure what. Like his wife, the cat had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been wont either to disdain him alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, or else accept him very conde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scendingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cat's fear slowly filled Mr. Clews</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sense of well being. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">before had ever been afraid of him. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had impressed his importance as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--well, at least upon the cat. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to bed well pleased with life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had forgotten to open the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">which faced a dark court. The room</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cluttered with tables, chairs, trunks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and boxes, but he made his way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window in the dark without touching a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Theodore Clews was not very</seg><seg type="columnLine">observant or he would have been sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">prised that he knew where every object</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. He could not have explained, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could have told that the big bureau</seg><seg type="columnLine">was precisely seven feet two inches from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very spot w'here he stepped into bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> NOISES began to become a very im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant part of Mr. Clews' life. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise of adding machines and typewrit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers had first annoyed him. Now they</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened him, so that he would pause</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bottom of a row of figures and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to grip the desk with sudden trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling. He eyed the quiet, sound-proofed</seg><seg type="columnLine">office of the chief bookkeeper, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been advanced over him, with envy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealousy. It was the first time he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever been truly jealous of another man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The riotous noise of rushing crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">at closing time drove Mr. Clews near</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysteria. He began staying late, finishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up odds and ends of work he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid much attention to. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly difficult piece of accounting to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done which had to be done on outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Clews' chief noticed his penchant</seg><seg type="columnLine">for working late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think about Clews do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it ?" he asked the big boss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big boss chuckled. "Just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man! He's too scared to even think</seg><seg type="columnLine">what's behind figures!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was dark when Clews would leave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to avoid the noise he took to walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing home through the less used and</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker back streets. It did not occur to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but he seldom used his eyes to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he was going. He simply knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he came to alleys and crossings--</seg><seg type="columnLine">where lamp-posts and people were--</seg><seg type="columnLine">without looking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At home, the cat began to grow thin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At night it slunk onto the fire-escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">with swift backward glances at Clews.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But not all cats were as frightened. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">toughy in the dock district had waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silently stalked him many nights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each night it crept a little closer behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for a block.</seg><seg type="columnLine">102</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-* ICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One night it began to gallop on silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Clews was thinking of that special</seg><seg type="columnLine">job he was doing when he suddenly felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm and leaped straight up. The cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed beneath him with open mouth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsheathed claws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clews started to run without thinking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he remembered the fear their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own cat had of him. He whirled. Along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark pavement the cat was galloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a low crouch. He could not see it</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly, could barely define movement in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow. The cat tensed and leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in attack. At the same second, Clews</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped aside. Without thinking, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out and caught the cat by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail. Before he realized what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, he had dashed its brains out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His act appalled him and made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly sick. Then he began to enjoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sensation of victory. By the time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived home he was glad he had killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cat. When he thought of it again at</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner, he licked his lips a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daily, the p^ise at the office was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming more deafening to his system.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He began to hate the noise and the peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple responsible for it. His fear turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to anger. Particularly was it focused</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the man who had that quiet, sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proofed office, his immediate chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not notice it, but he no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to see who was approaching. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew long before he was fully conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their footsteps or voices. He was sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting 011 one side of a partition with Will</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flanagan at noon one day when Will</seg><seg type="columnLine">said idly, "I wonder exactly what Marie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevens is doing at one minute to</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	"Combing her hair," Theodore said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was not guessing. She might just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well have been powdering or rouging.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he knew she was combing her hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Will looked around the partition and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "Jeepers!" He gave Clews a pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culiar look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other bookkeepers began making</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of remarks like that to Clews. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">long as they asked about somebody in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room, or standing in a draft blowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room, Clews usually knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer. A week later they framed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had Marie Stevens sit absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet behind a filing case. They led up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the idea and asked Clews.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clews' mind went blank with concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tration. He had not discovered how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew things yet. He had not even dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered he was being kidded. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second he said seriously, "She's trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be quiet. But she's chewing gum."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The committee ran to investigate. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. They did not notice that the effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of absolute control made her breathe a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little harder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THEY BEGAN to dodge Clews' eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">after that, and to avoid being close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. But he did not notice their new</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude. He was busy with the special</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. Free minutes were filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing rage at the noise around him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jealousy of the man with that quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. Suddenly it occurred to Clews</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get that man's job. It was simply an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea intention. He had never tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get another man's job before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Summer came on, and Clews donned</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin clothing. On hot days when he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the office in shirt sleeves, the noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">was deafening. When he stretched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms to cool the perspiration the noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him shiver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was stretching when he suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard his boss talking. It surprised him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his boss was nowhere in the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He put his elbows on his desk and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound ceased. Later he stretched again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again he heard his boss. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, holding his arms out and turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">subconsciously. He dropped one arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an angle. He heard the voice as if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were next to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clews turned white with the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery, but he listened. It was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about that special job he was doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">after hours. The other, lower voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big boss. Beads of perspiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TERRIBLE SENSE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">popped out on timid Clews' forehead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That job was the private account of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm--the account the government did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see. When he sat down to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">over this awful discovery, the voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. A mosquito floated through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. Without thinking. Clews</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out and grabbed it in flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His wife was in a particular temper</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night. She railed for an hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clews thought the racket of her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">would drive him mad. "Well," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally screeched, "can't you answer?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her voice hit a highly unpleasant note.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It rasped across Clews' nerves like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">file.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked up at her, his eyes going</seg><seg type="columnLine">red with rage. Before he knew what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done, he had knocked her down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stood gaping with surprise while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed up his coat and went out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clews walked along a dark street deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thought. He was surprised that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not more shocked at his own action.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somehow, it had seemed the thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. She'd have to stop using those</seg><seg type="columnLine">strident notes unless she wanted him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night was filled with a world of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound-pictures. He knew that four peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple walked out of a house a block distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned toward the waterfront. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard radios, but that was expected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he knew that somebody on either the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third or fourth floor rear of the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the street turned on their water</seg><seg type="columnLine">faucet. He tilted his head to one side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without thinking, one of his arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs lifted and moved slowly about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he knew the person using that</seg><seg type="columnLine">water was a woman. It had a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound hitting on masculine flesh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he put his leg down, he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a night shift was using picks on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new subway far beneath. He felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumble of a truck, and then another simi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar rumble. But he knew that one truck</seg><seg type="columnLine">was running west, three streets north,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the other one was in the ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cavation underfoot. There was a ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible din northward, but out of it he</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked the bell of a fire engine. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be about a mile and a half away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">HE WAS THIRSTY and passed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little restaurant. Out behind was a quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">summer garden with soft lights. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out and sat down. The waiter</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up and stood behind his line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision, but he knew the waiter was six</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet tall, and knew the length of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ordered a lemonade made of fresh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut lemons. The waiter disappeared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clews absently stretched a leg and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested his arm over another chair. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not notice his arm jumping nerv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The waiter brought a lemonade and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clews said, "That's not fresh lemons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want lemons cut and squeezed special."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The waiter said, "That's what I gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clews looked at him and said, "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">had this squeezed in a pitcher in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">icebox. You put the ice in the glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">before you poured the lemon juice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The waiter swallowed, gawked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanched and took the lemonade back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clews was momentarily frightened at</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had said. How did he know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that? The kitchen was back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. But he knnu it! He got over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fright and began to feel proud of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge. Why should he be scared ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could scare other people!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man and a woman came in and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a distant table. Clews knew the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his big boss without looking. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman laughed, and Clews felt pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain she was not the boss' wife. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">readjusted his position without thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heard the murmured conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctly. No, it was not the wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">After a few drinks the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed more and louder. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an irritating quality to her voice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Clews moved to the inside bar without</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at them. He sat with bis feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the upper rung of the high stool and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms doubled closely against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of his chest. It was better this</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. He did not hear that grating</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman passed behind him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard his boss come up. The boss</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed and ordered drinks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't realize you were a drinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, Clews! Well, a long one doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do any harm in this heat, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clews ordered another lemonade. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't like the sound of the boss' voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It held an unconvincing tone of smooth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. It annoyed him and it made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of the office and that private job</seg><seg type="columnLine">for which he wasn't paid a dime extra.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss took half his drink and said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"By the way, this little meeting will just</seg><seg type="columnLine">be between us two ?" There was a threat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tone. It made Clews angry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clews said, "I should have had Dice's</seg><seg type="columnLine">job. I was senior and I know more</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boss colored. "That's rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-handed, Clews!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So are those private books," Clews</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. He looked at the boss for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. When he raised his arm to drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that the boss was scared. Clews</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear his heart pounding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll see what we can do tomorrow,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boss said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next week Clews was put in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of his department. He got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound-proofed room. He breathed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief. He wasn't frightened and angered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by noise all the time in there! And--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work of the department picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately. The clerks kept their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Clews when he came through, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few of them said silent prayers. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncanny that he could tell them at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the day that they had been read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a book or writing a letter instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">working on figures when he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean across the room!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THERE WAS a lot that was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canny about Clews lately, they whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered. For one thing, he didn't pay any</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to where he was going, yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never hit anything. Then there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he acted. Sometimes when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening his arm or leg would go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vibrate like a throbbing pipe. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard every word they said no mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter how quietly they whispered!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When fall came, Clews grew more</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous than ever. The streets were</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of traffic noise during the daytime.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It actually pained him at times. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was developing a fondness for night</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaming which left him tired and groggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next day. He was nervous, too, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his increasing knowledge of an unpleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant kind. A laugh, a word, a swift mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and he would size people up. How,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had no idea. But he would know</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were shallow, scheming, disloyal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishonest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was startling the number of people</seg><seg type="columnLine">who weren't what they seemed. Down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the office they all smiled pleasantly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but they hated him. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened of him. He knew that from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise their motions made as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed by them. Sometimes he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have his foot out in the hall and hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they were whispering about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was shocked by the crookedness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the firm he worked for, too. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet have the courage of his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">victions or he would have reported them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had learned too much--more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wanted to know. As on the day be</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his hand on the wall of the presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent's office and heard the conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a prominent politician inside. Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day he laid his finger tips on a tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone cord and heard what was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">said over the wire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't want to know those things!</seg><seg type="columnLine">They upset him, made him mad at him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and disgusted with life! He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing the few friends he had ever had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">also. Part of this was bis fault. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them had given him time just out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TERRIBLE SENSE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pity, or because they were in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, or out of amusement. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">why they had put up with him now. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it from the fine differences of tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">they used with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was something more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. He frightened them lately. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">motions were strangely nervous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick, and sometimes he answered re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks they had thought, but had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated. He would say, "Here comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">John," when John was still half a block</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and around the corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And occasionally he dropped things</seg><seg type="columnLine">which showed he knew a lot of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had said behind his back or in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">privacy of their homes. Such as the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie consoled Mary Bevins, who lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">three floors lower down in a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, because her husband had left her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It hadn't been a loud quarrel and Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">was telling people that he was just away</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a business trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only satisfaction in life was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had tamed his wife. It had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">some outbursts of rage and fists which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was thoroughly ashamed of when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought about it. But it had had a sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prising effect. She had become docile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loving, quiet, soft-spoken. In fact she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become a new woman. Where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been wont to yell with a piercing</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, she now sang softly. It had af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected her temperament. She was happy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She told her cronies about what a cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able and self-reliant man Mr. Clews was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first cold of winter struck bitterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Theodore's bones. It hurt him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt very sleepy. He would go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep the minute he got home. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning he woidd find himself doubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with his knees beneath his chin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands firmly clenching the footboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frightened, he went to see Dr. Botts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did more analyzing about matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">lately because so many new and inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicable events took place in his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had figured out that his sleepiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have something to do with his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">audio operation. The city noise had</seg><seg type="columnLine">assaulted his nerves, and perhaps he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">run down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Botts was away for a year in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">j ungles!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> BLEAKLY, Clews faced the fact.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nobody who could do any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for him. Nobody else could even</seg><seg type="columnLine">find anything wrong or different with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him! For the first time in his life, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down and seriously analyzed himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his private life. For the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized how his character, as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his body and nerves, had changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he was sleepy, so terribly sleepy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could barely pull through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. He felt he would simply have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a month off. He went to see his</seg><seg type="columnLine">president.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a conference inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. Clews sat down wearily against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall and spread his arms. Instantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard every word said inside. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">president was trying to put through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal, and whoever he was talking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted a higher price.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Clews paid closer heed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something about the man's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">voice- He began to make mental</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">notes of his reactions.

He was too sleepy to think much</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. He was almost asleep when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the president burst in that afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a white face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">106</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That man this morning was from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton &amp; Co., our sharpest rivals!</seg><seg type="columnLine">They've got our inside price and a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess at production costs!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clews shrugged wearily. "He sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked," he said simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The president looked at Clews</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely. He said, "Clews, you do. look</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick. I think a winter in the south is</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you need. I'm giving you enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go south for six months."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Clews didn't go south. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">home and went to bed. In a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wakeful state he kept trying to get fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther under the covers. His wife went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and while she was gone he crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the closet and crawled inside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving in a sleep-walking trance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> SLOWLY, a feeling of cramped in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity came to him. Sluggish life</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed returning to long-stiffened arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and legs. His eyes blinked open, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut hastily. A low, purring hum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer sounds welled up, and through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft, low twittering of birds. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a breeze ruffled leaves. Clews</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook himself slightly, uneasily, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The surroundings dazed his slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakening mind. Something, vaguely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wrong with his room. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark and brown draped peculiarly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of him. Sensation messages from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nerves of arms and legs began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">convey meaning. His legs were hooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the coat-rail in his closet, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hanging head-down, quite comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably, but extremely hungry. He belched</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly and swung stiffly to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His wife was coming, he knew sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, and he relaxed gently on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, seated with arms queerly angled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His wife entered, and looked at him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no surprise, but a vague satisfaction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hungry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded slowly. His neck was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff. "Very."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were last week." She went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Slowly her words penetrated to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his wakening mind. He turned gingerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked out the window. His arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted and moved about. The twittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of birds grew stronger. A pair of blue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds were struggling with a tangle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">string in the crotch of the old maple</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree. He could scarcely see them be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the leaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's--spring," said Mr. Clews</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbly, when his wife returned with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep cup of broth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May," she nodded. Her voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm, but her eyes were frightened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You--you hibernated. I--I went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor, but he was gone--the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that operated on you--and his assistant</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. He said to let you alone. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">woke up a little a week ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Clews drank the soup, and hic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuped gently. His head nodded forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he crawled toward the bed. "I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right," he said, with a peculiar cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty of knoAvledge. He crawled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bed, and went to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Six hours later he woke up again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate some more. In a week he was mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around, the queer stiffness going</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his limbs. He felt fine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> CLEWS made his first trips out late</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night. He took careful stock of him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self now. He had changed even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the winter. His motions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">three times as quick, and often he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop and wheel, almost dancing, at some</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange noise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cop standing quietly in a doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly said, "Well, well, butterfly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">come along and we'll find a nice cocoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clews darted away in terror and hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible realization of his motions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He kept to even later hours and less</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequented districts along the waterfront</seg><seg type="columnLine">after that. He tried to avoid people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he got in the center of a brightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted block one night when groups</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out of bars at both corners and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood lounging on the curb. He had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass one. He checked his motions as</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TERRIBLE SENSE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">107</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">much as possible, but his steps were light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dainty, and he had the feeling that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fluttered down the block. Any distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">or near-by sound and involuntarily his</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivering arms and legs would leap out</seg><seg type="columnLine">or his head cock to one side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tough drunk at the corner watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his progress. He stepped out and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">badgering. Clews' undeniable instinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to run. But something in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough's voice turned his fear to anger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A psychiatrist might have told him.the</seg><seg type="columnLine">root of anger is fear. He told the tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shut up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, for cripes' sake, listen at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prissy telling me to shut up!" roared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough. He stepped nearer and made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden feint and pass. It whistled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clews head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> CLEWS HAD never had a fight in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life. The mere thought terrified him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For ten minutes he avoided annihilation</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply because he heard the fighter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion and dodged. He had no con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious thought of dodging; it was sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">timed nervous reaction. He was utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the roars of the tough began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">goad him. A particular stream of curses</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a high-pitched note which made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">see red. He began fighting back, sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agely, with no idea of how to fight, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumping in and out like a--bat! They</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled him off the tough when his teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sinking into the man's throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute, wait a minute, wild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat!" a dapper member of the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Man, if you're going to kill 'em,</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the public pay to see it! Come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have a drink and cool off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clews went in because he was taken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sat down shaking like a leaf. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared he had just butchered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightweight champ!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't look like much," the dap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per man said, "but I've never seen such</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful weaving and timing in my life!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, fellow, you'll make a fortune!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You don't even need to hit 'em. They'll</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">go down from missing you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Clews could understand quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">how it had happened, he was on his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to becoming lightweight champion. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous, fluttering, perfect timing of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">motions packed the arenas. Never had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man behaved like that in the ring be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore ! But it was the goods--nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched him in twelve fights! By then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was learning about fighting, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got against tougher opponents he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could lean and take their punches. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they seldom landed. Clews was too fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his jittery, pulsing, nervous man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">euvers. No matter what tricks they</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled, he seemed to sense them, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of their punches, the timing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and power in them, and be somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">else when they arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then his own knockout began, for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">timing was perfect, and once he learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hit, it did not take much power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch his opponent on the canvas. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitably, these knockouts were correlated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the size and yelling of the crowd.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would come in the same round</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a certain tempo and note and</seg><seg type="columnLine">decibel measurement of the crowd's roar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fierceness with which Clews hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was something uncontrollable, ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely not part of his conscious self.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was direct reflex of that roar on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves of his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobody ever knew the torture, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer physical pain, those roars caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He struck out in nervous frenzy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The night the crowd increased its roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">after he knocked out the champ, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">K.

Loyally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife accompanied him in public, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">at home he caught her sobbing at times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when she looked at him or he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hugged her closely, there was terror in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know what's come over you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ted," she said once--she called him</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ted" now--"it gives me the creeps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It isn't just you hanging like that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">108</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">winter.

He turned, and with screams of</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror they rushed away. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at his arm and saw it was oscil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating rapidly in a peculiar, half-turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">position. His fingers were open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved without any volition of his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shivered, and drew his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly to his sides. He knew exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">how far the cats had gone! Two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them had gone to the back of a house;</seg><seg type="columnLine">one had raced along the street and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned east.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Theodore Clews felt very unhappy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was rich, and popular with crowds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his "eccentricities" were now called</seg><seg type="columnLine">"form" and studied. But he was losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife. And, oddly, he was in love</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this woman who had upbraided him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for so many years.

Since Astounding began, it has conducted a type of Analytical</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laboratory--Brass Tacks. But the results of the analyses have not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">published. We have tried to draw conclusions as to the character, the likes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dislikes, of you who read the magazine from the letters. It has, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see, helped develop a better magazine because it helped us know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">better meant to you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Philosophers and logicians have developed a sort of mathematics of logics.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let this idea be represented by the symbol A, and this other idea by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">symbol B. Then-The whole purpose of that symbolism is to escape the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulties of human reactions to words, reactions arising from past experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ences. What does power mean? A man says "I want power!" If he is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical engineer, speaking to a group of engineers, he is thinking in terms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of kilowatts. If he is a statesman--or a general--or a plain politician--his</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning may be any of three other things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  What meaning that word power conjures up in his mind depends on past</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiences, his previous environment. It may vary from one purely intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lectual concept--the mathematical symbols of an Einstein--to another entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">different purely intellectual concept; the vision of a great statesman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  What, then, is a better story? The Analytical Laboratory has ana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyzed and summarized the direct reactions as shown by your letters. Natur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, I'm keenly interested in what you thought of stories I thought were good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the important thing is the future, not the past. The Analytical Labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory is designed to help me, and the authors, to know what you will like even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than to know what you did like.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  What is power in a story, in your estimation?

Magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing locks snapped open. The short</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing rolled into a small box upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders.

Or those in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fernal Venusians! This part of New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York was extremely popular with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants of Earth's neighboring plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets. Especially after midnight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greg was hungry. The new Inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary Restaurant was just around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner. It was a dandy place to pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">up news items for his ten-minute col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umn in the New York Radio Star. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A rotund Venusian rolled swiftly to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward him. Fennel jumped aside. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusian rolled to the outer edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk and went swiftly on his way. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, round head stuck out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of one side like a black hub cap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greg cursed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They ought to put a speed limit on</seg><seg type="columnLine">those living pinwheels!

The restau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rant occupied a ground-floor segment</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the middle of the block. The seg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment adjoining it was still lighted. Greg</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught soft strains of Martian music as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he passed. The proprietors, two lanky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians, were sitting in front of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ether-phones for which they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agents. The taller of the two raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. Fennel recognized him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Harg, the shrewdest spy in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solar System!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greg stopped. He looked upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He wondered what Harg was doing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. But ostentatiously, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">surveying the air lanes above the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were still a few flyers in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perambulator Lane, the lowest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three.

But quite a few green flying-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights were visible in the Speed Lane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the blue flashes of the Air Police</seg><seg type="columnLine">were everywhere. Fennel hardly saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harg was news. He represented the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire Solar System. He was probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most important spy in the Inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary Espionage. Some day, Greg</seg><seg type="columnLine">told himself, he would belong to thac.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had already taken the first step. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a member of the American Se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cret Police for over six months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fennel sighed and turned away. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better not play around with Harg. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian was news he did not dare</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle. He entered the restaurant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bert Lippert conducted him to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">booth. Lippert was one-third owner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other two-thirds was owned by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flan, a Martian, and Bellon, a Venu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian. Fennel disliked both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Glad you came, Greg," Lippert</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted him. "You've been leaving us</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of your air column lately. Why?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No news, Bert." Fennel adjusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrow on the menu set in the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">top and punched the various dishes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted. "I don't handle advertising.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Give me news and your restaurant goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the air."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Greg." Lippert dropped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chair on the other side of the table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This joint is full of news. So full I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid. The biggest blow-up the Solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">System has ever seen is due to happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in less than a week. And I'm in it. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't want to be, but I am!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jupiter Juice?" That soothing, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanity-producing liquor was outlawed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Greg knew it could be gotten right</seg><seg type="columnLine">here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">114</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, that! Hell, no." Lippert waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea aside. "We handle it, sure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You know that. But it's cut below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger point, and the city police inspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Our customers don't know that, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, or they wouldn't think they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being devilish when they bought it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's the belly-ache, then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> GREG WAS becoming curious. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">something big was going to happen, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would explain Harg's presence next</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. And if he, Fennel, could uncover</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, he would be up for a place on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Interplanetary just like that!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's Bellon. That bloated Venu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian's getting ideas. He's been hob-nob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing with the folks back home lately. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened in. Venus wants a colony!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure she does." Greg admitted it</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily. He flipped open a door in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall and rolled out a steaming tray.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ah! Roast beef flanked by Martian po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatoes! And a huge plate of Venusian</seg><seg type="columnLine">mushrooms! He started to eat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke between mouthfuls. "Sure Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants a colony. But she won't buy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Martians offered to sell Diemos,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their smaller moon, a long time ago."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aw, who wants that chunk of iron!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Venusians have bigger ideas. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">want a planet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fennel carefully laid down his fork.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mean--Earth?" he inquired softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No." Lippert leaned forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew designs on the tablecloth with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger. "They want the Asteroids, All</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greg gripped his wrist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you crazy, Bert?" Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned back and grinned. "You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken a shot of Jupiter Juice. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asteroids belong to Earth. Why, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a third of them are peopled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthlings! We'd never sell them. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">for taking them by force, we could blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus to pieces if she tried."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure we could! But she's going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. In fact, she has already. Notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">any funny flashes in the sky lately ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and I know what they were. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of the tiny Asteroids collided.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobody knows why. But no damage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was done so we're not worrying!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know why. And I'm worrying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. The Venusians did that. They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to assemble the Asteroids into one</seg><seg type="columnLine">large planet. They've got a base on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars, and a bunch of Martians are help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them. There'll be hell to pay in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">week or so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute, Bert. It doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">make sense, but there may be something</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this. How can they assemble the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asteroids ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gravity." Lippert glanced at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">row of booths opposite them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All were occupied. Most of the oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupants were Venusians, but there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair sprinkling of Earthlings and Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians among them. One booth held</seg><seg type="columnLine">three Saturnian apes. They looked sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, but were from a very intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">race. None took any interest in what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lippert was doing so he went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It's so darned simple, Greg. Look.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your gravity repulsor nullifies gravity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't it? If you turn it on and jump,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or get some sort of a send, you keep on</seg><seg type="columnLine">going and don't come back until you</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut it off again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's common knowledge. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">has that to do with this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Greg. Now take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity amplifier. You turn one on</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you're wearing it and you stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">' rooted to the spot. In fact, if you turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">it on strong enough, the increased grav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity will flatten you out like a pancake!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure.

Lippert</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned forward and talked fast. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asteroids are scattered along one orbit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They exert more or less gravity upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other. Suppose two, fairly close</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, were to have their gravity for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all others nullified and their gravity for</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other amplified.

The Vcnusians did that to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some so small they attracted little at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention. They crashed. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing near enough to attract the fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pieces, and these settled together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A loose, spongy mass. But, as this mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">increases, its natural gravity will in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease also. The mass will settle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">harden. In time, it could be built into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a planet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It could be.

Anything in the line of news</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the party room ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE VENUSIAN had approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently. He was less than three feet tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than three feet in diameter. Fen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel knew that the belt around Bellon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist, upon which the Venusian rolled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than ten feet long. One had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stoop to see the stunted, thick legs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the arms made up for that short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness by being fully five feet from shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der to wrist. They had no joints and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be coiled and twisted in a snake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like manner. They were usually wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Venusians' necks with only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple feet left to dangle at their sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "News?" Bellon lifted his pig-eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Fennel's face. "There is news only</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this room, Greg Fennel. But news</seg><seg type="columnLine">you might hear here is not to be passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the radio. Is it, Bert?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greg said nothing. Lippert was</seg><seg type="columnLine">again drawing pictures, tracing them</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly and carefully.

Fennel</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out upon the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The double doors leading to the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">room closed. Just inside the booth</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, stood Flan. The Martian propri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">116</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">etor was aiming a needle pistol at Greg's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put up the gun, Greg," he ordered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's the trouble?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fennel's lips twitched. He was fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused. But he controlled his anger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcing himself to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had to get out. Had to notify the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper authorities of what had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatched in the Interplanetary Restau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rant. He looked behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The floor was crowded. Each booth</seg><seg type="columnLine">had belched its quota of Earthlings, Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians, or Venusians upon the tile sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Every man was armed, held a</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle pistol pointed at him. Except</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three Saturnian apes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THEY HAD not moved. They still</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat at their table, calmly eating. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes missed nothing. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">frankly curious, yet their attitude told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him plainly that they intended to mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own business and were not to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn into the present squabble. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturnians seldom mingled with the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planetarians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fennel slowly pocketed his gun. Bcl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lon waddled from the booth where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken refuge. He was all smiles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good work, Flan." He nodded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extremely thin, eight-foot Martian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flan lowered his long arm and tucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pistol under his belt. His enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">head wagged. Fennel always expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear the thin neck crack whenever a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian nodded. But in spite of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicatc appearance, the Martians were</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extremely hardy and powerful race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What now, Bellon? We can keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">up this restaurant farce no longer. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">we not better leave ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Immediately, Flan." Bellon turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to where his countrymen had gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into as close a mass as their girths</seg><seg type="columnLine">would permit. "Ganot, go at once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather our Venusian crews. Have them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all roll down to our airport. You will</seg><seg type="columnLine">take off at daybreak and go straight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus. Explain things to our govern-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and tell them to begin operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as possible. Then lead the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet back to the Asteroids."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ganot bowed. He spoke to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men around him, and most of them fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him through the rear door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Bellon instructed the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You, Hagai, gather the crews for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our Martian base. You will command</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venus detachment and be under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders of Stor. Stor will lead the ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mars, collect our fleet, and load them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ail available gravity repulsors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">amplifiers. Then head back for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asteroids. We will be waiting at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting place in our flagship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stor, a tall Martian, assented with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim smile. He said something to Ha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gai, and all but two of the Venusians and</seg><seg type="columnLine">four of the Martians left the room. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthlings, a dozen hard-faced Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icans, remained. Fennel faced them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fellows are in this, eh?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">jeered. "A bunch of traitors! Dupes!</seg><seg type="columnLine">If this scheme should succeed--which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't--you'll get paid in needles from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusian pistols. You ought to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. And if it fails, the pay-off will</seg><seg type="columnLine">take place right here on Earth. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you to gain ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plenty, fellow." A big, black-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">man grinned insolently. "We'll be taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of. None of us are worrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">about what's going to happen. We know!</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're handling the flagship! Bellon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Flan are both riding that. Naw!</seg><seg type="columnLine">We got nothing to worry about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, Greg!" Bellon smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">smugly. "You haven't a chance. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing is taken care of. And everybody.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even you." He stopped abruptly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had caught sight of the three Saturnian</seg><seg type="columnLine">apes for the first time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had finished eating. The three</seg><seg type="columnLine">were leaning back in their chairs view-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the drama with visible interest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were not the least bit fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened or embarrassed. Their only uneasi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, Greg knew, was due to the unac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed clothing all planetarians were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTEROID PIRATES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to don when they landed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flan grinned good-humoredly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems, Bellon," he said, "that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had better take care of our unexpected</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience. They have heard too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be left out of our plans now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bellon nodded and waddled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">booth. He addressed one of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you Saturnians know?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE APE looked up, baring his teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an engaging grin. Then he ignored</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venusian and'spoke rapidly to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions. The three gurgled happily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to think something extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant lay before them. They nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in agreement. The first again faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything, my dear Venusian. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly plain, is it not? All of Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at least a part of Mars are conspir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to steal the Asteroids from Earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since you spoke of taking gravity re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsors and amplifiers there, you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">intend to consolidate those small plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets into the large globe it once was. Am</seg><seg type="columnLine">I right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too right." Bellon's tone was decid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly unpleasant. "I don't know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">you figured it out from the little you</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard, but you have done so. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what that means?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Saturnian gurgled again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other two echoed the gurgle in an equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant manner. "Assuredly, Bellon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But you must not think our intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">too remarkable. You see, we Saturni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ans had the same idea several centuries</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, Earth time. But Earth was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploring the Asteroids so we felt she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a prior claim and gave up the idea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And what it means, my dear Bellon, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">this: You must either take us with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">or kill us. Am I right again?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are," Bellon declared em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phatically. "Possibly you could also ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vise me what to do about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I could." The ape nodded sagely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But you would not take my advice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bak, IJrg, and I have discussed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter fully. We think the same. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">must kill us, Bellon. Your only hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">for success lies in doing that immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately. Unless you do, we will thwart</seg><seg type="columnLine">your plans."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bellon sneered. Flan, evincing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare good humor common to his race,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned in appreciation of his partner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">discomfiture. The other four Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Americans did the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The assured manner of the Saturnians</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed Fennel favorably. He liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apes. Their facetiousness was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumed. They were absolutely with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out fear. If Bellon could be induced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare them, anything might be possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Monkeying with murder won't help</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Bellon," he warned. "Best leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">well enough alone. You've killed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">American. Our police will never forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. If Saturn's police take up your</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail also, you'll never escape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bak, the largest Saturnian, sat alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one side of the table. He threw back</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head and laughed uproariously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My dear Greg," he gasped, "pray, do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not intercede for us. If it is predestined</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we are to die from needle pistols,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shall be our fate." He released an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other outburst of laughter, then added,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I fear Jan spoke truly. Bellon</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not heed our advice. He will spare</seg><seg type="columnLine">us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bellon bristled. He knew he was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing baited. But he knew, also, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearlessness of the apes had excited the</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration of the Martians and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">American allies. He forced a smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Very true, my dear Bak. Your lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be spared, but you will honor us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your presence on the trip. Must I</seg><seg type="columnLine">add, as prisoners?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Bellon," Urg looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnestly, "you have not forgotten that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you cannot succeed while we live? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, it is foreordained that we block your</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans. My advice would be-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enough!" Bellon's patience was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">118</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an end. He turned to his two compatri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ots. "Search them. Search Greg Fen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel also. Make sure they have no weap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ons of any kind. You men," he ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed the Americans, "bring the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face cars to the back entry. We shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave for the airport immediately."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">GREG ALLOWED the sinuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms of one of the Venusians to travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his body. The needle pistol was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken. So were the two extra pellets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition. He even allowed his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual flyer to be lifted from his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders. He would have no use for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway. It wouldn't work once they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were out of Earth's atmosphere, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaceships would dive through that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Saturnians were greatly amused.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They offered no resistance, and nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of note was found on them. Not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle pistols. They wore the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">summer garments adopted by all Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">males and that varied only in color and</seg><seg type="columnLine">texture: trousers, sleeveless shirt, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket. Greg wondered where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have bought clothes large enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fit their enormous bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw their true size while they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being hurried along a wide corridor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of the building. They stooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward as they walked, but even then</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads towered above those of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians! Each must have weighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over eight hundred pounds. Yet there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something about their stealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements that told Fennel they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">act with the speed of light when the oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casion demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The surface cars were parked close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the building. Two were light trucks</seg><seg type="columnLine">with steel vault bodies. Money trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports. The rest were brand-new, glass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied passengers. The four-foot drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels in front were equipped with sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arate oxy-liydrogen motors, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass plow windbreaker told Greg they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were speedsters. Capable of five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flan boarded the first car. Two Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians, a Venusian, and an American got</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with him. A vault truck was next.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jan, the Saturnian, gurgled when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed him inside. Greg saw a light in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear of the segment rented by Harg,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian spy, and his partner in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether-phone business. Fie wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">call a warning but he knew the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sound-proof. Then he was hustled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the truck, and the vault door</seg><seg type="columnLine">clanged shut behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a joyful escapade!" Jan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly enjoying himself in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cramped quarters. "How happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bak and Urg must be!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They won't be so happy when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the Asteroids," Greg said, glumly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll be needled then!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear Greg," the ape said between</seg><seg type="columnLine">gurgles, "we Saturnians are needle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof. That is what amuses us so</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly. Our hides are very thick, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most puncture-proof. But the hair upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">our bodies is our real protection. Needles</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin. The hair winds about them tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stops them before any damage can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done. Is it not amusing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very," Fennel answered laconically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For you fellows."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, do not become disheartened."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jan hastened to reassure him. "Bak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urg and I shall certainly stay with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the very end. We intended that from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the start. Otherwise, we should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed the creatures bade in the In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terplanetary Restaurant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you had," Greg told him, "we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have saved the Asteroids then and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. We could have notified Harg of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Interplanetary Espionage and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planetary Federation would have taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ego, Greg. Yes, I am afraid it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ego that forced us to act as we did. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me explain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because we once planned to assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble the Asteroids, we Saturnians recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized what was taking place when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first collision occurred.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we can accomplish something spectac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular, something that will better condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions in our Solar System, we will win</seg><seg type="columnLine">the respect of you planetarians with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This happened. It seemed our</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. Can you blame us if we decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to act without notifying the P. F. or</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling for assistance? Bak, Urg, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came to Earth to begin operations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jan," Fennel found the Saturnian's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and squeezed it, "I'm with you!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm only a small cog in the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">Secret Police, but when I tell what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, you can be sure Earth will back</seg><seg type="columnLine">your planet to the limit!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well said, Greg.

The door was</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked open. Jan and Fennel backed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and slid to the ground. A huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpedo-shaped spaceship was before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DAY WAS BREAKING. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaceships had already taken off.

He motioned to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. One of his long arms reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and pulled a cushioned stool toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

Disregarding the difficulties aris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the daily rotation we then have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following situation:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Earth travels in its almost-circu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar orbit around the Sun at a speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">29.7 kilometers per second.

Inside the orbit of Earth travels</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus--naturally with a higher orbital</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, since it is nearer to the Sun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">has more gravitational attraction to</seg><seg type="columnLine">counterbalance. Mars travels outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit of Earth around the Sun, its speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">is less than that of Earth.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not even be deplorable, since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden stop would have changed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet into a mass of flaming wreckage</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway. If, however, even a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbital velocity were left, the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not fall directly into the Sun. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would move in an elliptical orbit, deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined by solar attraction and the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainder of orbital speed. The Earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit would change from a near-circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a long-drawn-out ellipse, with a peri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">helion close to the Sun. To the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings on Earth, from amoeba to man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a change of orbit might be ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastrophic, but the planet itself would</seg><seg type="columnLine">survive it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the orbital speed were reduced only</seg><seg type="columnLine">about ten per cent, the Earth would</seg><seg type="columnLine">start falling toward the Sun. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiral nearer to the central luminary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but while approaching the Sun, its speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">would increase like that of a falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, until a point and a speed were</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached that reestablished an equilibrium</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some new order. After some time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet would again have a stable</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit around the Sun--not the same as</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, but equally stable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the orbital speed of the planet were</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased, the opposite effect would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">place.

It may sound surprising, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, that an increase of orbital speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">would result in an orbit with lesser or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bital speed, but it is nevertheless true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">What can be done to the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet in theory can be done to a part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it in practice--if we are "skilled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the art." When we fire a gun vertically</seg><seg type="columnLine">at dusk or at dawn the shell--as seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Sun--undergoes a change of</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbital speed, either an increase or a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease. If the difference were only large</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, the shell might travel to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit of Mars (if its own speed added</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself to the orbital speed of Earth) or</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the orbit of Venus (if its speed sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted itself). And if the shot was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rightly timed--i. e., if the shell needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time to travel the distance be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the orbits as the moving targets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planets needed to arrive at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting place--the shell might even fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon one of these planets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We know nowadays--Ziolkovsky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oberth, Goddard and a lot of others</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught us that--that rockets are better</seg><seg type="columnLine">suited to obtain high velocities than</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells. Therefore spaceships and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket-ships have justly become synon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ymous, although one might imagine a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaceship that is not a rocket-ship, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one can certainly imagine a rocket-ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is not a spaceship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although some may try to imagine a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaceship that is not a rocket-ship, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only means to conquer space we know</seg><seg type="columnLine">of is by rockets. For this reason alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">the theory of interplanetary travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be based upon the laws of rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion. The first scientific calculation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this kind--made around the year 1900</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Russian school teacher Konstan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin E. Ziolkovsky--concerned a flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Moon--just the one case that</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens to be an exception from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Impossible and possible orbits to Venus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Orbit I is impossible, since when the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached Venus, planet and rocket would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be moving in opposite directions. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing, then, fuel would be needed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">halt the rocket's motion, then reverse it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bring it up to Venus' velocity. Or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit II is possible since rocket and planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">would meet traveling in the same direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion at nearly equivalent speeds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">general rule! Afterwards, the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested uninvestigated until in 1925 one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the construction engineers of the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Essen (Germany), Dr. Walter Hoh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mann, published a treatise that was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voted almost exclusively to the orbits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaceships. Dr. Hohmann did not treat</seg><seg type="columnLine">problems of construction or operation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his book; he merely stated his faith in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocket principle. Then he concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated his attention upon the astronom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical aspects of interplanetary travel. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the first things that occurred to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the realization that our Solar Sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem is fairly well suited for interplan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etary travel. All of its planets, and prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically all of its moons,- circle the Sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">in very nearly the same plane. And--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is even more important--all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets and the vast majority ef the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moons travel in the same direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If either of these facts were different</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hopes for interplanetary flights</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been destined to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes. One could never hope to land</seg><seg type="columnLine">128</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING SCIENCE-FICTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on a planet "Mars II" that traveled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its orbit just as real Mars does, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite direction. One could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly hope to reach a "Venus II" trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eling in an orbit the plane of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed an angle of 90° with the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the orbit of Earth. This is true be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause one cannot steer in space as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">can on Earth. On Earth, if an airplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishes to change its direction 180°--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn around completely--no power need</seg><seg type="columnLine">be expended. The fins are set at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle, and the necessary force is ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained by reaction with the air. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, fuel must be burned whenever a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change in direction is made. To turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">through 180°, as would be necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach "Mars II," fuel enough would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed to overcome Earth's orbital</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, plus fuel to match the orbital</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of "Mars II," plus the fuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed to climb out the 50,000,000 miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so against solar gravity. To reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hypothetical "Venus II," a turn in</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of 90° must be made. Curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, the spaceship which cannot travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a straight line, cannot curve its course</seg><seg type="columnLine">by its own volition either! Or, at least,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot economically do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Things being as they are, interplan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etary travel is within the bounds of rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. The problem becomes solvable if</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful rocket motors and applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomical mathematics are used as</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools. Now, in 1938, it remains to build</seg><seg type="columnLine">better rocket motors.

An</seg><seg type="columnLine">example of this method of division might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be interesting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the ship is bound for Mars, it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">to increase the speed it has with refer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ence to the Sun as part of the Earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hohmann wanted it to take off from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet in the general direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sun and to attain a distance of about</seg><seg type="columnLine">800,000 kilometers from the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earth. Although this distance is</seg><seg type="columnLine">small as astronomical distances go, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would practically eliminate the attrac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the Earth. Hohmann wanted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship to go sunward first only for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose of having the planet (Earth)</seg><seg type="columnLine">always fully illuminated so that mistakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be easily checked. According to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Hohmann's calculations, the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned would be attained in about 15</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. At the end of this time it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have separated from the Earth, but seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Sun it would still travel with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orbital speed of Earth. In short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship would be a small part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, separate and independent, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">still behaving exactly like the planet it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this is accomplished, the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors woidd have to resume work to</seg><seg type="columnLine">"disturb" the orbit in such a way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new orbit that would be created</seg><seg type="columnLine">would extend between the orbits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth and Mars. It would be an ellipse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fairly high eccentricity, just touching</seg><seg type="columnLine">both orbits on either end, but not cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them. A few days later, some cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rections of the orbit might have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made, and then there would be no work</seg><seg type="columnLine">left for the pilot except waiting till the</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit of Mars is reached.

They praised it for its pioneering</seg><seg type="columnLine">value and for its simplicity; criticized</seg><seg type="columnLine">it because it is not the optimal solution</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the problem. Professor Oberth's im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">provement of the method has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">termed "the problem of condensation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">powered flight". It is true that firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rockets three times looks a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">amateurish if the three necessary changes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in velocity can be attained in one sweep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is also true that a considerable amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fuel can be saved if all necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed changes are compressed into one</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation. The reason for this saving</seg><seg type="columnLine">has to be sought mainly in the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocket motors would work with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower efficiency in the second and third</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing because of the lower speed of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. If all three changes are accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished together, the ship has generally</seg><seg type="columnLine">a higher speed and therefore the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors have a higher efficiency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a matter of fact, Hohmann men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned later that he is in favor of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">densing the period of powered flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. There are cases, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it would be advisable not to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense, because several periods of firing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would prove advantageous. Such a case</seg><seg type="columnLine">would present itself if the ship had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave one of the moons of Jupiter. Ju-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piter's bulk could be used to assist the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket motors of the ship.

The B, C, D, etc.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbits are obtained with changes of or-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bital speed and direction. Since all</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbits are elliptical--although only part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ellipse is actually traveled--one</seg><seg type="columnLine">can also say that an ellipse that touches</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orbits of the planets of departure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of arrival is an A orbit, while an ellipse</seg><seg type="columnLine">that crosses the orbits of the planets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure and of arrival belongs to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other classes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The A orbits are inexpensive, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a long time.

In the case of a trip to Venus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time of waiting would be 470 days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the entire trip would take 146</seg><seg type="columnLine">plus 470 plus 146 = 762 days.

Professor Hermann Oberth, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his very first publication, devoted much</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and space to prove that this cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naturally," he wrote, "manned space</seg><seg type="columnLine">rockets are not supposed to descend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth in a straight line, because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparative shortness of the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the air is dense enough to brake</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fall. Since a manned rocket has</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sideward motion at any event,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially when the departure did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">take place vertically, the rocket ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaches Earth on a curve of the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">order that can easily be influenced in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a way that the point nearest (the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of) Earth is situated in the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere of the planet. Even if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">assume that the layer where the para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chute can be safely and effectively used</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not thicker than 4-5 miles (higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the air is too thin, farther below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">health of the passengers will be en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangered by too rapid deceleration), and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if the rocket approaches Earth in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">parabolic orbit the 'braking way' is</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than 800 kilometers long (840</seg><seg type="columnLine">km.).

Since</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Earth has an atmosphere, one is forced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to travel the first ten or fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles practically vertical in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrate the densest layers of the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere as quickly as possible. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">then one can start to tilt the orbit of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture until it finally runs parallel with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the planet, although far</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough from it not to be handicapped by</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmospheric friction. Professor Oberth</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully computed the optimal curve of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascent which gives the highest results at</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowest cost and termed it the "curve of</seg><seg type="columnLine">synergy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus we have for the take-off a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"curve of synergy," starting from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of a high mountain.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is another gain possible; the speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earth's rotation. If the curve of</seg><seg type="columnLine">synergy faces toward east, the speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth's rotation is with the ship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not against it as it would be if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve faced west. And since the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rotation is highest at the equator--</seg><seg type="columnLine">some 500 yards per second--the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain should be located in the very midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tropical zone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Strangely enough, there is actually a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mountain in existence that fulfills most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the conditions for an ideal spaceport.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It is Mt.

He continued, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes blazing as he warmed to his theme.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As man to man, none of us has</seg><seg type="columnLine">any quarrel with the European. You--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">--all of us--are but transplanted Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peans. The European outside of Eu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope is not a predatory creature, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even quarrelsome. In the building of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old United States we saw millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them of every Old World creed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nationality live and work peaceably to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. Our race today is a blend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Yet all the while their cousins</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the water were butchering each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other on account of age-old prejudices.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every one of the important old-time</seg><seg type="columnLine">capitals of Europe is haunted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory of a day when it almost ruled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world, and the ruler who sits in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those thrones sooner or later acquires</seg><seg type="columnLine">the obsession that he, too, is destined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">control a great empire. My contention</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that that evil heritage is local, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">racial. We must deal with a ghost, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a people, a megalomania rising from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood-soaked soil of a continent</seg><seg type="columnLine">with loo much tradition! I propose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen, that in the interest of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">humanity, we make ready to force the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandonment of Europe!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down among the excited buzz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the council. No more extraordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary view had ever been seriously stated</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them. The Chief Commissioner</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as astonished as any other member</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the group. For many years he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in more or less close association</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the staid scientist and knew him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be indefatigable, resourceful, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant, in his silent way. But tonight</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had spoken with passion, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arraignment of the inanimate continent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of Europe was as unexpected as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposal to depopulate it. Yet, in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, Dr. Barn/s had offered programs</seg><seg type="columnLine">that at the time seemed ■ too fantastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a sane man's consideration. To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, many of these were functioning as</seg><seg type="columnLine">commonplace details of a highly techni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal civilization. The Chief thought best</seg><seg type="columnLine">to approach this new idea with cautious</seg><seg type="columnLine">open-mindedness. With a trace of irony</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his voice, he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dr. Barnes, for the past many years</seg><seg type="columnLine">your organization has been working day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and night ostensibly to help us defend</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves from these raiders from Eu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope. If you knew a way to render that</seg><seg type="columnLine">continent uninhabitable at a single stroke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I deplore your reticence in keeping it</seg><seg type="columnLine">a secret while we were wasting men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships in futile and costly nibbling at it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because," replied Dr. Barnes, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignity, "time and equipment were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">available. Such a stroke will require</seg><seg type="columnLine">elaborate preparations. Furthermore, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequences will be so grave that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be invoked only by those mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men themselves. Now, we may pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pare it secretly, as a purely defensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure. If they keep the peace, it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not come into operation. But should</seg><seg type="columnLine">they violate the treaties with a sudden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicious raid--as they have done on every</seg><seg type="columnLine">other previous occasion--that very act</seg><seg type="columnLine">will set their doom in motion. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">calamities that will thereafter befall them</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be virtually self-inflicted. Our na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional conscience will be free of guilt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These words gave promise of some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing more tangible. The Chief Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missioner cared little for any theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Europeans, but as a weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">and experienced director of relentless</seg><seg type="columnLine">warfare he saw here the promise of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other weapon. If there could be such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">one powerful enough to destroy a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinent at a single operation, he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know of it. That war was certain to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be resumed, he had no doubt. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be the deciding factor. He in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">EVICTION BY ISOTHERM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">137</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vited Dr. Barnes-to reveal the details of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hearings Required Several days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Barnes successively introduced his</seg><seg type="columnLine">two technical assistants in the plan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Stanley, of the meteorological bu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reau, and Professor Stevens, the vul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canologist. It was Stanley's painstak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing report that formed the basis for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussions. The bulky portfolio, bulg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with maps, was marked "Plan M-4",</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only title by which it was afterward</seg><seg type="columnLine">made known to the world. Eventually</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry Thatcher, Director of Construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, was called in for estimates and</seg><seg type="columnLine">budget requirements. It was soon ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent that the figures involved were</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal and that ten years was hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough for what was to be done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chief Commissioner whistled</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he examined the program. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides all this, he must rebuild the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleets and rehabilitate the army. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hundreds of ruined cities to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaned up and reconstructed. Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bined, these activities would tax the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical and manufacturing resources</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hemisphere to the utmost. Pie</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that prudence required that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eurasiatics be met with the tried and</seg><seg type="columnLine">proven old weapons as well as the new.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet this new idea appealed to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was breath-taking in its boldness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its simplicity. But--would it work?</seg><seg type="columnLine">A week of heated day and night session</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the council brought the decision. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to work. Nothing else promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a long, drawn-out continu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of the old struggle. Experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taught them that the most hopeful</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of that would be another truce of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaustion. The project was authorized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> HENRY THATCHER stood on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">summit of a low peak some thirty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the westward of Mt. Iraza, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cordillera de Salamanca, watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">action of two of his giant "moles" on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach below him. The Caribbean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">once ninety miles distant at this point,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">now lapped the shore not five miles from</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he was standing.

They were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of three or four miles apart, eat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their way into the land that had once</seg><seg type="columnLine">been Costa Rica. Each of them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred feet in length and corre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spondingly thick. From its seaward side</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge suction hose dipped into the sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other a massive tube of metal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than fifty feet in diameter, led</seg><seg type="columnLine">away over the land to the north. Fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing the tubes with his high-power</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses, Thatcher lost them in the haze</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the distant horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crunch of approaching footsteps</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused Thatcher to lower his glasses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Barnes and Stanley came up to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and exchanged greetings. He was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting them, as they had notified him</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few days before that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">making one of their frequent inspection</seg><seg type="columnLine">trips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How are the 'moles' behaving,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Dr. Barnes, "since you started</seg><seg type="columnLine">using the new solvent?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great!" exclaimed Thatcher.

Here, the waves broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the foot of the mountain. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">this side the work was finished. Over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the southwest the watery horizon lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately where the shore line and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some towns used to be.

Dr. Barnes regarded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glassy run of congealed fused rock with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a face set grimly. Here was another</seg><seg type="columnLine">memento of some skirmish of the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In this place, probably, a swooping Eu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasiatic had overshot his prey and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazzling lance had slashed against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inert peak below. Of all the areas, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">isthmus, from Honduras to Colombia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the most incessantly ravaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the invaders.

BARNES WAS well satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the progress. In these seven years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thatcher and the Panamerican construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion crews had accomplished marvels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The clumsy "moles", in spite of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncouth appearance, were uncannily effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient in their task of dredging away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower flanks of the isthmus. This vora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious implement, an invention of Thatch-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">er's, softened bedrock by impregnating</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with a solvent mixed in sea-water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then ground it to a paste within its vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brating interior. When fine enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more water was added, and the resultant</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixture was ejected into the waste tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">that carried it hundreds of miles north</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the dumping ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In each of the successive wars, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eurasiatics had first of all struck at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canals of Panama and Nicaragua. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thatcher had come to the isthmus after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the armistice, he found two mangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditches that must be cleaned out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened and rebuilt. This task was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trifling one compared to the larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">order of Plan M-4, which called for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowing of the isthmus to leave noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but the crooked backbone of the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tral range of the Cordillera. Thatcher</seg><seg type="columnLine">was faced with the problem of remov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all the shoulders and the plains from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northern canal, eastward to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighty-second meridian, leaving in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">place deep water. It was for this tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous job that he had devised the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"moles".</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty of them had been built and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put to the relatively easy task of clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing away the Pacific side--easier, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause there was less of it, and the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved earth could be spilled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-by deep water. There, the thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand-fathom curve was close to shore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But on the Caribbean side, Barnes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stanley had ordered the earth conveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">far north to where the easternmost cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of Honduras made a cape. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced the lengthening of the huge spill</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes and the interposition of a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of booster pumping stations. It was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a look at the made land at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dump that led the inspecting party to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave its vantage point and go down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope a few hundred yards to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">their reconnaissance cruiser awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This machine was of the counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity type, a thing of beauty in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate control, silent and smooth in op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">EVICTION BY ISOTHERM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">139</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eration, and ideally adapted for hover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. As they soared away into the north,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping low so that they could observe</seg><seg type="columnLine">the encroachment of the scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">"moles" strung out along the shore line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barnes sat in the rear compartment with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chief constructor and silently ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined the terrain flowing by beneath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A long string of buildings on the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainside soon came into view.

There actually was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no such metal, but the imaginary prop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erties ascribed it were so marvellous</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it served nicely to explain the mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitude of the mining operations in Cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tral America.

Blizzard had piled on top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blizzard. North of the Alps, every val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley was already filled with snow drifts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Baltic soon froze and took on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of the Arctic Ocean.

Soon they be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to die in increasing numbers as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled desperately through the drifts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the icy blasts seeking the warmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the Americas it was somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">colder than usual, but thanks to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warnings and careful preparations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their government, there was little real</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering. The country dug in and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best of a hard winter.

Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures caught in the bight of a wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">being drawn taut, the peoples of Europe</seg><seg type="columnLine">were relentlessly being shoved out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their homelands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some stayed, tearing down the houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of frozen or fleeing neighbors for fuel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring would soon come and the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter would be gone. But spring did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not come. Nor summer. The myriad</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons--cubic miles--of volcanic dust in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high heavens intensified all woes by</seg><seg type="columnLine">filtering out a large proportion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incoming sunlight.

The circulation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winds had drastically changed. The pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vailing ones were now from the north,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as the flow of heat formerly con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducted by the Gulf Stream from equa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torial regions to the Arctic was checked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temperature gradient between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two zones steepened.

Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land was to become another Labrador,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scandinavia an eastern counterpart of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greenland. But what puzzled Krevin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky was the suddenness of the glacia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Such a profound change could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly come so quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While he was pondering this enigma,</seg><seg type="columnLine">further dismay was created in Jerusalem</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the receipt of a curt notice from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hang-Chow, regional capital of the Ori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ental division, that the yellow race had</seg><seg type="columnLine">asserted its independence of the Eurasi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atic confederation. More and more in</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent years they had come under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">domination of the pacifistic Chinese.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asia now, as well as ice-bound Europe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lost to the grasping dictator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zandorff, the director, recognizing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">temporary inability to do anything but</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept the secession, turned his atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion once more to the situation in Eu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope. There had been other severe win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters ; this one would pass. He sent for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Krevinsky, and demanded sternly for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long range forecast. He wanted to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the government could move back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Vienna.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But by that time Krevinsky had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned of the two volcanic eruptions</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost coincident with the great blast at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the isthmus. Previously, his technicians</seg><seg type="columnLine">had interpreted the recorded tremors as</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicative of the delayed portions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">isthmian blast. Now he knew the worst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excellency," he said, "hereafter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winters of Europe will all be cold. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gulf Stream has ceased, and with it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iceland 'low'. If that were all, the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinent would be uncomfortable, but much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it habitable. But in addition to that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will have no summers, and far more</seg><seg type="columnLine">severe winters, until the dust of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous volcanic eruptions settles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That condition prevails over the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should that make a difference?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped Zandorff, impatiently.

His pass was in order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the soldier nodded and waved him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. A long, broad road stretched into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue distance through wooded hills,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Carver turned aside into the scanty</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest. Occasionally he cast a furtive</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance behind him, but, though autocars</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed along the road and one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">aircraft droned overhead toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing-fields on the City's roof, no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid heed to the Helot. It was good</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychology to let the workers do as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished during their free hours. Always</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided that they did not interfere with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pleasure of the Lords.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside the City the wind was cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chilling, yet Carver drank it in hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grily, his face bare to the refreshing</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasts. Out here a man could feel some</seg><seg type="columnLine">illusion of a freedom which had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">really existed in America, or in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, for hundreds of years. To be</seg><seg type="columnLine">free one must have in his veins the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainted blood of the Lords, the racial</seg><seg type="columnLine">purity that gave them license to rule</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth. Other races were inferior by</seg><seg type="columnLine">law of conquest and by decree of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lords, who held their power over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed stocks of America, as ages ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">Americans had enslaved the Negroes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The guards were recruited from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranks of the Lords, each youth serving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brief military apprenticeship. And un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the oligarchy sweated and labored</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Helots, their birth-rate limited, hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less and impotent, their criminals</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed to being hunted down by wolf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hounds for the sport of the despots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carver could not understand the so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial forces that had inevitably led to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an end ; he simply toiled and hated, one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a million robots working amid the slim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">graceful forms of the overbred Lords.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he trudged through the forest, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground strange to his sandaled feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were more used to the rubbery</seg><seg type="columnLine">pavements of the City corridors. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">he glanced up at an unfamiliar shrilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air, and saw a gigantic silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpedolike craft drift down till it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden by a wooded bridge. The Ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning from its voyage toward Mars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Briefly he wondered what had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong in space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> BUT THE SHIP wras forgotten as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a little cave beside a brook, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw an old man, gnarled and shrunken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting in the sunlight.

A bitter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry sob shook Carver's thick body.

The Ship had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. And the crew were frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and puzzled. Something had stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in space--some force they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand. They had returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, but not under their own power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to comprehend what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So much the talcs said, furtively mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mured among the Helots. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curious air of unrest in the City when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carver slipped out that night, and, walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing swiftly along the road in the twi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, unaccustomed thoughts stirred in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fnrnd. Apparently the Lords were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not omnipotent. They could be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feated. But--Carver smiled bitterly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not by Helots. Not by unarmed slaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly he stiffened. A familiar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">figure was coming toward him, vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the distance. With a cold shock he</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized his father, and saw that two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men--guards !--were moving swiftly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ardno's direction. Blindly the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked, gnarled hands outstretched fum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blingly, his feet guided by the hard sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" Carver tried to shout. "Go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back! Back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow he knew why Ardno was</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. The old man had come to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">death that would release himself and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">son from an existence that had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">intolerable. No longer would Carver</seg><seg type="columnLine">need to risk torture by smuggling food</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his father. And, for Ardno, blind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and agony would be over. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carver raced on, a part of his brain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying, over and over, "This is best.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's the best way out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The affair was finished before Carver</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the group. Ardno was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead, a limp, misshapen huddle beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, and the two guards were sheath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their guns. One of the soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to face him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well? What d'you want, Helot?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ever after that Carver was to remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber how the sinking sun glowed redlv</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the two men, outlining their slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures with a hazy aura. And he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered, too, the silhouette of an arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming up, a gun gripped in a slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. Strangely he felt no emotion;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seemed to be outside his body, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it dispassionately, listening to its-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse breathing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If he said the wrong thing--if he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed his relationship to Ardno--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would mean perhaps death, at least tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. Carver hesitated. His great</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders shook as he fought for air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a throat dry and clamped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the guards said something in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an undertone. The other nodded, moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, his weapon's muzzle not a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Carver's chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Helot--back to the City!

And beyond it he saw, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most at his feet, the blind staring eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ardno.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Helot, Carver roared--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful engine that was his body swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">into action. One huge hand drove down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasped the gun and wrenched it free.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He scarcely heard the report or felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet tear along his palm. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but the startled white face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard, and beyond it the other man</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing his weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's mad!" the disarmed soldier</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried, and screamed in agony as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun's butt smashed into his face, pulp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its delicate features in bloody ruin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He staggered away, still shrieking, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carver lunged at the other man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bullet hit the Helot's side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced off his ribs. But that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stop Carver. Without glancing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bellowing gun he came forward like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drive of a piston, and his fist cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleanly against the soldier's chin. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man went back bonelessly and dropped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head twisted at an impossible angle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE OTHER GUARD lay limp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious. Breathing harshly, Carver</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared around. Cars were approaching.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Helot's side hurt. He touched it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was surprised by the amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood that smeared his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Insensate rage mounted within</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carver, and he stood with his fists</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched, facing the City. This will</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean death, he thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And a new mate for Morna-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The realization stabbed his brain. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips moved wordlessly. He turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran toward the forest, and behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a fusillade of shots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the woods a man came to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">him--such a man as he had never seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. Ten feet high, moving with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lithe, unhurried swiftness, he was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carver's side before the Helot had cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered three yards. Carver growled an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oath, lunged at this new enemy, teeth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bared in a snarl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And without warning came--the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">explicable. Around the two there lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wall of cold flame, crackling softly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it grew and came together fifteen feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the ground to form a dome. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood within a little hut of fire, spring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing apparently from the Earth itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fear shook Carver. But in the new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comer he saw only menace, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped forward-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And halted. Some incredible force</seg><seg type="columnLine">held him motionless, draining his mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles of power, holding him paralyzed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood fighting against invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds, glaring at the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was utterly silent, save for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint crackling of the flame-wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Against the pale glow loomed the gi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gantic figure, and now Carver realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was not looking upon a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For this man was cast in human mold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet about him was an air of alienage--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a calm and passionless withdrawal in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pale eyes--that told more than did</seg><seg type="columnLine">his abnormal height. He wore a scanty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleevelss robe, and his muscles beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">ivory skin were those of a colossus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somehow the fear and hatred in Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver's mind faded and fled away as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked into the wise, ancient eyes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant and read in them a message.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not hear it, but words seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to form within his brain, unmistakable</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though spoken by an audible voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It said softly, "I will not harm you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the dome of fire above, a flam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tendril dropped straight for Carver's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.

To Carver it was as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lay naked before the eyes of a god.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sensed some incredible communion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flood of knowledge pouring from him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into--what ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sensation vanished. The finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light was gone.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to look through them into an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The huge man seemed to listen.

It was an excellent story,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">both from the standpoint of the characteriza-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions and the incidental science--a good example</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the latter being the episode of the vault open-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing by the glassmen. And the description of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gamble's "perfect civilization"! That was u</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">real laugh. McClary's style is far better than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the average, and he deals with the human ele-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment, and the reactions of people to their en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vironment, in a way that I have seldom seen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">surpassed. He produced not only a science-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fiction yarn, but a piece of real literature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">More !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I'd like to comment on all the stories, but I'm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">afraid the postage for the resultant 4ns. would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">require postage beyond my present means. How-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever, a few need something said about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For instance, Manly Wade Wellman's "Men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Against the Stars". There was realism mixed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in with an understanding of the spirit of ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ploration, the onward drive in men--whatever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it is--and the ability to tell a fast moving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yarn. The mixture producing a story that tied</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for first place in the issue. The other top-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">notcher was "Below--Absolute", which treated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a not altogether new idea in a novel manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">However, this "negative space" business is in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">danger of becoming overworked ; it has been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">used quite a bit of late. It might be a good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">idea to give it a rest. Another good tale was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Seeds of the Dusk". The idea of an organism</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">being able to develop a science by introspection</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is a new one to me, and it was presented most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">convincingly here. Gallun seems to be a con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sistently good writer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I wish the same could be said of Wesso as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an artist. He did good work on the June cover</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--in fact, it was the best one since March. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his interior work was an immense improvement</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over that of the past few issues--especially the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">illustration for Wellman's story. Schneeman (lid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a good illustration--the second one---for "The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Legion of Time". And apropos Schneeman,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">let's have more of his cover illustrations; the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one for the May number was tine. I have one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fault to find with Binder : liis drawings are too</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">obviously sketches. That is. he leaves too much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white, unshaded space in his work. As for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Brown--please coniine bis efforts to the cover;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lie does very well there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Speaking of illustrations, it seems to me that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the drawing or picture accompanying the story</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lias a great influence on the impression which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that story leaves in the reader's mind. I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">read yarns that impressed me greatly, and yet,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">after analyzing them closely, I have decided tliat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the illustrations--in each instance imaginative</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and well executed--have been just as responsible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the effect. It was the realizatim of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spirit of file story that did it--the visible pres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entation of tho writer's idea. And. conversely,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rotten illustrations have spoiled perfectly good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stories for me. Perhaps the reason that Dold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is well liked is that, although his technique is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">none too good, his imagination and his ability</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to sense the effect which the author wished to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">produce enable him to produce appropriate draw-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ings. And that's one reason I don't like Thom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">son's work--he apparently has no great im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">agination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mr. Avery wonders if the readers are in fa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vor of the new regime. Indeed, he appears quite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sceptical. "Who asked for the mutants?" says</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he. "Why don't we see the type of letters they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">used to write in the good ol' days?" (Wonder if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it could possibly be that not so many of them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are written?) Well.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">gibbous Mars with the shaded portion just barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen against the dark background would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been much more startling and effective.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 would also like to make my suggestion for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next mutant cover. (Everybody seems to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">advising you ou that point, so I may as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">contribute my two cents.) It is generally con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceded by one and all that the most beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">object in the Solar System is Saturn, and conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently it would seem that a cover showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the famous rings- as seen from Saturn's surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be quite distinctive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now about the stories. There seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a dearth of the longer stories. Your "novel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ettes" are often only a page or two longer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the short stories. This is unfortunate as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long complete story (ills an indispensable cavity</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the scheme of things.
