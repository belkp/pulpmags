                <seg type="columnLine"> Prance wakes one morning horrified to witness the destruction of one of her prized battleships, La</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Liberte, in the harbor of Toulon. Her powder magazines had exploded in some unaccountable manner,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">entirely wrecking the vessel and killing three hundred of her crew. There is some baffling mystery as to</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">the cause of the catastrophe, and three of the greatest brains in France are set on solving it--Delcasse,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">the powerful minister of the marine; Lepine, head of the detective bureau; and Crochard the Invincible, a</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">wonderful character and leader of the underworld. Crochard soon proves himself the master of affairs.</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Singular things come to light. First, two men, apparently foreigners, were seen at sunrise staring at La</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Liberte just as the ship blew up, then they disappeared. All their actions proved suspicious, but the</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">authorities cannot place hands on them. Deductions lead to the conviction that they were German naval</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">officers in disguise. Again, wireless telegraphy seems to have played an important role in the
                    destruction</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">of La Liberte. But how, and from whence? Delcasse and his allies are at a loss, when a most disquieting</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">and significant discovery is made: Crochard finds a secret wireless station hidden in a grove on a
                    neighbor-</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">ing hill. Further investigation confirms the worst fears--the two foreigners are identified as. Germans,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">one of them undoubtedly Pachmann, head of the German wireless service. Crochard strikes another</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">mysterious trail leading him to suspect and follow the fleeing footsteps of Vard, a Polish exile, and his</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">daughter Kasia, bound for America on the liner Prinzessin Ottilie. Lepine sends an aerogram to the</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">commander of the speeding ship, asking him if Vard and daughter are on board, but the answer denies</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">knowledge of them. The French authorities are nonplused. Meanwhile, on board the Ottilie, Vard and</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Kasia are journeying in safety. Kasia meets an attractive, frank young American, Dan Webster, and</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">takes him into her confidence. She tells him that her father is the most wonderful man in the world, and</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">holds the destinies of nations in the hollow of his hand. Dan is duly impressed, but receives a momentary</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">shock when he discovers that their conversation on the dark deck has been overheard by his roommate,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Chevrial, an alleged wine merchant, who warns Webster that it is dangerous to hold such conversations--</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">spies are about. Aboard, also, are Pachmann and a German prince, their mission being with Vard, who</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">holds the secret of destroying navies by ether waves. It is Pachmann who "doctors" the wireless message</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">to Lepine. Kasia, growing more friendly with Dan, gives into his charge the great device of her father's,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">the Vards being fearful of treachery. Meanwhile, Pachmann and Vard hold guarded conference about the</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">invention and its ultimate use. But it is soon apparent that their talk has been overheard by some spy,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">and Pachmann is distraught.</seg>

                <seg type="columnLine">ance with a young chap whom she had met in the recent social whirl. Uncertain of his name, she calls</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">him "Mr. Bowles," and he accepts this cognomen though it irritates her. He informs her that her tales of</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">the Far West have inspired this trip of his, and that he is bound for Los Angeles. Dixie, contemptuous of</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">this "suede New Yorker," loada him up with wild stories of ranch life. When she bids him farewell at</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Albuquerque, the Western girl is fairly choking with laughter at Bowles' gullibility. But her gayety</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">changes to sudden gravity at finding him upon Chula Vista station. It means that he has deliberately</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">followed her. Dixie May promptly gives him his conge. But Alias Bowles is not to be dismayed. After</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">a week's training in Chula Vista he rides over to the Money Bug Ranch and applies for a job as cowboy.</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">The father of Dixie receives him curtly, and tells him that he cannot take him on under any circumstance.</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Unabashed, Alias Bowles insists, persists, until Henry Lee is nettled and engages him on the promise that</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">he will prove himself by riding a notorious man-killing horse. Though this agreement is not carried out,</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Alias Bowles suffers much under the hazing given him by his cowboy companions, who are led by Hardy
                    Atkins,</seg>

                    he</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">sticks and is game. Gradually, however, Alias Bowles wins favor with Dixie and makes a comrade of</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">Brigham Clark, one of the cow-punchers. Mrs. Lee evinces great interest in the new hand but grows sus-</seg>

                <seg type="columnLine">speak her thoughts. There was no</seg>

                <seg type="columnLine">was gone, and he was reaping his just</seg>
