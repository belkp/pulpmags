            <seg type="columnLine">Then a great idea came to him, and he arranged with Mr. Singer, in charge of the fete, to raffle his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">from New York, and told him that the tailor would sue at once if Henry did not pay him that</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was threat in that tone. Henry</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">glanced at its owner, and then, for a time,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gazed at the smoking, crackling heap that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">have expected that panic would have seized</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upon him, and that, taking one or two of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">No panic came, however, or any sign of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">panic. That part of Henry's brain which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could feel an emotion so trivial as terror</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was temporarily benumbed, but the ability</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This bright thought came to Henry at</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A quick, hot flush came to Henry's cheek</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Lean to a degree, hooked of nose, with a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">for him, but it was inevitably a definite and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Still, he could not well live through two</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was Plant's low purpose to play upon his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" You're here to work, and, by gad.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Have you got that pavement washed?</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">All right. Take back the pail and the mop</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the day's supply. I'll see that you do it!"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He bounced to his feet and slapped the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Viciously, too, did he follow upon Henry's</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">tatingly, to the garage and then to the ice-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">house. Viciously he smiled as Henry's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">powerful arms swung out a cake; and he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ordered Henry to put it aside and go on</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So that Henry, ever humming, tugged</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was not the work itself, of course;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it was the idea of Joe Plant standing there</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">At some remote antebellum time the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">abuse he insisted on a little more speed,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">too, and suggested that Henry possibly was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not strong enough for his job, after all,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">causing Henry to pause again and then drag</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The sun was high when he had finished.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">In the nature of things Plant would have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to pause for luncheon pretty soon; but it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seemed that he had no idea of permitting</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" That's a fair enough job, Baird," he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">with a laugh, but he was beginning to doubt</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Henry paused at the hedge and laughed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wildly. His teeth were grinding like mill-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">off the laugh and glared at the hedge as if</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sider myself a sexual freak! But my health</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was delicate in my youth, and my habits</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">secluded and studious. My father died</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when I was a child, and my mother, Joan,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and I lived in a place somewhat removed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from ordinary social access. I loved, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">love, beauty, feminine or other, but as a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spectator. I can feel the allurement of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">woman in poetry and art, but I was never</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">subject to any personal attraction to in-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Therefore, upon the whole, I should hold</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">die; she was a spirit, and for the sake of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the spirit I was willing to forego the flesh,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">since it is the spirit that true-lovers love,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had been her husband? He couldn't be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">L. H.; and the intervention of L. H. pre-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sented still another problem.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">* I remembered, however, that in the early</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">part of the nineteenth century the title of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mrs. was often borne by unmarried wo-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">men, especially on the stage--and, for that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">matter, Asgard might have been merely a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stage name. But if (as I was disposed to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">believe) there was a husband, he could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hardly have been with her in London--his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">presence there would not have been com-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">patible with that of L. H. She and her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">husband must then have separated, she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">retaining, for professional purposes, her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">married name. That she was a widow did</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not seem probable, for in that case why</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shouldn't L. H. have married her? True,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he also might have been already married;'</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but at this point I dismissed the specula-:</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion, perceiving that it was the identity of</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It concerned me because the hand that'</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">been the hand of her lover, and of her ac-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cepted lover, too; and that was a hundred</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">years ago! The reason I had failed to con-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">how could her spirit, which had loved him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">while she was still in the body, now adapt</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">thither before the princess, and even then</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">open the door of the tiring-room, and saw</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">WHEN Owen Vaughn, celebrated New York detective, accepted the invitation of his friend and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">coworker, Margot Dale, to attend Mrs. John Bashford Whymper's musicale, where the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">musical sensation of the season, Seiiorita Dolores Arsenjo, was to play her violin, he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">looked forward to an evening of pleasure unmixed with business.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At the close of the concert, while Margot listened to the raptures of young Lieutenant Bate-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">son, and the audience seemed to have been swept off its feet by the weird effect of the final num-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ber, a prized possession of the hostess, a costly Chinese vase, was suddenly discovered to have been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thrown to the floor and shattered.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On examining one of the broken bits Vaughn found it was not the original vase, which he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knew well, but a clever reproduction. Moreover, he also learned that Senor Jose Arsenjo, who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arranged his daughter's concerts, had particularly stipulated where the vase was to be placed, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">night of the concert, asserting his daughter's playing was subtly influenced by the atmosphere</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">imparted by a work of art. Vaughn's professional curiosity was at once aroused. Mrs. Whymper</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">secured an invitation to an Arsenjo recital at the home of Mrs. Foulkes, which Vaughn attended in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">disguise. Here he found that an atmospheric " prop," a genuine Blakelock, disappeared at the final</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">number of the concert, and a clever fake had been substituted for the original. Vaughn found the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">paint of the signature was still wet. A suspicious box of flowers for the artist gave the detective his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lead. Bateson had again been present, and when her accompanist was taken ill, Bateson played</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for Seiiorita Arsenjo. It was evident the young American had fallen for Dolores Arsenjo.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At the next Arsenjo concert, at the home of his friend, Dr. Durant, Vaughn secured a place of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">advantage in a small room which communicated with the drawing-room. The detective learned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that just before the mysterious final number, Arsenjo, by means of a miniature atomizer, dis-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">charged some subtle gas over the heads of the audience, This was the famous " spell," which all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but robbed the audience of consciousness, and which invariably made Dolores Arsenjo faint at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">end of the evening. Next he saw Miguel, the Ecuadorian's factotum, take down the three Henners,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">valued at fifty thousand dollars, which he replaced with three copies.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Hardly had his man disappeared with the pictures when Arsenjo reappeared and announced</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that his daughter's priceless Stradivarius had been stolen; and he suspected Bateson. In fact he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">went to Vaughn the next day and engaged him on the case, with the suggestion if the detective</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were to search the lieutenant's rooms, he thought the violin would be found.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">he had followed the Spaniard to a house on Staten Island, where he had left a parcel which was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about the size of the Blakelock painting. In the midst of the detective's calculations, Seiiorita</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">would be Miere, and, if so, he hoped that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they would not recognize him. His name</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">misgiving that he entered the waiting car,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">seemed so cold, so distant, to Twoomey as it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">did now. Heretofore he was the most ardent</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">quiet, wanted to get away from it all--from</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">What caused this discontent he could not</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then the Sport knew what was the mat-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">There was more to life than merely being</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">thing I knew I was streaking toward that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wharf where the Sultan's barge had been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tied up. I knew that Candelario had taken</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Traddle and had gone after Buck and Miss</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Graves; so I reckoned our best plan would</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that the barge was not there at all. Mani-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">festly, Candelario had taken it, or maybe</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Buck had done so. There was no time to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the Malays from the palace would be along</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">after us, so I yanked the horse's head</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">around and turned him into the path that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">went to the Malay village, a few rods far-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ther down the bank. He was slowing down</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by this time, so when we reached the vil-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lage I stopped him and slid off.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Everything was dark and quiet among</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the thatched houses, and I did not bother</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">waking any one up, but hoofed it for the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shore of the river, going as quietly as I</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">could. Some dogs barked, but there was no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">other disturbance. If any one saw me in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">my Malay dress, they would perhaps take</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">me for one of the Sultan's men.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So, without any alarm, I got to where</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the boats were. There was no beach here,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the boats were tied up to the man-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">grove trees that grew along the bank; there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were big boats and little. I saved one of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">small ones, with paddles in it, and untied</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the others, sending each one out into the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stream with a push. The current was fair-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ly swift here, and took them out right</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then I heard a deep, sullen booming from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">far away--it was some kind of a big gong</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or drum up at the palace, and I judged it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was an alarm. So it was, too, for all the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dogs began to bark and the Malays in the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Somebody yelled, in one of the houses,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then began to hit a gong. But Fong</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the professor had found me, and they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tumbled into the boat, and I sent her out</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Maybe they have boats drawn up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">among the trees," I said, pointing to the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ahead of us. " But I've attended to most</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" You're an excellent general," said Fong</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Graves gave a grunt. " You needn't be</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I did not answer, for a burst of shots</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had discovered that we were gone with their</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Taken all in all, I felt rather disappointed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">â€¢â€¢ Never mind all that," I said. With</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some difficulty, owing to the stiffness of my</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Lordy! Who would ever have suspected</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that this old Buddha was hollow up to his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">there is."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Can we get out that way?" asked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Leora.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">That made me stop and think. When I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had thought, I began to feel cold chills</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chasing themselves up and down my back-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bone, although I tried to keep Leora from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suspecting the truth.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">We were shut inside of this big stone</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Buddha like rats in a trap! To lift that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">big flagstone, about three feet square and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a foot thick, was past us; nor could we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">connect the ends of the iron rod which I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had broken. So far as we were concerned,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we were sealed up in there, tight as a drum!</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Even should Fong T'sai come, how would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he know where to find us? We could hear</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nothing, and no one outside could hear any-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing of what passed inside.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Yet, upon second thought, my fear passed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into mere uneasiness. Up above there must</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be openings, and by means of them we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could apprise Fong T'sai of the situation--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when he came. If he were delayed beyond</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sunrise, we might be up against it, for we</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">had nothing to eat or drink. However,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thinks I, the thing to do is to make sure of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">those openings above!</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So, leaving Leora with her electric torch</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">extinguished, I took the other and began</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the ascent. It was no easy matter, either,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the stones stuck out barely a foot, they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ran up steeply, and there was only the wall</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to hang on by. To make it worse, my side</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was beginning to hurt. The one comfort</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was that Leora did not realize that we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stood in any particular danger from any-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At last I got up to the little round</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">balcony; and then, I tell you, I began to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sweat in earnest! There were openings</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">here, three of them. Two of them were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">high up, the other was down almost at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">floor of the balcony, and I judged they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">went to the eyes and mouth of the stone</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">face outside. But they were small, maybe</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an inch or less in diameter, and by flashing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the light into them I saw that they had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been cut for a foot or more through the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">solid stone. I could make some kind of a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">noise through them, but when you remem-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ber that the face of that statue was about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forty-five feet from the ground, and away</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up among the trees, you can see what</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chance I would have of making Fong T'sai</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hear what I said, or understanding it!</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">And when I say that I sweated, I mean</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">just that. I stood before those tiny little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">holes and wiped the sweat from my face,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">although it was not hot inside the statue.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Leora and I were up against it hard, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">no mistake this time! f</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">To save my life, 1 could not see how we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were going to get out of there. If only I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had not shot Candelario, he would have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">known where we had gone; but I had shot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him, and now no one knew. To try to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">break through that statue was hopeless. To</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shoot down one of those holes would tell</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nothing, and they were not large enough</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to push a flag through and wave it ; besides,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">such a signal would remain unseen among</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the tree-tops.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">'â€¢Damn it!" I said to myself. "If I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hadn't broken that iron rod we would have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been all right! But I couldn't pry that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flagstone up with a crowbar--even if I had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was used up, and it went out before I hit</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the floor. I told Leora to save hers until</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">later; then we sat down, and I told her the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">JIM GURNEY, wastrel, was asked by Lynn, the aid of a British government official, to make a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" clean-up " of a gang of pearl pirates and all-round criminals, led by a woman of unusual</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beauty, who made their headquarters on the island of Tarani, in the South Pacific. Jim accepted,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and resolved to make a clean-up of his life, too. He reached the island in a small boat, was cast</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up on the beach, and rescued by Barbara, the beautiful eighteen-year-old daughter of Ronald Goff,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an English trader. She had been brought up free from conventions of any sort, and her father</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">regarded her as a child. But she was budding into womanhood, and objected to being treated as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a " kid " by Jim, whose good pal she became.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Goff had natives build Jim a house near the beach. One night some members of the pirate</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gang, who lived on the other side of the island, came to Goff's store to trade, and their leader,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mme. Miriam Jobert, a woman of rare but barbaric beauty, came to Jim and suggested that he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leave the island. Jim laughed at her, and his house was set afire. The next day he went into the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mountains and was captured by some of the woman's followers, but escaped after a fierce fight,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and after he had been left to die on the beach,.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">For Jim Barbara changed from her usual unconventional attire to the clothing of civilization,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but to her deep anger he paid her but passing notice. But her father realized that she was no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">longer a child.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mme. Jobert again came to Jim's hut, told him that she loved him, and suggested that he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">become a member of her band. Again Jim laughed at her. When Barbara saw the woman with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jim, she ran away in jealous anger. Mme Jobert told him that if he cared to come to her, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would find the path open.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jim rescued a book of romance that Barbara had flung angrily into the sea, and hung it up in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his hut to dry. Realizing that he must make his clean-up, he started for the gang's settlement.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">On the way a native shot an arrow at him, thinking that he was one' of the gang, who treated the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">natives with terrible brutality. Jim made a friend of him, and called him " Useful."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">From a point of vantage he saw a fleet of sloops come in and their crews land at the outlaw</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">village. As darkness fell, sounds of revelry came to him. Leaving Useful, he entered the village,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and confronted the men in the dance-hall. There was a fight, and when things looked bad for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jim, Mme. Jobert interfered, and ordered a man who had been about to shoot the intruder to be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">executed. Then she asked Jim to dance with her--and he accepted.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Lynn did not know that Jim had been assigned to the job. The Englishman was greatly impressed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by the fresh beauty of Barbara and vaguely jealous of Jim, who she called her Lancelot.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">While on a trip along the beach they entered Jim's hut, and Barbara saw the book that he had</seg>
