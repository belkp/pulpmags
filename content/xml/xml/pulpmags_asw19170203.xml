            <seg type="columnLine">Botello waited, feeling that an instant</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">he heard the quick, alarmed whisper of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Inez behind him, and knew she had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Now the blood raced madly through</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Botello's veins. So it was not a native,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then, with whom he had to deal, but a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">white man--perhaps one of those pursuing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him. If they were this close to his trail</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In that instant Botello saw a picture</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">him forever. He gripped the hilt of his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rapier and made ready, determined to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fight his best while fight remained in him.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Perchance this was some soldier who had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and presently they came to the main jun-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gle trail and hurried along it. The trail</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was narrow, overgrown in places--it was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a continual struggle to keep in it and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">make progress. In time they reached the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to look back. In the distance was the re-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Nor was there any sparing of Inez</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">now. De Balboa was to be saved, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">none could be spared in the saving. When</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So on they went through the morning,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">times he let Ruiz carry her. At the top</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of every hill they looked behind as far as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">possible, searching for signs that would</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Perchance they have not sent runners</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was another hill where the dense jungle</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It seemed impossible for them to main-</seg>
