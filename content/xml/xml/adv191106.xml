George Graham Rice, Master Ad- </p><p>enturer in Popular Finance, is making revelations </p><p>:n this series of articles that should be worth mil- </p><p>lions in money saved to American investors. The</p><p>.same keen insight that made him a vital factor in </p><p>the spectacular boom in Nevada mining stocks is </p><p>now at your service to take you behind the scenes </p><p>in promolion-land, and the story is told with the </p><p>same graphic pen that wrote alluring advertise- </p><p>ments and literally put new mining camps od the </p><p>map overnight. In the May Adventure, Mr. </p><p>Rice told how he got into the mining-stock game. </p><p>In this instalment he tells the illuminating talc of </p><p>Bullfrog Rush, the inside facts* about Ihe Guns- </p><p>Nelson prize fight—a new-wrinkle m mining pro- </p><p>motion—and the true story, of Qpjdfield Consoli- </p><p>dated, with its accompanying jncid4i\t9 of money </p><p>madness.

There were other factors </p><p>that entered for the first time in Goldfield, </p><p>too. </p><p> The initial successes of the big display</p><p>udvertising campaigns directed from Gold- </p><p>neld appeared to have been due to the fact </p><p>that the American public had greeted min- </p><p>ing-stock speculation as filling a long-felt </p><p>y/ant, namely, a channel for speculation in </p><p>which they could indulge their gambling </p><p>spirit with comparatively limited resources </p><p>—resources that were insufficient to give </p><p>,.hem a “look-in” on the big exchanges </p><p>-'here the high-priced rails and industrials </p><p>•..re traded in. </p><p>ADVERTISING FOR THINKERS </p><p>HAVING “tried on the dog" my meth- </p><p>ods of advertising for nearly two </p><p>years, that is to say, having conducted an </p><p>advertising agency for mine promoters, and </p><p>!earned the business with their money, I</p><p>had passed through the experimental stage </p><p>and now marshalled a cardinal principle or </p><p>two that I decided must guide me in the </p><p>operations in which I had become more </p><p>directly interested. </p><p> I resolved never to allow an advertise-</p><p>ment to go out of the office that was un- </p><p>convincing to a thinker. If my argument </p><p>convinces the man of affairs, I determined, </p><p>it will certainly succeed with the man of </p><p>no affairs. </p><p> Dogmatically expressed, the idea was</p><p>this: </p><p> Never appeal to the intelligence of fools,</p><p>no matter how easily they may part with </p><p>their money. Turn' your batteries on the </p><p>thinking ones and convince them, and the </p><p>unthinking are bound to follow. </p><p> That principle was applied to the argu-</p><p>ment of the advertisement. </p><p> The headlines were constructed on an</p><p>entirely different principle, namely, to be </p><p>positive to an extreme. </p><p> The Bible was my exemplar. It says,</p><p>“It is” or “It was,” “Thou shalt” or </p><p>“Thou shalt not,” and t.he Bible rarely </p><p>explains or tells why. </p><p> The strength of a headline lies in its</p><p>positiveness. </p><p> The logic which directed that the flaring</p><p>headline of my big display advertising copy </p><p>f.mbrace a very positive statement, and that </p><p>Uit (irgtmr.ii which followed in small type </p><p>be convincing to the thinker, was based on </p><p>a recognition of the fact that, while boldness </p><p>of statement invariably attracts attention, </p><p>analysis is the final resort of the thinker </p><p>before becoming convinced. </p><p> More circumspection was used also in the</p><p>matter of selecting .media for the advertis- </p><p>ing. Newspapers that did not publish in </p><p>their news columns mining-stock quotations </p><p>of issues traded in on the New York Curb, </p><p>the Boston Stock Exchange, the Boston </p><p>Curb, the Salt Lake Stock Exchange or the </p><p>San Francisco Stock Exchange were taboo, </p><p>on the theory that by this time trading in </p><p>mining stocks had grown sufficiently popular </p><p>to command a regular following, and that it </p><p>was easier to appeal to those who had some </p><p>experience in mining-stock speculation than </p><p>to those who had never before ventured. </p><p> Subsequent advertising campaigns were</p><p>always conducted from this viewpoint. I </p><p>did not set the ocean on fire with my Stray </p><p>Dog promotion, the advertising campaign </p><p>of which was conducted on these lines, but </p><p>this was due to circumstances which I ex-</p><p>plain further on. Later, when the Sullivan </p><p>Trust Company grew and prospered, and </p><p>afterward when I reached the East and </p><p>learned more and more of the inside rnechan </p><p>ism of the big Wall Street promotion game </p><p>in rails and industrials as well as mining </p><p>stocks, I became absolute in my opinion </p><p>that my publicity principles were right. </p><p> The mighty powers on Wall Street</p><p>recognize the fact that it is not in the </p><p>nature of things that fools should have </p><p>much money, and thinkers, not fools, are </p><p>the quarry of the successful, modern-day </p><p>promoter, high or low, honest or dis- </p><p>honest. </p><p> A little knowledge is a dangerous thing,</p><p>and the man who thinks he knows it all </p><p>because he has accumulated much money </p><p>in his own pet business enterprise is the </p><p>typical personage on whom the dishonest </p><p>modern-day promoter trains his batteries. </p><p> The honest promoter aims at both the</p><p>thinker who thinks he knows, but doesn’t, </p><p>and the thinker who really does know. </p><p>He is compelled to appeal to both classes </p><p>because the membership of the first out- </p><p>numbers that of the second in the propor- </p><p>tion of about 10,000 to i. </p><p> In fine, to use the parlance of we</p><p>gambler, all promoters, on and off Wall </p><p>Street, of necessity deal for suckers. </p><p>My Adventures with Your Money </p><p>195 </p><p> THE initial Stray Dog and Indian</p><p>Camp promotion campaign was </p><p>only half successful at the outset. </p><p>About 650,000 shares of Stray Dog and </p><p>,3 50,000 shares of Indian Camp had been </p><p>disposed of when the Manhattan boom be- </p><p>gan to lose its intensity. Promotions had </p><p>been made a little too rapidly for public </p><p>digestion. There ^rere more miners at </p><p>work than ever in the Manhattan camp, </p><p>out the demand for securities was not keep- </p><p>ing pace with the supply. Manhattan’s </p><p>initial boom appeared to be flattening out </p><p>just as Goldfield’s first boom had. </p><p> We met with a setback from another di-</p><p>rection. Henry McCornick’s banking con- </p><p>nections in Salt Lake objected to the use </p><p>of his name as president of the Stray Dog. </p><p>At the very height of our advertising cam- </p><p>paign Mr. McCornick resigned. We elected </p><p>our engineer, “Jack” Campbell, president, </p><p>but the damage was done. </p><p> YES, “BUSINESS IS BUSINESS”</p><p>THE offices of the trust company were </p><p>furnished on an elaborate scale, resem-</p><p>bling the interior of a banking institution of </p><p>a large city. The offices became the head- </p><p>quarters of Eastern mining-stock brokers </p><p>whenever they arrived in camp. </p><p> One morning J. C. Weir, a New York</p><p>mining-stock broker, whose firm held an </p><p>option from the trust company on 100,000 </p><p>shares of Stray Dog stock, was ensconced </p><p>in one of the two luxuriously furnished </p><p>rooms used as executive offices. Mr. Weir’s </p><p>firm was one of our selling agents in New </p><p>York. He was the dean of mining-stock </p><p>brokers in New York City. In those early </p><p>days the telephone service of Goldfield was </p><p>not yet perfected, and it was only necessary </p><p>for a person', in order to overhear any talk </p><p>over the telephone, to lift the receiver from </p><p>the nearest hook and listen. It was re- </p><p>ported to me that Mr. Weir had been avail- </p><p>ing himself of this method of learning things </p><p>at first hand. </p><p> :‘Say, Rice,” said Mr. SuJlivan one morn-</p><p>ing, “Weir hears your messages every time </p><p>you are called on the ’phone. He takes </p><p>advantage of you. I wish you would let </p><p>me fix him.” </p><p> “All right; what do you want to do?” I</p><p>answered. </p><p> “Say,” said Mr. Sullivan, “Campbell,</p><p>our engineer, is in Manhattan. I’ll call </p><p>him up from the public station and tell </p><p>him to ’phone you some red-hot news about </p><p>mine developments on Stray Dog, and I’ll </p><p>see to it that Weir is in his office at the time </p><p>you get the message. If Weir don’t grab a </p><p>big block of Stray Dog on the strength of </p><p>it, I’m a poor guesser.” </p><p> All of our options to brokers were to ex -</p><p>pire on the 15th of March and this was </p><p>the 13th. </p><p> At four o’clock in the afternoon I was in</p><p>my room. Mr. Weir was at the desk in the </p><p>room opposite. The ’phone bell rang. </p><p> “Hello,” I said, “who is this?”</p><p> “Campbell, at Manhattan,” was the re-</p><p>sponse. </p><p> “What’s the news, Jack?” I asked.</p><p> “We’ve just struck six feet of §2,000 ore!</p><p>It’s a whale! Never saw a mine as big as </p><p>this one in my life! Don’t sell any more </p><p>Stray Dog under $5 a share!” shouted Mr. </p><p>Campbell. </p><p> “Bully, Jack,” I said, “but keep thai</p><p>information to yourself. Don’t tell your </p><p>mother, and don’t let any more miners go </p><p>down the shaft. Close it up until I am abl:-&gt; </p><p>to buy back some of the stock I sold so </p><p>cheap.”</p><p> Fifteen minutes later Mr. Sullivan am! )’.</p><p>met Mr. Weir leaving the room. </p><p> “Weir,” said I, “your option on Stray</p><p>Dog expires on the 15th at noon. So far, </p><p>your New York office has ordered only </p><p>85,000	shares of the 100,000 that were</p><p>allotted to you. We have decided to close </p><p>subscriptions on the moment and wish you </p><p>would ware your New York office not to </p><p>sell any more.” </p><p> “You arc wrong,” said Mr. Weir; “why,</p><p>when I left New York we had oversold </p><p>our entire allotment! If the office has no; </p><p>notified you of this, it has been a slip. We </p><p>will, in fact, need at. least 25,000 share* </p><p>more than have been ordered.” </p><p> “You can’t have them,” said I.</p><p> “Not in a thousand years!” put in Mr,</p><p>Sullivan. </p><p> Mr. Weir sent a bunch of code messages</p><p>to New York. All the next day Mr. Sulli </p><p>van spent with Mr. Weir. Ke allowed Mr. </p><p>Weir to cajole him into letting him have </p><p>the entire block of stock. Finally, it wa&gt; </p><p>agreed between Mr. Weir and Mr. Sullivan </p><p>that Mr. Sullivan would give him the addi </p><p>tional stock whether I consented or not </p><p>Surreptitiously, according to Mr. Weir’s </p><p>idea, Mr. Sullivan was yielding to him, </p><p>396 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>without my knowledge and against my </p><p>wishes. </p><p> Next day tlie Sullivaa Trijst...Company</p><p>shipped to Mr.- Weir’s firm in New York </p><p>25,000	shares of T.tray l)og attached to</p><p>draft at 45 cents a share, The draft was </p><p>{;aid. Mr. Weir must have burned his </p><p>fingers by the operation. </p><p>A FEW weeks after this, and at </p><p>a period when Manhattan’s initial </p><p>boom was easing off, San Francisco </p><p>was destroyed by earthquake and fire. </p><p>Not less than half of the capital invested in </p><p>Manhattan stocks had come out of the city </p><p>of San Francisco, where Manhattan was in </p><p>much higher favor even than in the East. </p><p>The earthquake was fatal to Manhattan. </p><p>The San Francisco Stock Exchange, which </p><p>was the principal market for Manhattan </p><p>mining shares, was compelled to discontinue </p><p>business for over two months. Brokers and </p><p>transfer companies lost their records, and </p><p>the public’s property and monfey loss was so </p><p>appalling that no more money was forth- </p><p>coming from the Coast for-mining enter- </p><p>prises. Every bank in Nevada closed down, </p><p>just as every California bank did, the Gov-</p><p>ernors of both States declaring a series of </p><p>legal holidays to enable the financial insti- </p><p>tutions to gain time. Nevada banks, as a </p><p>rule, had cleared through San Francisco </p><p>banks, and there was much money tied up </p><p>by the catastrophe. </p><p> The Sullivan Trust Company faced a crisis.</p><p>I had decided it was good business to lend </p><p>support to Jumping Jack in the stock mar- </p><p>ket when the Manhattan boom began to </p><p>relax from its first tension, and had accu- </p><p>mulated several hundred thousand shares </p><p>at an average of 35 cents. The Trust com- </p><p>pany had only $8,000 in gold in its vaults on </p><p>the day of the ’quake. Moneys deposited </p><p>in bank were not available. Of the $8,000 </p><p>in gold coin, $6,500 was paid two days after </p><p>the earthquake to the Wells-Fargo Express </p><p>Company for an automobile which was in </p><p>transit at the time, and for which Wells- </p><p>Fargo demanded the coin. It was impossi- </p><p>ble to hypothecate securities of any descrip- </p><p>tion in Nevada or San Francisco. </p><p> With the Sullivan Trust Company 's funds</p><p>tied up in closed-up banks, and with an un- </p><p>stable line of securites in its vaults, it was </p><p>“ up ggainst it.’: For a period it looked as </p><p>if we must go to the wall. Tor two months </p><p>we ekecl out c. bare subsistence by the direct </p><p>saie of Manhattan securities at reduced </p><p>prices to the Eastern brokers. This pur- </p><p>chasing power came largely from broker., </p><p>who were “short” of stocks to the public on </p><p>commitments made at a much higher range </p><p>of prices and needed the actual certificate.-, </p><p>for deliveries. </p><p> It took the Nevada banks and the San</p><p>Francisco Stock Exchange more than sixty </p><p>days to rehabilitate themselves. No sooner </p><p>did the San Francisco Stock Exchange open </p><p>for business than it became possible for the </p><p>Sullivan Trust Company to borrow some </p><p>much needed cash on Manhattan securities, </p><p>of which it had a plethora. Through mem- </p><p>bers of the San Francisco Stock Exchange, il </p><p>obtained in this way in the neighborhood of </p><p>$100,000. Goldfield banks supplied an- </p><p>other $100,000 a little later by the same </p><p>process. </p><p> -FORTUNES THAT WERE MISSED</p><p>BOUT this time the Mohawk of Gold- </p><p>field began to give indications of being </p><p>the wonderful treasure-house it has since </p><p>proved to be. Hayes and Monnette, who </p><p>owned a lease on a small section of the prop </p><p>erty, had struck high-grade ore and were </p><p>producing at the rate of $3,000 per day. A </p><p>few weeks later it was reported that the</p><p>output had increased to $5,000 a day. </p><p> The Mohawk being situated onlya stone's</p><p>throw from the Combination mine, the idea </p><p>that the Mohawk might turn out to be an- </p><p>other Combination was common in Gold- </p><p>field. Hayes and Monnette were startled— </p><p>almost frightened—at their success. Yield- </p><p>ing for the moment to the warning of friends, </p><p>who urged upon them the possibility of the </p><p>ore soon pinching out, Hayes and Monnette </p><p>called at the offices of the Trust Company </p><p>and offered to sell their lease, which had six </p><p>months to run, for $200,000 cash and $400,- </p><p>000	to be taken out of the [net proceeds of</p><p>the ore. </p><p> “I will take it,” I said.</p><p> I sent over to the State Bank &amp; Tru.s:</p><p>Company, and had a check certified for the </p><p>820c,oco. I was about to close the deal, </p><p>when Mr. Sullivan and “Jack” Campbell </p><p>protested. </p><p> “I ought to have fifteen days to examuu-</p><p>the mine,” urged Mr. Campbell. </p><p> “It is too big a chance to take,” declarer]</p><p>Mr. Sullivan. </p><p> When appealed to, Hayes and Monnette</p><p>My Adventures with yowHCcfoney </p><p>197 </p><p>said that J.u allow a fifteen-day examination </p><p>would mean practically to shut down the </p><p>property for that period and would result in </p><p>a positive loss to them because of the lim- </p><p>i ted period of their lease. The possible loss, </p><p>if the deal fell through, was too large to con- </p><p>template, and they refused. </p><p>FDAY by day, as Mr. Campbell and </p><p>, _ Mr. Sullivan dilly-dallied, the out- </p><p>put of the lease increased, and when, </p><p>a fortnight later, all three of us were unan- </p><p>imously in favor of the proposition, Hayes </p><p>and Monette flatly refused to sell. Within </p><p>half a year that lease on the Mohawk pro- </p><p>duced in the neighborhood of $6,000,000 </p><p>worth of ore gross, and netted the leasers </p><p>about $4,500,000. The L. M. Sullivan </p><p>Trust Company certainly ‘‘overlooked a </p><p>bet” there. </p><p> E About this time I spent an evening with</p><p> Henry Peery and W. H. ("Daddy”) Clark.</p><p> “Daddy” Clark, like Mr. Peery, came from</p><p> Salt Lake. Mr. Clark had successfully pro-</p><p> moted the Bullfrog Gibraltar. Seated</p><p> around a table in the Palm Restaurant, the</p><p> conversation turned to new camps.</p><p> “Rice,” said Mr. Clark. “I expect to be</p><p> able to put you in on a towns|te deal in a</p><p> couple of weeks that-wjU make you some</p><p> money if you undertake to give the camp</p><p> some publicity.”</p><p> “Good* said I.</p><p> “I am having some assays run,” he said,</p><p> “of some samples which were brought into</p><p> camp last night by a couple of prospectors,</p><p> and if they turn out to be what the prospec-</p><p> tors claim, or anything near it, we’ll need</p><p> your services to put a new camp on the</p><p> map.’’</p><p> That night Mr. Peery learned from the</p><p> assayer that the lowest assay of 16 samples</p><p> was $86, and the highest $475, per tea.</p><p> Next morning Mr. Peery informed me that</p><p> he had worked all night on Mr. Clark to</p><p> learn where the ore came from. Mr. Peery</p><p> said Mr. Clark had told him, in the wee sma?</p><p> hours, that the rich stuff came from Fair-</p><p> i-iew Peak, fifty miles east of Fallon.</p><p> “Rice,” said Mr. Peery, “let’s beat him</p><p> to it. He’s going to trek it across the</p><p> desert by mule team with a camp outfit</p><p> to-morrow, and it will take him a week to</p><p> get there.”</p><p> 'Billy” Taylor, who was interested with</p><p> Mr. Peer}- in a Bullfrog enterprise, joined</p><p> :he party, and we each gave Mr. Peery p</p><p> chcck lor S500, forming a pool of $1,500 to</p><p> send a man to Fair view to buy properties</p><p> there. Mr, jPeeiy wired the Bank of the</p><p> Republic af 'Salf Lake tv pay Ben Luce</p><p> $1,500, and instructed M,..-Luce by wire</p><p> to take the money, go to Fr^rview aiid do</p><p> business.</p><p> It was nearly two weeks be/ore we 1 tea i d</p><p>of either Mr. Clark or Mr. luce. Mr. </p><p>Clark returned to camp and said he had </p><p>purchased the Nevada Hills property, </p><p>scene of the big find, for $5,000, and that it </p><p>was a “world-beater." </p><p> “Did you meet any outsiders there?”</p><p>queried Mr. Peery. </p><p> “Yes,” said Mr. Clark, “I met a man</p><p>named Luce who almost got ahead of me. </p><p>In fact, he did buy the property before I </p><p>got there, but he had no money, and they </p><p>would not take his check for $500, which </p><p>was the deposit required. I had the gold </p><p>with me, and that settled it.” </p><p> A few days afterward, Mr. Luce came to</p><p>Goldfield. </p><p> “I didn’t get the big one,” he said, “but</p><p>I bought the Eagle’s Nest, near by, for </p><p>$7,000, of which $500 was demanded to be </p><p>paid down, and there is ore in it and it </p><p>looks good to me. I had no money with </p><p>me when I arrived in Fairview. They re- </p><p>fused my check for the Nevada Hills, but </p><p>the Eagle’s Nest boys took it for the first</p><p>payment of $500.” </p><p> Mr. Luce was not at home when Mr</p><p>Peery’s despatch was delivered in Salt Lake. </p><p>When it reached him the bank was closed. </p><p>In order to catch the first train he was com- </p><p>pelled to leave the money behind. He ar- </p><p>rived in Fairview minus the $1,500, and </p><p>thereby lost the Nevada Hills for Mr. Peery, </p><p>Mr. Taylor and the Sullivan Trust Com- </p><p>pany. </p><p> Mr. Clark and his partners incorporated</p><p>the Nevada Hills for r,000,000 shares of </p><p>the par value of $5 each and accepted sub- </p><p>scriptions at $1 per share. </p><p> Within a few months the Nevada Hills</p><p>paid $375,000 in dividends out of ore, and </p><p>soon thereafter, at the height of the Gold- </p><p>field boom, it was reported that the owners </p><p>of the control refused an offer of $6,000,000 </p><p>:or the property. The mine has turned out </p><p>to be a bonanza The stock of the company </p><p>sold recently on the New York Curb and </p><p>San Francisco Stock Exchange at a valua- </p><p>tion for the mine of $3,000,000, and.it is </p><p>believed by well-posted mining men to </p><p>198 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>be worth all of. that. George Wingfield, </p><p>president of the Goldfield Consolidated, </p><p>who followed the Sullivan Trust Company </p><p>into Fairview and bought the Fairview </p><p>Eagle, which is sandwiched in between the </p><p>Nevada Hills and the Eagle’s Nest, is now </p><p>president of the Nevada Hills. Treasury </p><p>stock of the Fairview Eagle was sold in </p><p>Goldfield at 40 cents per share. </p><p>HgH “JACK” CAMPBELL reported </p><p>iffPIl favorably on tbe Eagle’s Nest, and </p><p>we decided to organize and promote </p><p>a company to own and develop the property. </p><p> The Sullivan Trust Company bought</p><p>Mr. Taylor’s interest in the Eagle’s Nest </p><p>for $8,000, Mr. Luce’s for $8,000 (he had </p><p>been awarded a quarter interest for his </p><p>work), and Mr. Peery’s for $30,000. It </p><p>made the property the basis for the promo- </p><p>tion of the Eagle’s Nest Fairview Mining </p><p>Company, capitalized for 1,000,000 shares </p><p>of the par value of $5 each- Governor John </p><p>Sparks accepted our invitation to become </p><p>president of the company. The entire </p><p>capitalization was sold to the public through </p><p>Kastern and Western stock brokers within </p><p>thirty days at a subscription price of 35 </p><p>cents per share. After paying for the </p><p>property, our net profits were in the </p><p>neighborhood of $150,000. </p><p> The Eagle’s Nest deal enabled the trust</p><p>company to repay most of the money it had </p><p>borrowed after the San Francisco earth- </p><p>quake, and this put the company on its </p><p>feet again. </p><p>THE FETCHING TALE OF BULLFROG RUSH </p><p>T?OLLOWING the Eagle’s Nest promo- </p><p>tion, the Sullivan Trust Company be- </p><p>came sponsor for Bullfrog Rush. I had met </p><p>Dr. J. Grant Lyman, owner of the property, </p><p>on the lawn of one of the cottagcs of the United </p><p>States Hotel in Saratoga a few years before, </p><p>where he raced a string of horses and mixed </p><p>with good people, and I was glad to renew </p><p>his acquaintance on the desert. Dr. Lyman </p><p>bought the Bullfrog Rush property for </p><p>$150,000. I was present when he paid </p><p>$100,000 of this money in cash at John S. </p><p>Cook &amp; Company’s bank in Goldfield. The </p><p>Bullfrog Rush property was of large acre- </p><p>age, enjoyed splendid surface showings, and </p><p>was situated contiguous to the Tramps </p><p>Consolidated, which was then selling around </p><p>S3 a sbare. It looked like a fine prospect. </p><p> Dr. Lyman incorporated the company</p><p>for 1,000,000 shares of the par value of $1 </p><p>each. The services of the Sullivan Trus! </p><p>Company were employed to finance the </p><p>enterprise for mine development. The </p><p>Trust company obtained an option on the </p><p>treasury stock of the company at 35 cent: </p><p>per share, and proceeded to dispose of it </p><p>through Eastern brokers and direct to the </p><p>public by advertising, at 45 cents per share </p><p>to brokers and 50 cents per share to in- </p><p>vestors. We sold 200,000 shares, realizing </p><p>$90,000 in less than thirty days, retained </p><p>$20,000 for commission and expenses, and </p><p>turned into the treasury of the Bullfrog </p><p>Rush company $70,000, all of which was </p><p>placed at the disposal of the company for </p><p>mine development. </p><p> Half a dozen tunnels were run and several</p><p>shafts were sunk. Down to the 400-foot </p><p>level the mine appeared to be of much </p><p>promise. It was then learned that the </p><p>shaft at the 4oo-foot point had encountered </p><p>a bed of lime. It appeared that all the </p><p>properties on Bonanza Mountain, where the </p><p>Bullfrog Rush was situated, including the </p><p>Tramps Consolidated, which was then sell- </p><p>ing in the market at a valuation of $3,000.- </p><p>000,	were bound to turn out to be rank</p><p>mining failures. The entire hill, according </p><p>to our engineer, was a “slide,” and below the </p><p>4oo-foot point ore could not possibly exist. </p><p> We thereupon notified Dr. Lyman thai</p><p>we would discontinue the sale of the stock </p><p>until such time as the property gave better</p><p>indications of making a mine. </p><p> A few weeks later Dr. Lyman entered my</p><p>private office unannounced. At this period </p><p>Jumping Jack, Stray Dog, Indian Camp, </p><p>and Eagle’s Nest were all selling on the San </p><p>Francisco Stock Exchange at an average oi </p><p>35 per cent, above promotion prices. The </p><p>L. M. Sullivan Trust Company was “mak- </p><p>ing good” to investors. Bullfrog Rush had </p><p>not yet been listed, and we were afraid to </p><p>give it a market quotation. </p><p> “I have formed here in Goldfield the</p><p>Union Securities Company,” Dr. Lyman </p><p>said, as he sat down close to my desk, “ant- </p><p>I am going into the promotion business my- </p><p>self. I don’t believe a word of the reports </p><p>you have that the Bullfrog Rush is no good. </p><p>I am going on with the promotion.” </p><p> “You won’t!” I protested. “We shall</p><p>not permit it. Governor Sparks, who is the </p><p>best friend the Sullivan Trust Company </p><p>has, accepted- the presidency of the Bull- </p><p>My Adventures with Yma’^ivtoney </p><p>199 </p><p>hog Rush Oil our assurance that the prop- </p><p>erty. was a good one. John S. Cook, the </p><p>leading banker of this town, accepted the </p><p>ireasurership on the same representations. </p><p>.Mr. Sullivan, president of this trust com- </p><p>pany, is.vice-president of the Rush. Don’t </p><p>dare go on with the promotion at this time. </p><p>If you do, you’ll get us into trouble, and we </p><p>shall take drastic action.” </p><p> Dr. Lyman left the office without .utter-</p><p>ing a word. </p><p>EH/S TWO days later I received a dis- </p><p>gJug patch from Governor Sparks saying </p><p>that a full-page advertisement of the </p><p>Union Securities Company had appeared in </p><p>the Nevada State Journal at Reno, offering </p><p>Bullfrog Rush stock for subscription. The </p><p>Governor protested vigorously against the </p><p>sale of the stock. We had previously in- </p><p>jformed him as to the new conditions which </p><p>'prevailed at the mine. </p><p>|&gt; I sent Peter Grant, one of Mr. Sullivan’s </p><p>•partners in the Palace, to Dr. Lyman to </p><p>protest. The answer came back that the </p><p>Nevada State Journal advertisement was </p><p>about to be reproduced in all the newspapers </p><p>of big circulation throughout the East, and </p><p>that the orders for the advertisements would </p><p>not be canceled. Half an hour later Dr. </p><p>Lyman entered the office with Mr. Grant. </p><p>M;. Grant looked nettled, Dr. Lyman </p><p>glowered. </p><p> I bade Dr. Lyman take a chair.</p><p> “If you move a finger to stop me,” he</p><p>said, as he sat himself down before me, “I’ll </p><p>expose every act of yours since you were </p><p>born and show up who the boss of this trust </p><p>company really is! ” </p><p> Dr. Lyman was tall as a poplar and mus-</p><p>cled like a Samson, Ke was fresh from the </p><p>East, red-cheeked and groomed like a </p><p>Chesterfield. I was cadaverous, desert- </p><p>worn, office-fagged, and undersized by com- </p><p>parison. In a glove fight. Dr. Lyman could </p><p>probably have finished me in half a round. </p><p>But the disparity did not occur to me. The </p><p>sense of injustice made me forget everything </p><p>except Dr. Lyman’s blackmailing threat I </p><p>jumped to my feet. Dr. Lyman backed up </p><p>to the glass door. I aimed a blow at him. </p><p>He backed away to dodge it. In a second </p><p>he had collided with the big plate-glass pane, </p><p>which fell with a crash. In another instant </p><p>he recovered his feet, turned on his heel and </p><p>ran. His face was covered with scratches, </p><p>the result of his encounter with the broken </p><p>plate glass. Several clerks who followed </p><p>him, thinking he had committed some vio- </p><p>lent act, reported that he didn’t stop run- </p><p>ning until he reached the end of the block. </p><p> CLEANING HOUSE IN BULLFROG RUSH</p><p>AFTER Dr. Lyman’s hurried exit I </p><p>was quick to decide upon a course of </p><p>action. </p><p> The position of the trust company was</p><p>this: With the exception of Bullfrog Rush, </p><p>we had a string of stock-market winners to </p><p>our credit with the public. If we allowed </p><p>Dr. Lyman to go ahead with his promotion </p><p>of Bullfrog Rush, we .should, unless we </p><p>abandoned our rule to protect our stocks in </p><p>the market, be compelled some day to buj </p><p>back all of the stock he sold. The truth </p><p>about the mine was bound to come out, and </p><p>we stood before the public as its sponsors. </p><p> I decided that the trust company should</p><p>refund the money paid in by stockholders </p><p>of Bullfrog Rush and prevent Dr. Lyman </p><p>from selling more stock. </p><p> To the brokers, through whom we had</p><p>sold much of the stock to the public, we </p><p>telegraphed that we would refund the exact </p><p>amount paid us by the brokers on delivery </p><p>back to us of the certificates. We also </p><p>wired to Governor Sparks and asked his </p><p>permission to insert an advertisement in the </p><p>newspapers over his signature, announcing </p><p>that the property had proved to be a mining </p><p>failure and advising the public not to buy </p><p>any more shares. This pleased the Gov- </p><p>ernor immensely, for he promptly wired </p><p>back his 0. K. with congratulations over the</p><p>stand we took. </p><p>SWffg THAT night a broadside warning </p><p>to the public, bearing the signature </p><p>of Governor John Sparks, and ? </p><p>separate advertisement of the Sullivan </p><p>Trust Company, offering to refund the </p><p>money paid for Bullfrog Rush shares, were </p><p>telegraphed to all the leading newspaper? </p><p>of the East. Next day both of these an- </p><p>nouncements appeared side by side with </p><p>the half-page and full-page advertisements </p><p>of Dr. Lyman’s Union Securities Company </p><p>of Goldtield offering Bullfrog Rush for pub- </p><p>lic subscription. </p><p> The effect, of course, was that the public</p><p>didn’t buy any more Bullfrog Rush shares. </p><p> The Bullfrog Rush incident cost the Sul-</p><p>livan Trust Company a little less than </p><p>200 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>$90,000, which was refunded to stockhold- </p><p>ers, and about $20,000 additional that had </p><p>been expended lor publicity. Dr. Lyman </p><p>was stripped of his entire investment in </p><p>the property. The newspapers lost many </p><p>thousands of dollars, representing Dr. Ly- </p><p>man’s unpaid advertising bills. A number </p><p>of mining-stock brokers also forfeited some </p><p>money; they were compelled to refund </p><p>their commissions. </p><p> J. C. Weir, the New York mining-stock</p><p>broker, had sold in the neighborhood of </p><p>100.000	shares of Bullfrog Rush to his</p><p>clients, and he took violent exception to </p><p>our decision not to refund an amount in </p><p>excess of the net price paid to us. He held </p><p>that his firm ought not to be compelled to </p><p>disgorge its profit. We stood pat and </p><p>argued that he ought to be proud to share </p><p>with us the glory of ‘‘making good” in such </p><p>an unusual way to stockholders. It was </p><p>the first time in the history of Western min- </p><p>ing promotions that a thing like this had </p><p>ever been done, and we pointed out to Mr. </p><p>Weir that it would gain reputation both for </p><p>himself and the trust company. For a </p><p>period Mr. Weir carried on an epistolary </p><p>warfare with the trust company. For </p><p>nearly two months he refused to yield. </p><p>Finally, we received a letter from Mr. Weir </p><p>saying that since we refused to come to his </p><p>terms he would accept ours, and that he had </p><p>drawn on us for $4,500, with one lot of </p><p>10.000	shares of Bullfrog Rush stock at-</p><p>tached. On receipt of the letter I gave </p><p>instructions to the cashier promptly to </p><p>honor the draft. </p><p> An hour later the cashier reported that</p><p>the draft had been presented and that an </p><p>examination of the stock certificates showed </p><p>that not a single one of them had been sold </p><p>by the trust company through Mr. Weir’s </p><p>.firm, and, in fact, had never been disposed </p><p>of by the trust company to anybody. A </p><p>hurried examination of the stock-certtficate </p><p>books of the Bullfrog Rush Company, which </p><p>were in the hands of the company’s secre- </p><p>tary in Goldfield, a clerk of Dr. Lyman, re- </p><p>vealed the fact that a large number of </p><p>blank certificates had been torn out of the </p><p>certificate books, without any entry appear- </p><p>ing on the stubs. </p><p> The certificates returned to us by Mr.</p><p>Weir bore dates of several months prior, </p><p>and our immediate assumption was that </p><p>Dr. Lyman, at the very moment when we </p><p>were marketing the treasury 'stock under a </p><p>binding contract which forbade him or any </p><p>one else to dispose of any Bullfrog Rush </p><p>stock under any circumstances, was clan- </p><p>destinely getting rid of these shares. Mr. </p><p>Weir, it appeared, had neglected to seg- </p><p>regate Dr. Lyman’s certificates from those </p><p>shipped him by the trust company. An </p><p>other hypothesis was that those certificates </p><p>had never been sold at all, but had </p><p>merely been received from Dr. Lyman {■"&gt; </p><p>be reforwarded to us in order to claim a </p><p>refund for what we had never been paid </p><p>for. </p><p> Of course, we returned the draft unpaid.</p><p>But that didn’t end the incident. My part- </p><p>ner, Mr. Sullivan, took it upon himself to </p><p>wire his sentiments’ to the man who had </p><p>tried to turn the trick as follows: “You </p><p>are so crooked that if you swallowed a ten- </p><p>penny nail and vomited, it would come </p><p>out a corkscrew.” That was “Larry’s” </p><p>homely way of expressing his opinion. </p><p>GOLDFIELD’S year of wind and </p><p>dust had brightened into the glow </p><p>of Summer. The still breath oi </p><p>August was diffused through the thin mild </p><p>air of the high altitude. This thin air, </p><p>which nearly two years before had prompted </p><p>a camp wit to comment on the birth of my </p><p>news bureau to the effect that “the high </p><p>elevation was ideal for the concoction of tht </p><p>visionary stuff that dreams are made of,” </p><p>appeared unprophetic. There was plenty </p><p>of concrete evidence of the yellow metal to </p><p>be seen. Production from the mines was in- </p><p>creasing daily and money from speculators </p><p>was pouring into the camp from every di- </p><p>rection. </p><p> A mining-stock boom of gigantic propor-</p><p>tions was brewing. Mohawk of Goldfield. </p><p>which was incorporated for x,000,000 shares </p><p>of the par value of Si each, and which in </p><p>the early days went begging at 10 cents a </p><p>share, was now selling around $2 a share on </p><p>the San Francisco Stock Exchange, the </p><p>Goldfield Stock Exchange and the New </p><p>York Curb. Other Goldfields had advanced </p><p>in proportion. Combination Fraction was </p><p>up from 25 cents to Si.’is. Silver Pick, </p><p>which was promoted at 15 cents a share, </p><p>was selling at 50 cents. Jumbo Extension </p><p>advanced from 15 to 60. Red Top, which </p><p>was offered in large blocks at 8 cents per </p><p>share two years before, was selling at $1. </p><p>Jumbo advanced from 25 cents to $1.25. </p><p>Atlanta moved up from 12 to 40. Fifty </p><p>My Adventures with Yp.ur-'Monev </p><p>201 </p><p>others, representing prospects, enjoyed, pro- </p><p>portionate advances. </p><p> The Sullivan stocks were light in the</p><p>swim. Jumping Jack was in hot demand </p><p>on-the' San Francisco Stock Exchange and </p><p>New York Curb at 45 cents, Stray Dog at </p><p>70 cents, Indian Camp at 80 cents, and </p><p>Eagle’s Nest at 50 cents. Subscribers to </p><p>Indian Camp couid cash in at a profit of </p><p>'more than 200 per cent. </p><p> The country gave indications of going</p><p>Goldfield crazy.” My Goldfield publicity </p><p>bureau was working overtime. James </p><p>Hopper, the noted fiction writer and tnaga- </p><p>zinist, ably assisted by Harry Hedrick and </p><p>other competent mining reporters, was “on </p><p>the job ” and doing yeoman service. The </p><p>aews-columns of the daily papers of the </p><p>country teemed with stories of the Goldfield </p><p>excitement. </p><p> People began to liock into the camp in</p><p>droves. The town was a scene of bustle and </p><p>life. Motley groups assembled at every </p><p>corner and discussed the great production </p><p>being made from the Mohawk and the ter- </p><p>rific market advances being chronicled by </p><p>mining stocks representing all sorts and </p><p>descriptions of Goldfield properties. When- </p><p>ever Hayes and Monnette, owners of the </p><p>M ohawk lease, appeared 011 the streets, they </p><p>were followed by a mixed throng of the </p><p>riffraff of the camp, who hailed them, open- </p><p>mouthed, as wonders. </p><p> The madness of speculation in mining</p><p>shares in the camp itself was beginning to </p><p>exceed in its intensity the exciting play </p><p>at the gaming tables. There was a con- </p><p>tagion of excitement even in the open spaces </p><p>of the street.</p><p> At each meeting of the Goldfieljl Stock</p><p>Exchange the boardroom was crowded. </p><p>The sessions were tempestuous. Every step </p><p>and every hallway leading to the room was </p><p>jammed with men and women over whose </p><p>faces all lights and shades of expression </p><p>Sit ted. The bidding for mining issues was </p><p>frantic. Profits mounted high. Every- </p><p>body seemed to be buying and no one </p><p>appeared to be willing to sell except at a </p><p>big advance over the last quotations. Cas- </p><p>■;le-building and fumes of fancy usurped </p><p>reason. </p><p> Bank deposits - were increasing by leaps</p><p>wnd bounds. The camp was rapidly be- </p><p>coming druni; vith the joy of fortune </p><p>making. </p><p> Manhattan now shone mostly in the re-</p><p>flected glory of Goldfield, but Manhattan </p><p>stocks were booming. This enabled the </p><p>Sullivan Trust Company' to dispose of </p><p>nearly all of its Manhattan securities which </p><p>had been carried over after -the San Fran- </p><p>cisco catastrophe and to pile up a great </p><p>reserve of cash. </p><p> A big demand was developing for shares</p><p>in Fairview companies. Nevada Hills of </p><p>Fairview was selling on the stock exchanges </p><p>and curbs at $3 per share, or a valuation of </p><p>$3,000,000 for the mine. Only a few months </p><p>before it. had fallen into Goldfield and Salt </p><p>Lake hands for $5,000. Fairview Eagle’s </p><p>Nest, for which subscriptions had been </p><p>accepted at 35 cents per share by the Sulli- </p><p>van Trust Company, was selling at 70 cents </p><p>on the San Francisco Stock Exchange. </p><p> The Sullivan Trust Company announced</p><p>the offering of x,000,000 shares, embracing </p><p>the entire capitalization of the Fairview </p><p>Hailstone Mining Company, at 25 cents. </p><p>The stock was purchased by us at 8 cents. </p><p>We sold out in a week. San Francisco and </p><p>Salt Lake were the principal buyers, and it </p><p>was unnecessary even to insert an advertise- </p><p>ment. offering the stock. The brokers fell </p><p>over one another to underwrite the offering </p><p>by telegraph. </p><p> PRIZE FIGHTS AND MINING PROMOTION</p><p>TT'OR a fortnight there was a lull in </p><p>-F news of sensational gold discoveries, </p><p>but the approaching Gans-Nelson fight, </p><p>which was arranged to be held in Gold- </p><p>field on Labor Day, September 3, fur- </p><p>nished sufficient exciting reading matter for </p><p>the newspapers throughout the land to keep </p><p>the Goldfield news pot boiling. The Sulli- </p><p>van Trust Company had guaranteed the </p><p>promoters of the fight against loss to the</p><p>extent of $10,000, and other camp interests </p><p>put up $50,000 more. Gans, the fighter, </p><p>was without funds to put up his forfeit and </p><p>make the match, and the Sullivan Trust </p><p>Company had also advanced the money for </p><p>that purpose. Mr. Sullivan became Gans’ </p><p>manager. When Gans arrived in town Mr. </p><p>Sullivan interviewed him to this effect: </p><p> “Gans, if you lose this fight they’ll kili</p><p>you here in Goldfield; they’ll think you laid </p><p>down. I and my friends are going to bet a </p><p>ton of money on you, and you must win.” </p><p> Gans promised he would do his best.</p><p> “Tex” Rickard and his friends wagered</p><p>on Nelson. The cashier of :he 'Sullivan </p><p>202 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Trust Company was instructed to cover all </p><p>the money that any one wanted to bet at </p><p>odds of 10 to 8 and 10 to 7 on Gans, we </p><p>taking the Gans end. A sign was hung in </p><p>the window reading: “A large sum of </p><p>money has been placed with us to • wager </p><p>on Gans. Nelson money promptly covered </p><p>inside.”-'-. Mr. Sullivan was in his glory. </p><p>Prize-fighting suited his tastes better than </p><p>high finance, and he was as busy as a one- </p><p>armed paper-hanger with the itch. </p><p> An argument arose about who should</p><p>referee the fight. “Tex” Rickard nomi- </p><p>nated George Siler, of Chicago, and Battling </p><p>Nelson promptly 0. K’d the selection. Mr. </p><p>Sullivan objected. He sent for the news- </p><p>paper men and gave out an interview in </p><p>which he declared that Mr. Siler was preju- </p><p>diced against Gans because he was a negro, </p><p>and he did not believe Mr. Siler would give </p><p>Gans a fair shake. </p><p> “Rice,” whispered Sullivan after the</p><p>newspaper men left the office, “I am four- </p><p>ftushing about that race-prejudice yam, but </p><p>it won’t do any harm. Siler needs the job. </p><p>He’s broke and I’ll make him eat out of my </p><p>hand before I’ll agree to let him referee the </p><p>fight. They’ve already invited Siler to </p><p>confe here, and I won’t be able to get another </p><p>referee, but I’ll beat them at their own game. </p><p>When Siler gets here I’ll thrash matters out </p><p>with him and agree to his selection, but first </p><p>I want him to know who’s boss.” </p><p> Mr. Siler arrived. An hour later he was</p><p>closeted with Mr. Sullivan in one of the back </p><p>rooms of the trust company offices. The </p><p>dialogue which ensued was substantially as </p><p>follows: </p><p> Mr. Siler. You’ve got me dead wrong,</p><p>Sullivan. I want to referee this fight, and </p><p>1 want you to withdraw your objections.</p><p> Mr. Sullivan. Well, I’ve heard from</p><p>sources which I can’t tell you anything </p><p>about that you don’t like Gans, and I can’t </p><p>stand for you. </p><p> Mr. Siler. I need this fight, and I’ve</p><p>come all the way from Chicago in the ex- </p><p>pectation of refereeing it. I couldn’t give </p><p>Gans the worst of it if I wanted to. He is </p><p>a clean fighter and I would not have an </p><p>excuse. </p><p> Mr. Sullivan. Gans is a clean fighter,</p><p>but Nelson isn’t; he uses dirty tactics and </p><p>he is a fouler for fair. </p><p> Mr. Siler, li he does any fouling in this</p><p>fight I'll-make him quit or declare him out. </p><p> Mr Sullivan. What guarantee have I</p><p>got that you won’t give Gans the worst </p><p>of it? </p><p> Mr. Siler. Well, I’ll tell you, Sullivan, if</p><p>you withdraw your objections I’ll guaran- </p><p>tee you that I’ll be this fair. If Nelson </p><p>uses foul tactics, or if he don’t, I’ll show my </p><p>fairness to Gaas by giving him the benefit </p><p>of every doubt. Now, will that satisfy you? </p><p> Mr. Sullivan. Yes, it’ll satisfy me, but,</p><p>remember, if you don't keep your , word </p><p>you’ll have ju?t as much chance of getting </p><p>out of this town alive as Gans will havc- </p><p>if he lays down! You understand? </p><p> Mr. Siler. Yes.</p><p>ON THE afternoon of the fight the </p><p>Sullivan Trust Company cast ac- </p><p>counts and found that it had wa- </p><p>gered $45,000 on Gans against a total of </p><p>$32,500 put up on Nelson. </p><p> Mr. Sullivan, after talking it over with</p><p>me, had accepted the honorary position of </p><p>announcer at the ringside. Though not of </p><p>aristocratic mien, “Larry” was of fine </p><p>physique, with a bold, bluff countenance, </p><p>and I felt confident thatr-his cordial manner </p><p>would appeal to the assemblage, </p><p> Just before the prize-fighters entered the</p><p>ring, “Larry” jumped into the arena. </p><p>Standing above the mass of moving heads </p><p>and holding up both hands, he hailed the </p><p>great crowd thus:	—~</p><p> “Gentlemen, we are assembled in this</p><p>grand arena to witness a square fight. This </p><p>fight is held under the auspices of ‘Tex’ </p><p>Rickard, a man of great acclumuations-” </p><p> “Larry” did not get much farther. The</p><p>audience laughed, and' then jeered and </p><p>hooted until it became hoarse. His words </p><p>were drowned in the tempest of derision. </p><p>I was informed by friends who were close </p><p>to the ringside that he went on in the same- </p><p>rambling way for a few minutes more, but</p><p>I can’t testify to that fact from my own </p><p>knowledge because “acclumuations” and </p><p>“areno” overcame me and I stopped up </p><p>my ears. </p><p> The fight progressed for twenty rounds</p><p>or more, when 1 began to doubt the ability </p><p>of Gans to win. Mr. Sullivan had a com- </p><p>missioner at the ringside, who, up to this </p><p>time, had been betting anybody and every- </p><p>body all the 10 to 6 that was wanted against </p><p>Nelson. I Hailed Mr. Sullivan at the ring- </p><p>side. </p><p> “This doesn’t look like the cinch for Gans</p><p>you said it would be,” I whispered. </p><p>.	-	' I</p><p>My Adventures with Y&amp;'ur'Money </p><p>* . t </p><p>203 </p><p> ‘•.Wait a minute,” Mr. Sullivan replied,</p><p>“I'D go to. Gans’ comer as soon as this </p><p>round is over and find out what’s doing </p><p>with him.” </p><p> Mr. Sullivan went over to Gans’ corner</p><p>'and came back. </p><p> "Gans says he can’t win this fight, but</p><p>he won’t lose. He’s a good ring-general and </p><p>he’ll pull us ■ out. Don’t bet any more </p><p>money. I’m going to stay close to the ring- </p><p>side. Watch close.” </p><p> It was apparent during the next ten</p><p>rounds that Gans was availing himself of </p><p>every opportunity to impress upon the </p><p>audience that Nelson was inclined to use </p><p>dirty fighting tactics, and soon Nelson was </p><p>being hooted for foul fighting. Gans, on </p><p>the other hand, appeared to be fighting </p><p>,Zair and like a gentleman. Soon it was evi- </p><p>j dent that Gans had won the sympathy and </p><p>favor of the audience. </p><p> The fight had continued through the</p><p>fortieth round, when Mr. Sullivan again </p><p>repaired to Gans’ corner and held another </p><p>animated whispered conversation with him. </p><p> In the forty-second round Gans of a</p><p>sudden went down, rolled over and, hold- </p><p>ing his hand under his belt, let out a yell of </p><p>anguish that indicated to the excited multi- </p><p>tude that Nelson had fouled him fright- </p><p>fully. </p><p> In another instant Mr. Sullivan had</p><p>ciambered into the ring. Confusion reigned. </p><p>The audience was on its feet. Pushing hi? </p><p>fist into the referee’s face, Mr. Sullivan </p><p>cried: “Now, Siler, you saw that foul, </p><p>didn’t you? It’s a foul, isn’t it? Gans wins, </p><p>doesn’t he?” </p><p> All of this happened quick as a flash.</p><p>Mr. Siler, pale as a ghost, whispered some-</p><p>thing inaudibly. </p><p> Mr. Sullivan, turning to the assemblage</p><p>and raising both arms to the skies, yelled: </p><p>“Gentlemen, the referee declares Gans </p><p>the winner on a foul!” </p><p> The audience acclaimed his decision with</p><p>salvos of applause. There did not appear </p><p>to be a man in the crow'd who doubted a </p><p>.oul had been committed, although Nelson </p><p>i.t once protested his innocence. </p><p> Next day Mr. Sullivan told me that in</p><p>or near the twenty-fourth round Gans had </p><p>broken his wrist and knew he could not win </p><p>:he fight by a knockout. He also said that </p><p>Gans went down in the forty-second round </p><p>in order to save the day, </p><p> ‘7 v&lt;&gt;! 1 that fight” sairi Mr. Sullivan.</p><p>“I told Gans while he was- in his corner </p><p>after the fortieth round that if he lost he </p><p>would be laying down on his friends, thal </p><p>he had the audience with him-, and that il </p><p>was time to take advantage of Nelson’.- </p><p>foul tactics.” </p><p> This was my first experience in prize-</p><p>fighting, and my last. My sympathies </p><p>were, however, with the winner. Gans' </p><p>tactics throughout up to the'last round wen- </p><p>gentlemanly and those of Nelson unfair. </p><p>Even the partisans of Nelson who had </p><p>wagered on him agreed after the fight thal </p><p>the battle put up by the negro up to the </p><p>forty-second round was a white man’s </p><p>fight and he was entitled to win. </p><p> Nelson had been guilty of foul tactics in</p><p>almost every round, but the probabilities </p><p>are that Gans was not disabled by a foul </p><p>blow in the forty-second round and that he </p><p>took advantage of the sentiment in his </p><p>favor, which had been created by his manly </p><p>battle up to that time, to go down at a </p><p>psychological moment. ■ </p><p> I saw Mr. Siler after the contest, and he</p><p>appeared pleased that his decision was so </p><p>well received, but he assured me that if he </p><p>was invited to referee another bout in any </p><p>mining camp he would decline the job. </p><p>[S|||pl THE Sullivan Trust Company, 01 </p><p>|1|||S course, won a big bet on the result, </p><p> but it lost a bigger one as an out-</p><p>come of the battle on the very next day. </p><p>The impression created by Announcer Sulli- </p><p>van’s attempt to reach lofty flights of elo- </p><p>quence in his speech to the fight-audience </p><p>was bad for the trust company, and il </p><p>required the use of over $100,000 on the day </p><p>following to meet the flood of selling orders </p><p>in Sullivan stocks which poured into the </p><p>San Francisco Stock Exchange.</p><p> THE YEAR OF BIO FIGURES</p><p>I SOON recouped these stock-market losses </p><p>At about four o’clock one afternoon, a </p><p>few days afterward, a miner who had been al </p><p>work during the day on the Loftus-Sweeney </p><p>lease of the Combination Fraction, called at </p><p>the office of the trust company and asked </p><p>me to buy 1,000 shares of Combination </p><p>Fraction stock for him. He divulged to me </p><p>that just as he was coming off shift he had </p><p>learned that a prodigious strike of high- </p><p>grade ore had been made at depth. Com- </p><p>bination Fraction had closed that afveraoor. </p><p>204 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>on the San Francisco Stock Exchange with </p><p>sales at $1.15. I went out on the street and </p><p>proceeded to buy all the Combination Frac- </p><p>tion in sight. In half an hour I had cor- </p><p>ralled about 60,000 shares at an average of </p><p>$1.30. An hour later the owners of the </p><p>lease obtained the information on which I </p><p>was working, and by eight o’clock that </p><p>night, when the Goldfield Stock Exchange </p><p>began its evening session, the price had </p><p>jumped to $1.85. Within a week there- </p><p>after the price skyrocketed to $3.75, and at </p><p>this figure I took profits of nearly $150,000. </p><p>Had I held on a little longer I could have </p><p>doubled that profit, for Combination Frac- </p><p>tion a few weeks later sold at higher </p><p>than $6.	*-</p><p> The Combination Fraction strike was fol-</p><p>lowed by a number of others, and the boom </p><p>gathered force. By October, Goldfield Sil- </p><p>ver Pick had advanced to $1 per share, up </p><p>600 per cent. Goldfield Red Top was sell- </p><p>ing at $2, Jumbo at $2, and Mohawk at $5, </p><p>showing profits of from 2,000 to 5,000 per </p><p>cent. Others had gained proportionately, </p><p>in fact, there were over twenty Goldfield </p><p>securities listed on the exchange that showed </p><p>the public a stock-market profit of anywhere </p><p>from 100 per cent, to 5,000 per cent. </p><p> Mining machinery of every description</p><p>was being shipped into camp, and for half </p><p>a mile around the Combination mine the </p><p>landscape of assembled gallows-frames re- </p><p>sembled a great producing oil field. There </p><p>were signs of mining activity everywhere. </p><p>For four miles east of the Combination </p><p>mine and six miles south every inch of ground </p><p>had been located. Claims situated miles </p><p>away from the productive area were chang- </p><p>ing hands hourly at high figures. </p><p> The Sullivan stocks kept pace in the</p><p>markets with the other booming securities, </p><p>and it was plain that the trust company</p><p>was riding on a tidal wave of success. Our </p><p>profits exceeded $1,500,000 at this period, </p><p>and we were just eight months old. </p><p> In quick succession the Sullivan Trust</p><p>Company promoted the Lou Dillon Gold- </p><p>field Mining Company at 25 cents per share, </p><p>a valuation of $250,000 for the property, </p><p>which cost $50,000; and the Silver Pick Ex- </p><p>tension, which cost $25,000, at the same </p><p>figure, netting several hundred thousand </p><p>dollars’ profit on these two transactions. </p><p>Options to purchase the Lou Dillon and </p><p>Silver Pick Extension, which were' situated </p><p>within 500 feet of the Combination mine.. </p><p>had been in possession of the Sullivan Trust </p><p>Company for months, and had increased in </p><p>value to such an extent that- on the day </p><p>the subscriptions were opened in Goldfield </p><p>for Lou Dillon at 25 cents per share, a pros- </p><p>pector named Phoenix, who had received </p><p>$50,000 from the Sullivan Trflst Company </p><p>for the entire property, subscribed for </p><p>100,000	shares, or a tenth interest in the</p><p>enterprise, paying $25,000 therefor. </p><p> It was the rule of the Sullivan Trust Com-</p><p>pany to open subscriptions in Goldfield on </p><p>the day its advertising copy left the camp by </p><p>mail for the East. Newspapet publishers </p><p>were always instructed to publjsh the adver- </p><p>tisements, which were generally of the full- </p><p>page variety, on the day following receipt. </p><p>In the case of Lou Dillon if became neces- </p><p>sary to telegraph all newspapers east of </p><p>Chicago not to publish .the advertisement </p><p>because of oversubscription before the copy </p><p>reached them, and in th,e c&amp;ge;of Silver Pick </p><p>Extension the orders to publish-the adver- </p><p>tisements were canceled by telegraph before </p><p>the mail carrying the copy reached Kansas </p><p>City. San Francisco, Los Angeles and Salt </p><p>Lake subscribed for 50 per cent.-of the en- </p><p>tire offering of Lou Dillon'and Silver Pick </p><p>Extension, and Goldfield for 25 per cent. </p><p>As a matter of fact, had we desired,w« could </p><p>have sold the entire offerings in Goldfield, </p><p>Tonopah and Reno without inserting any </p><p>advertisements, so great was the excite- </p><p>ment in the State itself. </p><p> At this period the combined monthly</p><p>payrolls of the mining companies promoted </p><p>by the Sullivan Trust Company totaled in </p><p>excess of $50,000, and the properties were </p><p>reaching a forward state of development. </p><p>IT WAS early Autumn in Goldfield, </p><p>warm, dry and dusty, and never a </p><p>cloud in the sky. I was at my desk </p><p>eighteen hours a day, and liked my job. </p><p>Things were coming our way.</p><p> The Sullivan Trust Company was in poli-</p><p>tics. Mr. Sullivan was popular with the </p><p>miners, and Governor Sparks -was a large </p><p>asset of the trust company because he had </p><p>been allowing the use of his name' as presi </p><p>dent of the mining companies promoted by </p><p>it. Nevertheless, when the State election </p><p>approached, the Governor had no money for </p><p>campaign expenses. He telegraphed the </p><p>trust company from Carson: </p><p> '*•1 will not stand for renomination."</p><p> We replied: “You are certain tc be</p><p>My Adventures with Yaur-'Money </p><p>205 </p><p>elected, and you will be renominated by </p><p>acclamation if you accept.” </p><p> "I woi^’t run unless you guarantee my</p><p>election,” he telegraphed. </p><p> We answered: “We guarantee.”</p><p> The Governor was renominated by the</p><p>Democrats. The Republicans placed in </p><p>nomination J. F. Mitchell, a mining engi- </p><p>neer and mine owner, who was very popu- </p><p>lar among mining men. </p><p> There were thousands of miners domi-</p><p>ciled in Goldfield. The Western Federation </p><p>of Miners dominated. </p><p> ‘-•Sullivan,” I said, “isn’t it a cinch these</p><p>miners will vote the Democratic ticket be- </p><p>cause Mitchell has been put forward by the </p><p>mine owners? Is it necessary to spend any </p><p>money "with the Western Federation?” </p><p>“Not a dollar!” replied Mr. Sullivan. </p><p>“There’s a fne’eting of the executive com- </p><p>mittee tO-morrow. I’m going to be around </p><p>when they meet. Without spending a dol- </p><p>lar I’ll bring home the bacon. Watch me! ” </p><p>Sullivan reported to me the next day </p><p>that he. had'succeeded in his mission. </p><p> “I didn!t attend the meeting,” he said,</p><p>“but I did see the main ‘squeeze.’ He told </p><p>me that a contribution to the Miner’s </p><p>Hospital would be gratefully accepted, but </p><p>that eyen that was not necessary, and that </p><p>Sparks would win in a walk.” </p><p> The only campaign money advanced by</p><p>the Sullivan Trust Company was given to </p><p>Mrv Sullivan to go to Reno. He asked for </p><p>$1,000, and he used it in conducting open </p><p>house on the first floor of the Golden Hotel, </p><p>meeting people and greeting them. Reno </p><p>appeared to be a Republican stronghold, </p><p>and Mr. Sullivan, by baiting the Catholics </p><p>against the Protestants, succeeded in hold- </p><p>ing down the Republican majority to an </p><p>extent that was wofully insufficient to </p><p>overcome the. Democratic majority rolled </p><p>up in Goldfield with the aid of the miners.</p><p>Governor Sparks was reelected by a hand- </p><p>some majority. Had the occasion de- </p><p>manded it, we would have “tapped a bar- </p><p>rel.” But it was not necessary. </p><p>THE STOKY OT GOLDFIELD CONSOLIDATED </p><p>RUMORS were rife in Goldfield of a mer- </p><p>ger of mammoth proportions which </p><p>• as said to be on the tapis. Great -as were </p><p>the gold discoveries in camp, they did not </p><p>ustify the terrific advances being chroni- </p><p>cled in the stock-market, and it was appar- </p><p>ent that something extraordinary must be </p><p>hatching to justify the market’s action. </p><p> George Wingfield, who, had enjoyed a</p><p>meteoric career, rising within.fiye years </p><p>from a faro dealer in Tonopa^ to the-«svner7 </p><p>ship of control in the Mohawk and many </p><p>other mining companies and to part owner- </p><p>ship of the leading Goldfield bank, John S. </p><p>Cook &amp; Company, which was then credited </p><p>with having $7,000,000 on deposit, was said </p><p>to be engineering the deal. The names of </p><p>the properties were not given, nor the fig- </p><p>ures. It occurred to me that in any merger </p><p>that was made the Jumbo and Red Top, </p><p>because of their central location, must be </p><p>included. I sought out Charles D. Taylor, </p><p>who with his brother, H. L. Taylor, and </p><p>Capt. J. B. Menardi, owned the control of </p><p>these properties. He asked $2.50 per share </p><p>for his stock and that of his partners—all </p><p>or none. Mr. Taylor had walked into the </p><p>camp as a prospector. Most of his nights </p><p>were spent at the gaming tables, and he was </p><p>reported to be an easy mark for profes- </p><p>sional gamblers. I put Mr. Sullivan on his </p><p>trail. Mr. Sullivan reported to me that </p><p>Mr. Wingfield was hobnobbing with Mr. </p><p>Taylor. </p><p> “Get an option on these properties from</p><p>Taylor,” I told Mr. Sullivan. </p><p>NEXT morning I met Mr. Sullivan. </p><p>He held in his hands 20,000 shares </p><p>of Jumbo, selling at $1.75 per share </p><p>on the Goldfield Stock Exchange. </p><p> “I won it in a poker game last night with</p><p>Taylor and Wingfield,” he said. “I have </p><p>an oral option on the property good for </p><p>three days at $2.50, but if you leave it to </p><p>me, I’ll win these properties from him play- </p><p>ing cards.” </p><p> I	did not see Mr. Sullivan again for a</p><p>week. Next I heard of him he had “fallen </p><p>off the water-wagon” and was reported to </p><p>be celebrating the event in Tonopah. While </p><p>Mr. Sullivan was “kidding” himself about </p><p>his poker-playing ability, Mr. Wingfield </p><p>had come to terms with Mr. Taylor and</p><p>had bought the control of Jumbo and Red </p><p>Top at an average price of $2.10 per share. </p><p>That explained Mr. Sullivan’s lapse. How- </p><p>ever, I blamed myself. Mr. Sullivan was </p><p>no match for Mr. Wingfield. In any game </p><p>from stud-poker to fitting a pistol-duel </p><p>Mr. Wingfield can outwit, outmaneuver </p><p>and outgeneral a hundred like “Larry.” </p><p>Both companies had been capitalized </p><p>206 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>for i,000,000-shares, The sale required </p><p>that a fortune be paid over. Mr. Wing- </p><p>field paid a small sum down, and Mr. Tay- </p><p>lor placed the stock of both of these com- </p><p>panies in escrow in the Johfi S. Cook &amp; </p><p>Company bank, the balance to be paid a </p><p>month later. </p><p>The purchase of control of the </p><p>Jumbo and Red Top by the firm of </p><p>Wingfield and Nixon signalized the </p><p>beginning of a stock-market campaign for </p><p>higher prices that stands unprecedented </p><p>:?or intensity in the history of mining-stock </p><p>speculation in this country since the great </p><p>boom of the Comstock lode in 1871-1872. </p><p> The market for all listed Goldfield stocks</p><p>was made to boil and sizzle day in and day </p><p>out until Jumbo and Red Top had been </p><p>ballooned from $2 to $5 per share, Laguna </p><p>from 40 cents to $2, Goldfield Mining from </p><p>50 cents to $2, and Mohawk from $5 to </p><p>$20. Within three weeks the advance in </p><p>market price of the issued capitalization </p><p>of this quintet alone represented the differ- </p><p>ence between $8,000,000 and $26,500,000. </p><p> A few days before top prices were reached,</p><p>it was officially announced that the merger </p><p>of Mohawk, Red Top, Jumbo, Goldfield </p><p>Mining and Laguna into the Goldfield Con- </p><p>solidated Mines Company had been made </p><p>on the basis of $20 for each outstanding </p><p>share of Mohawk, $5 for Red Top, $5 for </p><p>Jumbo, $2 for Goldfield Mining, and $2 for </p><p>Laguna. It was also given out that the </p><p>promoters, Wingfield and Nixon, had al- </p><p>ioted themselves $2,500,000 in stock of the </p><p>merged companies as a promoters’ fee. </p><p>Right on top of this came an announcement </p><p>that the Combination mine had been turned </p><p>into the merger for $4,000,000 in cash and </p><p>stock, and it was learned that go-betweens </p><p>had made a profit of $1,000,000 on the deal </p><p>:-;y securing an option on the property for </p><p>$.3,000,000. </p><p> In short, a merger was put through of</p><p>properties and stocks, the issued capitaliza- </p><p>tion of which was selling in the markets on</p><p>the day the merger was conceived for </p><p>Sxi,ooo,ooo, at a valuation of $33,000,000, </p><p>and in addition the promoters received </p><p>S2,500,000	for their “services.” Had the</p><p>properties been merged on the basis of their </p><p>selling prices three weeks prior, the equiva- </p><p>lent value of the 3,500,000 shares of merger </p><p>stock would have been a fraction above </p><p>$3. As it stood, under the ballooning proc- </p><p>ess, the market value was $10, which was </p><p>the par. </p><p> At the time of the merger these were the</p><p>conditions that ruled at the mines: </p><p> The Mohawk, appraised at $20,000,000,</p><p>had produced under lease in the neighbor- </p><p>hood of $8,000,000, of which less than </p><p>$2,000,000 had found its way into the treasury </p><p>of the Mohawk Mining Company, the bal- </p><p>ance going to the leasers. The leasers had </p><p>“high-graded” the property to a fare-you- </p><p>well, and less than $r,000,000 worth of high- </p><p>grade remained in sight, although it was </p><p>conceded on every side that the leasers had </p><p>not attempted, nor were they able during </p><p>the period of their leasehold, to block out </p><p>systematically and put into sight all of the </p><p>ore in the mine. Large, but indefinite, </p><p>prospective value therefore attached to Mo- </p><p>hawk in addition to the tonnage in sight. </p><p> The Laguna, for which $2,000,000 had</p><p>been paid in stock, did not have a pound of </p><p>ore in sight, and there were no indications </p><p>that it would ever have any. </p><p> Coldfield Mining, scene of a sensational</p><p>production during the early days of the </p><p>camp, appraised at $2,000,000 more, had </p><p>fizzled out as a producer. </p><p> Jumbo, taken in for $5,000,000, for a year</p><p>previous had produced little or no ore, most </p><p>of the time being exhausted by the manage- </p><p>ment in sinking a deep shaft, and it had less </p><p>than $500,000 in sight. </p><p> Red Top, valued at another $5,000,000,</p><p>had in excess of $2,000,000 worth of medium </p><p>grade ore blocked out. </p><p> Wingfield and Nixon were also heavily</p><p>interested in Columbia Mountain, Sand- </p><p>storm, Blue "Bull, Crackerjack, Red Hills, </p><p>Oro, Booth, Milltown, Kendall, May Queen, </p><p>and other Goldfield stocks. No sooner did </p><p>the five stocks forming the merger begin to </p><p>show such startling market advances than </p><p>the ballooning tendency manifested itself in </p><p>Wingfield and Nixon’s miscellaneous list, </p><p>and all of them showed phenomenal gains. </p><p>Soon the entire list of Goldfield, Tonopah, </p><p>Manhattan, Bullfrog, and other Nevada </p><p>mining securities listed on the San Fran-</p><p>cisco Stock Exchange and traded in on the </p><p>exchanges and curbs of the country, felt the </p><p>force of the terrific rises, and sympatheti- </p><p>cally they skyrocketed to unheard-of </p><p>levels. </p><p> To convey an idea as to how far the prices</p><p>of these stocks were moved up beyond their </p><p>intrinsic worth, as a result of the balloon- </p><p>My Adventures with. Your Money </p><p>207 </p><p>ing process of the merger, I give some </p><p>comparisons. </p><p> Columbia Mountain sold during the boom</p><p>at above §1.50; it is now selling at 5 cents. </p><p>Blue Bull, Crackerjack, Oro, Booth, Red </p><p>Hills, Milltown, Kendall, Conqueror, Hi- </p><p>ll	emia, Ethel, Kewanas, Sandstorm and</p><p>May- Queen sold at an average of 75 cents </p><p>during the boom; they are now selling at an </p><p>average of less than 5 cents. A hundred </p><p>other Goldfield securities, which were in </p><p>eager demand at the zenith of the spectacu- </p><p>lar movement at prices ranging from 50 </p><p>cents to $2.50 can now be purchased at from </p><p>1 to s cents per share, while many others </p><p>that were hopefully bought by an over- </p><p>wrought public at all sorts of figures are now </p><p>not quoted at all. </p><p>AT THE HEIGHT OF THE FRENZY </p><p>THE difference between the market price </p><p>of listed Nevada stocks on November </p><p>15, 1906, and that of to-day is in excess of </p><p>$200,000,000. A fair estimate of the pub- </p><p>lic’s real-money loss in the listed division </p><p>is $150,000,000. </p><p> Nor was this all of the damage that</p><p>was done. Vftien excitement in Goldfield’s </p><p>listed stocks reached a frenzy, wild-cat- </p><p>ters operating from the cities got into </p><p>harness, and within three months in the </p><p>neighborhood of 2,000 companies, owning </p><p>in most instances properties situated miles </p><p>from the proved zone in Goldfield, or </p><p>in unproved camps near Goldfield, were </p><p>foisted on the public for $150,000,000 </p><p>more. </p><p> The fact that Mohawk, which in the</p><p>early days of Goldfield could have been pur- </p><p>chased at 10 cents, had advanced to $20 and </p><p>had shown purchasers a profit of 20,000 per </p><p>cent.; that Laguna had advanced in less </p><p>than.two years from 15 cents to $2; that </p><p>Jumbo and Red Top, selling at $5, could </p><p>have been purchased a year or two before </p><p>at around 10 cents; that Goldfield Mining, </p><p>which had in the early days been peddled </p><p>around the camp at 15 cents, had moved up </p><p>to $2, etc., gaye the wild-catters an argu-</p><p>ment that was convincing to gulls in every </p><p>town and hamlet in the Union. And the </p><p>harvest was immense. Not one of the </p><p>2,000	wild-cats has made good, and every</p><p>dollar invested has been lost. </p><p> U will be noted from the reckoning as</p><p>given that about as much'money was lost </p><p>in the listed stocks of the camps' as in the </p><p>unlisted “cats and dogs.” </p><p> As a matter of fact, veteran mining-stock</p><p>buyers, in camp and out 6f the camp, lost </p><p>as much hard cash as did‘.felje unsophisti- </p><p>cated. San Francisco, which owes its </p><p>opulence of years gone by to successful </p><p>mining endeavor, was probably hit as hard </p><p>as any other city in the Union. San Fran- </p><p>cisco thought it knew the game, and it con- </p><p>fined its operations to the stocks listed on </p><p>the exchange where the Comstocks are </p><p>traded in. But San Francisco did not know </p><p>the inside of the merger deal as it is now </p><p>known to every schoolboy in Nevada. </p><p> The operation on the inside was this.</p><p>Wingfield and Nixon owned the John S. </p><p>Cook &amp; Company bank in Goldfield, and </p><p>they owned the control of a number of min- </p><p>ing companies which were of little or nc </p><p>account as well as having acquired the con- </p><p>trol of the biggest mine in camp. During </p><p>the height of the boom, which they engi- </p><p>neered to swing the merger, they disposed of </p><p>millions of shares of an indiscriminate lot of </p><p>companies, and used the proceeds to take </p><p>over Jumbo and Red Top and to take up </p><p>their outstanding contracts in Mohawk and </p><p>other integrals of the merger. They like- </p><p>wise were able during the ballooning proc- </p><p>ess to dispose of much Mohawk at from </p><p>$15 to $20, much Jumbo at from $4 to $5, </p><p>much Red Top at from $4 to $5, that cost </p><p>them very considerably less than this, and </p><p>in this way were enabled to finance their </p><p>deal to a finish. </p><p> I have just pointed out that in order to</p><p>accomplish the merger it was necessary that </p><p>the market in all Goldfield securities, in </p><p>which the promoters were interested, be </p><p>stimulated in order to enable unloading by </p><p>the insiders before some of the very large </p><p>payments became due. This being accom- </p><p>plished, and the payments having been </p><p>made, the promoters sought to establish a </p><p>market for merger shares at or around par. </p><p>In order to accomplish this the Goldfield </p><p>bank, in which the promoters were heav- </p><p>ily interested, stimulated speculation and </p><p>managed to spread a feeling of security by </p><p>announcing its willingness to loan from 60</p><p>to 80 per cent, of par on merger shares. </p><p> All Goldfield fell for this, and the camp</p><p>went broke as a result. </p><p> Within eighteen months thereafter Gold-</p><p>field Consolidated sold down to $3.50 in the </p><p>markets, and margin-traders and borrowers </p><p>208 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>who had y it up the stock as collateral to </p><p>purchase more were butchered. The stock </p><p>has since paid $3.50 in dividends. Its </p><p>recent “low” in the market was S5.50 per </p><p>share, and its “high” $7 a share. </p><p> It must be evident that Wingfield and</p><p>Nixon, both of whom are multimillionaires </p><p>as the result of their mining-stock operations </p><p>in Goldfield, were directly and indirectly </p><p>important factors in the loss by the public </p><p>of $300,000,000, as set forth above. It is </p><p>admitted that less than $7,000,000 worth of </p><p>ore had been developed as a reserve at the </p><p>time $35,000,000 worth of stock in the </p><p>merger was issued and a market manufac- </p><p>tured to hold the stock at this fictitious </p><p>price-level. It is not of particular interest </p><p>that Goldfield Consolidated, by reason of </p><p>sensationally rich mine developments at </p><p>depth, has since given promise of returning </p><p>to stockholders an amount almost equal to </p><p>par for their shares, and that it now appears </p><p>that those who were able to weather the </p><p>intervening declines may in the end be out </p><p>only the interest on their money. </p><p> This is also evident: Goldfield Con-</p><p>solidated stockholders had two chances </p><p>at the outset. They could break even or </p><p>lose—break even on their investment if </p><p>the mine made good in a sensational way, </p><p>which was a big gamble at the time, or </p><p>lose if the mine didn’t. They could notjwin. </p><p> Mr. Nixon is a United States Senator</p><p>from Nevada. He is also president of the </p><p>Nixon National Bank of Reno, Nevada, </p><p>lie held both of these positions at the time </p><p>the merger was made, and it was largely </p><p>because of Mr. Nixon’s political and finan- </p><p>cial position that the daring market opera- </p><p>tions of the mergerers which led up to the </p><p>merger proved so successful. </p><p> In the Nevada Mining News of May 25,</p><p>1907, circulation 28,000, an interview ap- </p><p>peared with United States Senator Nixon of </p><p>Nevada, vouched for as follows: </p><p> The manuscript of the interview was submitted</p><p>to, and approved by, the Senator. Unchanged by </p><p>one jot or tittle, it is printed just as it came from </p><p>his hands. Even now the Senator holds a carbon </p><p>of the original manuscript and may brand us"with</p><p>it if we have broken the faith we pledged. </p><p> I quote from the Senator’s interview, as</p><p>it appeared in that issue of the Nevada Min- </p><p>ing News: </p><p> “ What do you estimate the ultimate earnings of</p><p>Goldfield Consolidated will be?” was asked. </p><p> “ Consolidated will be a bigger producer, I should</p><p>say, three or four years from now than it will be </p><p>one year from now,” Senator Nixon replied, “ and I </p><p>believe I am conservative when I say that the </p><p>property will be eventually earning $1,000,000 net </p><p>monthly.” </p><p> “Then, as an investment, the stock is</p><p>easily a $20 stock?” </p><p> “That is a minimum estimate of its</p><p>future value, I should say,” was the </p><p>response. </p><p> As to that interview:</p><p> Mr. Nixon said that within three or foui</p><p>years (the time limit is up), $20 would be </p><p>a minimum price for the 'shares. Thej </p><p>touched $10 only once since then, or one- </p><p>half of his estimate. Shortly after the inter- </p><p>view was given they sold down as low as $3.50. </p><p> He said, further, that the mines would</p><p>ultimately earn at the rate of $1,000,000 </p><p>a month. This statement also has fallen </p><p>far short of fulfilment. </p><p> Since George S. Nixon, as president of the</p><p>Goldfield Consolidated Company, gave this </p><p>interview, according to his own statement, </p><p>he has disposed of all of his holdings, and at </p><p>an average price, it is believed, of less than </p><p>$8 a share. </p><p> This is only a superficial rendering of the</p><p>big event in Goldfield’s history, but it is </p><p>sufficient to furnish an example of the effect </p><p>of Get-Rich-Quick influences that radiate </p><p>from high places and separate the public </p><p>from millions upon millions, without being </p><p>called to account. </p><p> The dear American *public has been</p><p>falling for this kind of insidious brand of </p><p>Get-Rich-Quick dope for years. It is being </p><p>gulled into losing millions through its fetish </p><p>worship of promoters with millions, who are </p><p>really the Get-Rich-Quicks of the day that </p><p>are dangerous. </p><p> Greenwater, a rich man’s camp, in which</p><p>the public sank from $20,000,000 to $30,- </p><p>000,000 during three months that marked </p><p>the zenith of the Goldfield boom, is another </p><p>case in point where a confiding investing </p><p>public followed a deceiving light and was </p><p>led to ruthless slaughter. </p><p> (The public’s loss of $30,000,000 in</p><p>Greenwater mining stocks, the terrific </p><p>crash that followed in Goldfield stocks,</p><p>the loss by the Sullivan Trust Company </p><p>of $3,000,000 in three weeks, and the </p><p>great Rawhide, Nevada, stampede, in </p><p>which 30,000 people crossed the desert, </p><p>of whom 12,000 remained and made the </p><p>camp their abode for months, will be told </p><p>by Mr. Rice in the July number.) </p><p>^ DONAL HAMILTON HAINES </p><p>FICE </p><p>THE </p><p>SAC </p><p> HERE was one flat cap above a</p><p>jutting rock three hundred yards </p><p>away at which Jenks had been </p><p>shooting fruitlessly for half an </p><p>hour. Thirty-^two times he had fired, he dis- </p><p>covered by an examination of the empty </p><p>ioops in his cartridge-belt, and six times he </p><p>had been rewarded by seeing the flat cap </p><p>disappear. But always it reappeared in the </p><p>same place, and always a bullet zumtned </p><p>through the air above Jenks’ head or </p><p>whanged into the ground to one side or the </p><p>other of him. </p><p> He felt a deepening animosity against</p><p>the wearer of that flat cap. This unknown </p><p>might have the grace to get in the way of </p><p>one of Jenks’ bullets, or send one of his own </p><p>into Jenks’ vitals! That at least would put </p><p>an abrupt end to this endless lining of sights </p><p>and pulling of trigger. At the present rate </p><p>it could result only in Jenks’ running out </p><p>of cartridges and being forced to crawl back </p><p>uncomfortably to where there might be </p><p>more. Three months’ enlightening experi- </p><p>ence had convinced Jenks that extra ammu- </p><p>nition was always hard to find when it was </p><p>most to be desired. He did not go out of </p><p>his way to lay this up against the gigantic </p><p>system of which he formed a part, but ac- </p><p>cepted it as another galling fact in a chain </p><p>of unpleasant realities which went to make </p><p>up an unsatisfactory universe. </p><p> “ Why don’t you 'stick your hat up on the</p><p>end of your bayonet and see if you can't </p><p>make that chap break cover? ” suggested a </p><p>mild voice in Jenks’ ear. </p><p> The private looked around to see a man</p><p>in drab clothes, a slouch hat and spiral put- </p><p>tees lying prone on the earth behind him. </p><p>He recognized him as one of the war-corre- </p><p>spondents whom the army was kept busy </p><p>chasing away from the front, where they </p><p>could really see things and so write authen- </p><p>tic reports of what was going on. </p><p> “Well, in the first place,” Jenks answered</p><p>argumentatively, “I don’t want that hat </p><p>shot full of holes. It’s a good hat, and now</p><p>and then it rains in this country!” </p><p> After saying which he sniffed in high dis-</p><p>dain and proceeded to follow the other’s ad- </p><p>vice, employing a chance stick instead of </p><p>his bayonet for the purpose. The strata- </p><p>gem succeeded. The first indications of </p><p>success were so violent that the war-corre- </p><p>spondent curled up his long legs and hugged </p><p>the ground closer. For the owner of the </p><p>flat cap rattled a magazine full of shots </p><p>through the air around Jenks’ hat, then, </p><p>failing to hit it, he rose to his full height for </p><p>a better shot, sent the hat skimming through </p><p>the air, and got one of the .30 caliber, </p><p>nickel-jacketed bullets from Jenks’ rifle </p><p>squarely in the pit of the stomach. Jenks </p><p>and the journalist witnessed the fall of the </p><p>man in the flat cap with quiet enthusiasm. </p><p> “Through the middle, I ’low!” announced</p><p>Jenks. </p><p> “Very pretty!” complimented the drab-</p><p>clad man, and they relapsed into silence. </p><p>THERE might have been other flat </p><p>caps sticking above the gray rocks for </p><p>Jenks to shoot at, but he was in no </p><p>mood to hunt for them. He laid the rifle to </p><p>one side, wet his finger and laid it on the </p><p>barrel, which sizzled sharply. Jenks swore, </p><p>209 </p><p>.... </p><p>210 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>waved- his blistered finger and opened the </p><p>breech to let the air through the barrel more </p><p>freely. </p><p> “Thirty rounds and you could boil coffee</p><p>ou ’em!” he complained to the drab man. </p><p> The latter nodded agreeably and offered</p><p>Jenks a cigarfette from a leather case. Jenks </p><p>took it in: his big, brown, blunt-nailed fin- </p><p>gers and looked at it critically. </p><p> “Tryin’ to get a real smoke out of a</p><p>cigarette,” he averred, “is like tryin’ to </p><p>plow a forty-acre field with a penknife!” </p><p> The newspaper man laughed and</p><p>scratched a match on the sole of his boot. </p><p> “ You come off a farm? ” he asked casually.</p><p> Jenks stared at the end of his glowing</p><p>cigarette and ndQded soberly several times. </p><p> “And God knows why!" he added seri-</p><p>ously. </p><p> “Maybe you came because of the same</p><p>reason that drove me,” suggested the jour- </p><p>nalist. “I wanted to see w-hat this business </p><p>was like.” </p><p> The wagging of Jenks’ head was a de-</p><p>cided negative. </p><p> “Nope,” he^said, “I ain’t got no such</p><p>sized curiosity. I got cured o’ that when 1 </p><p>was a kid. ‘I wanted to see just how hard </p><p>a cow could kick! I found out all right, </p><p>and I can’t say I was any better off for </p><p>knowin.’ Nope, I didn’t care none what </p><p>war was like. I didn’t think it was goin’ to </p><p>be fun. I just sort of thought I ought to </p><p>go. Dunno why, ’zactly. Old Man White </p><p>come round and talked to a lot of us fellers </p><p>down at the corners ’bout our duty. ‘You </p><p>oughter go,’ he says. ‘It’s your country </p><p>callin’ ye, the place that give birth to ye, </p><p>the land of yer fathers! It’s yer duty!”’ </p><p> Jenks paused to snap the butt of Iris</p><p>cigarette at the stalk of a milkweed. </p><p> “Now me an’ the U-nited States ain’t</p><p>never got very close together,” he con- </p><p>tinued. “I alius felt that if either me or </p><p>the country died overnight we wouldn’t </p><p>notice it none if nobody told us. But Old </p><p>Man White kind o’ set me to thinkin’. I </p><p>never took no interest in politics; never </p><p>went out to vote—didn’t even enroll. AH </p><p>the U-nited States meant to me was an </p><p>eagle on the few dollars that come my way. </p><p>Old Man White used to tell me I ought to </p><p>be ashamed of myself. Said I wa’n’t no </p><p>citizen. Maybe he was right. Iwaskeepin’ </p><p>my woman an’ the kids fed an’ runnin’ my </p><p>farm, but that’s ’bout as far as my bein’ a </p><p>citizen did go, I guess.” </p><p> Jenks was interrupted again by the clat-</p><p>ter of a short-lived fusillade along another </p><p>portion of the thin skirmish-line, hidden by </p><p>a twist of the ridge. He raised his eyes from </p><p>the ground to w'atch the distant passage of </p><p>an officer’s patrol of cavalrymen in wide, </p><p>flapping hats. The. correspondent held out </p><p>the leather case again, and Jenks selected </p><p>another cigarette less critically. </p><p> “They’re so durned. small,” he said, as</p><p>though to apologize for smoking another, </p><p>“that a feller has to smoke another to re- </p><p>member what the last one tasted like! Yes. </p><p>I guess Old Man White drove me off here. </p><p>I got to thinkin’ ’bout things a whole lot, </p><p>and I just made up my mind that maybe </p><p>the debt was on my side. I hadn’t done </p><p>very much for the country, and I judged </p><p>from what I see in the papers that about a </p><p>hundred thousand chaps about my size an’ </p><p>age would come in pretty handy, so I sent </p><p>Millie an’ the kids to her folks an’ just come </p><p>along.” </p><p> He stopped abruptly, as though having</p><p>reached a natural conclusion, and sat star- </p><p>ing out at the hot ridge opposite, its tum- </p><p>bling, rugged rocks climbing high above thc-</p><p>level on which he sat. His companion </p><p>looked at him narrowly and shifted his </p><p>position on the warm earth. </p><p> “Glad you came?” the correspondent</p><p>asked lazily, chewing his words as he </p><p>shifted the cigarette to the other corner of </p><p>his mouth with his tongue so that he might </p><p>not have to move his hands. </p><p> “No,” answered Jenks with surprising</p><p>alacrity, “I ain’t! I hadn’t ought to have </p><p>done it. Three months, now, I’ve grubbed </p><p>around this landscape, shootin’ at people </p><p>I ain’t got nothin’ against, and gettin’ shot </p><p>at by them. Now there’s that chap a few </p><p>minutes back. I was layin’ for him same’s </p><p>I’ve laid for woodchucks. I was plain mad </p><p>at him for no reason’t all ’cept I couldn’t </p><p>hit him—an’ now he’s doubled up, and </p><p>maybe he’s got a wife an’ kids like mine. </p><p>But that ain’t the point! I ain’t sayin’ </p><p>nothin’ against this here war. Maybe it’s </p><p>all right; I dunno. nothin’ about it. But </p><p>I ain’t no business here; I ought ’a’ stayed </p><p>to home! Three months gone, an’ my </p><p>farm’s goin’ to rack. When I get back I’ll </p><p>hev t’ borrow money to get things squared </p><p>up, an’ it’ll take me the Lord’s own while </p><p>to pay it up. </p><p> “An’ I ain’t no real use, here! I ain’t</p><p>doin’ half as much good potterin’ round </p><p>The Sacrifice </p><p>211. </p><p>with this no-’count gun as 1 would be gettin’ </p><p>in my wheat. I ain’t no for-sure soldier; </p><p>it ain’t in me. I haven’t shirked none, but </p><p>I don’t like it. An’ them same U-nited </p><p>States wouldn’t miss me none if I lit out </p><p>right now. No, sir! if I could sneak past </p><p>that cussed little lieutenant I could go home </p><p>an' never be missed. But he’d see me, </p><p>sure!” </p><p> “You’d desert, then, if you could?”</p><p>asked the man in drab. </p><p> Jenks flared with sudden anger. “Not</p><p>by a-sight!” he snorted. “I ain’t that </p><p>sort. I come out for the war, an’ I’m goin’ </p><p>to stay!” </p><p> His companion nodded with a show of</p><p>understanding. There was a bundle -of </p><p>notes in his inside pocket which ought to </p><p>reach the ware, but they could wait a few </p><p>minutes. </p><p> “Well, suppose,” he persisted, “you had</p><p>the choice between doing some big thing to- </p><p>morrow—getting to the top of that ridge, </p><p>we’ll say, or going home, which would you </p><p>do?” </p><p> “Home with an honorable discharge?”</p><p>queried Jenks. </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> Jenks rubbed a stubbly chin an instant,</p><p>puckering his lips about the frayed end of </p><p>the cigarette. </p><p> “I’d go home!” he announced finally.</p><p>“Yeah, that’s what I’d do all right; I’d go </p><p>home. I know what you’re thinkin’, mister, </p><p>but just look a-here. I leave my farm an’ </p><p>people an’ come out here to go soldierin’. </p><p>Maybe I go through all right, then I go </p><p>back home, an’ what happens? Do I get </p><p>banquets an’ statues an’ such like? Un </p><p>huh! Not me! There’s too many of us. </p><p>I wear my army pants, to plow in, and </p><p>folks say: ‘There’s Bill Jenks usin’ up his </p><p>army clo’es. He was in the war. ’ That's all! </p><p> “An’ maybe I get shot; maybe it’s for</p><p>keeps, an’ then Millie an’ the kids is in for </p><p>it. Her folks ain’t got nothin’; she’d have </p><p>to work the rest of her days. Maybe I lose </p><p>an arm or a leg, an’ then what am I good </p><p>for? Nothin’, just nothin’ but settin’ </p><p>around in the sun an’ lettin’ her work for </p><p>me! Them's the chances 1 have to take, </p><p>an’ there ain’t nothin’ to set over ag’in </p><p>’em! They don’t need me here half’s much </p><p>as that gal an’ the kids does. There’s a </p><p>lot of chaps here could do Bill Jenks’ sol- </p><p>dierin’ lor him, but they couldn’t go back </p><p>zn’ run his farm. I ain’t needed! ” </p><p> He threw the butt of the second cigarette</p><p>at the same milkweed. </p><p> "Old Man White,” he concluded, “give*</p><p>me a rum go. I ain’t done my duty i ” </p><p> The newspaper man rolled Over and</p><p>started to crawl away to file his sketchy </p><p>despatches. He tossed Jenks a third cig- </p><p>arette as he prepared to go. </p><p> “Don’t try to figure it out,” he advised.</p><p>“That question is only about as old as the </p><p>institution of war—which is pretty average </p><p>hoary. Smoke another stick on it. So </p><p>long.” </p><p> “S’long!” answered Jenks, and watched</p><p>him crawl off through the grass. </p><p>IT WAS not on the cards thatfWi!-iam </p><p>Jenks should go in search of fresh </p><p>cartridges to fill the gaping loops in his </p><p>belt. His successful shot had been almost the </p><p>last of the long rambling skirmish which had </p><p>been but the prelude of the serious business </p><p>that was in the making. While Jenks was </p><p>still caressing the hot barrel of his rifle and </p><p>wondering what he could do with himself </p><p>until ordered to move in some direction, </p><p>the hills rocked under the first shocks of a </p><p>tremendous artillery duel. The thin skir-</p><p>mish-line of which Jenks formed a part wa.^ </p><p>enfolded by the great masses of dun-coloreo </p><p>infantry which swept up behind them, and </p><p>the whole mass was spread out in hollows </p><p>like great windrows, or sent trickling off </p><p>through steep, scrubby defiles while the </p><p>batteries thundered over their heads to cut </p><p>a way for them. </p><p> For days tired, wide-eyed officers had</p><p>studied the black line across the map which </p><p>stood for the ridge that Jenks and the </p><p>sun-baked skirmishers had watched. At </p><p>the end of those days the ways and means </p><p>for the taking of that ridge had been devised, </p><p>and the buttons at headquarters had been </p><p>pressed which sent all the scattered units of </p><p>the great army tumbling forward in appar- </p><p>ently aimless confusion. </p><p> While the black ridge became hazy with</p><p>the smoke of its defending batteries, and </p><p>scarred from the crashing explosions of </p><p>shells, the masses of dirty-looking infantry </p><p>edged and crept in from every side. As the </p><p>red flashes from the ridge batteries grew </p><p>fewer, and the officers, through their binoc- </p><p>ulars, could see the gun-teams (looking like </p><p>ants in the hazy distance) frantically drag- </p><p>ging the battered guns out of the rain of </p><p>shells, the movement of the brown waves </p><p>' 212 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>of infantry grew faster, more certain; un- </p><p>guessed lines and straggling blocks of men </p><p>sprang from cover; deep-slashed defiles </p><p>spouted forth brown columns, and the con- </p><p>verging waves washed and surged about the </p><p>loot of the black ridge. </p><p> Jenks found himself carried along in a</p><p>mad, frantic tumble up the same slopes </p><p>that he had grown so tired of watching. </p><p>For blurred, panting minutes he struggled </p><p>over slippery footing through saplings and </p><p>low bushes. The slope grew steeper, and he </p><p>found himself clutching at grass for sup- </p><p>port—grass so slender that he knew it </p><p>would not hold his weight, but which he </p><p>felt would help him an inch higher and so </p><p>make another inch possible. His breath </p><p>came shorter and shorter until it hurt his </p><p>laboring lungs sharply. The perspiration </p><p>streamed down his face and gathered in </p><p>uncomfortable pools under his eyebrows. </p><p>Above all other things he desired to lie </p><p>down and pant until he could regain his </p><p>breath, but the sight of other men—des- </p><p>perately tired as he was but still struggling </p><p>on—kept him at work. </p><p> As yet the fire of the enemy had not com-</p><p>menced to hunt them out. The crash of the </p><p>artillery was still loud in his ears, but the </p><p>beating volleys seemed still /on other slopes </p><p>of the ridge. Jenks’ breath began to come </p><p>more easily. The “second wind” had </p><p>caught him when he needed it most, and he </p><p>found that his brain was now capable of </p><p>considering something besides the placing </p><p>of his feet and the stabbing of the air at his </p><p>chest. </p><p> He wondered hazily why he was racking</p><p>■he very heart out of him in this mad rush </p><p>up a dark mountain. At the top he would </p><p>only kill more men in flat caps—if he ever </p><p>reached the top. He thought of the man he </p><p>Iiad shot, and no longer felt a species of </p><p>nausea at the remembrance of the dark, </p><p>still figure hanging over the rock with such </p><p>pathetic limpness. </p><p> He glanced hastily at the other men</p><p>around him. They were all strangers; in </p><p>the rush of the attack he had become sepa- </p><p>rated from the men of his own company. </p><p>Yet he felt no unease, no panicky desire to </p><p>find the familiar figures with which he had </p><p>toiled and fought for three months. These </p><p>f-ushed, hot, eager faces about him were not </p><p>strange, after all. He knew that he must </p><p>look very much like them at the moment. </p><p>And they were just plain, ordinary men like </p><p>himself, with tilings waiting for them at </p><p>home. They had no more desire than he </p><p>to reach the top of the hill and go stabbing </p><p>with their bayonets among those dark- </p><p>skinned men in the flat caps! </p><p> And yet they went—ran with all the</p><p>strength of mind and body, as though reach- </p><p>ing the crest were the one thing in life to be </p><p>done. Aye, a thing greater than life itself., </p><p>for all of these men would not reach the top. </p><p> Jenks had always been careful of himself.</p><p>He had been commended by his officers for </p><p>his ability to take cover and keep under it </p><p>without damaging his usefulness. Well, he </p><p>had not wanted to die. He had feared death </p><p>as a healthy man with a deep, unanalyzed </p><p>joy in mere animal life does. And these </p><p>other men around him were as he was; he </p><p>felt perfectly sure of that. And yet they </p><p>went now to certain death without that </p><p>fear which he knew must have been strong </p><p>within them. Some greater thing than </p><p>fear, some greater tiling than the love of </p><p>life was driving them. </p><p> A shell ripped through the upper branches</p><p>of a tree and burst with a crash that set the </p><p>very centers of his being to twitching. An- </p><p>other followed it, and then the woods were</p><p>raked mercilessly by the screeching gusts of </p><p>shrapnel. The men about Jenks did not </p><p>pause nor look. Some of them sprawled </p><p>heavily to the earth and lay still; others </p><p>fell but did not lie still, and their screams </p><p>and cries mingled with the racket of the </p><p>firing. The bullets came now, too, whipping </p><p>through the leaves and branches, plowing </p><p>into the earth, keeping up their high-pitched </p><p>music—like the sharp twanging of big wires </p><p>in the air overhead. </p><p> Through the thinning trunks of the trees</p><p>the bare surface of the crest showed, bend- </p><p>ing up toward the skyline in a sharper curve </p><p>Already its black surface was dotted with </p><p>crawling brown figures. Jenks looked and </p><p>knew that out on this slope of rocks was </p><p>death in a hundred forms. He looked at </p><p>the men around him, and their faces told </p><p>him that they knew it, too—but did not </p><p>care. Nor did he care, not for himself, but </p><p>because these men about him did not—and </p><p>they were his people! </p><p>THEY swept out on the open, un- </p><p>covered surface of the rocky slope, </p><p>and the whirring, scythe-like vol- </p><p>leys caught them. Jenks die rot even </p><p>bow his head before the metal blast,. In- </p><p>stead, he straightened himself jtnd looked </p><p>up with all his eyes. Everywhere he </p><p>jaw the crawling, scrabbling brown fig- </p><p>ures, the black rocks, the bursting shells </p><p>and the clouds of vapor lining the trenches </p><p>above him. Far ahead and above him </p><p>he saw a little tricolored moving dot </p><p>that slipped from rock to rock, disap- </p><p>peared, stopped, came out again, was lost </p><p>for a second in a wild scramble of brown </p><p>shapes—but always went on, a little for- </p><p>ward, a little farther up. Jenks raised his </p><p>rifle high above his head. Something wrig- </p><p>gled thrillingly inside him, and his full- </p><p>throated yell sounded high above the roar </p><p>of battle.. Men looked at him with an- </p><p>swering shouts as he bent his head and </p><p>started up the rocks. The tired lines moved </p><p>.'aster, Jenks in front; his eyes never leav- </p><p>ing that bobbing, tricolored spot above him. </p><p> Straight in front, perched on the top of a</p><p>natural salient of rock, was a battery of </p><p>Maxims. As yet the enemy had kept the </p><p>wicked little weapons silent. Their tiny </p><p>muzzles were trained on the wriggling </p><p>masses below them, the gunners stood with </p><p>their hands on the cranks, the open boxes </p><p>of ammunition waiting beside them, their </p><p>eyes shifting nervously from the slopes </p><p>below them to the swarthy officer at their</p><p>side. At length, when the brown waves </p><p>swept closer through the shrapnel and </p><p>bullets, he nodded, and the gunners turned </p><p>the cranks as easily as a grocer spins the </p><p>handle of his coffee-mill. </p><p> Into the very center of the group around</p><p>the tricolored dot sprayed the first shower </p><p>of bullets from the Maxims. On all sides </p><p>men raised their heads and looked an in- </p><p>stant as this new rasping, grinding note </p><p>sounded through the din. Jenks looked up </p><p>and saw the bright dot motionless, inert in </p><p>the center of a still brown pile. He heard </p><p>the clatter of the Maxims, and again his </p><p>yell sounded as he bounded up from rock </p><p>to rock. Once he felt a stab of pain in his </p><p>arm, again in his leg. He realized that he </p><p>could no longer raise his rifle, and flung it </p><p>away. </p><p> He was conscious only of three things:</p><p>that the noise of the Maxims grew steadily </p><p>louder; that the bright dot was closer, </p><p>and that he was growing weaker because </p><p>of something wet which kept sliding </p><p>away from him down his arm and leg. </p><p>Through a raging riot of noise and motion </p><p>he was" conscious of reaching down into a </p><p>tangle ot figures for the bright thing which </p><p>danced crazily before his eyes; of jerking </p><p>the yellow pole from a thin white hand </p><p>with a brown stain across it which clung </p><p>to the wooden pole with cold tenacity. It </p><p>was hard for him to regain his feet, because </p><p>another of the streams was slipping down </p><p>his shoulder now, but he lurched from his </p><p>knees to his feet with the bright thing </p><p>(cloth of some sort, he discovered) clinging to </p><p>his arms and legs and impeding his efforts </p><p>to go forward. </p><p> He sensed rather than knew that the</p><p>machine-like explosions had ceased and </p><p>that a mid chorus of shouting was sound- </p><p>ing high above the firing. He reached out </p><p>his hand and clutched the searing-hot barrel </p><p>of a Maxim. His hand slipped down to the </p><p>cooler metal of the supporting tripod, and, </p><p>with the other hand gripped around the </p><p>flagpole, he tried feebly to ward off the </p><p>blows of a swarthy officer who was slashing </p><p>at him with a sword of unnatural bright- </p><p>ness- </p><p>JENKS reached out the three fin- </p><p>gers of his left hand to accept the </p><p>cigarette which the drab-colored </p><p>man proffered him across the foot of the </p><p>tiny cot. </p><p> “Still smoke them pesky things?” he</p><p>demanded cheerfully.</p><p> The journalist replied that he did, and</p><p>asked Jenks how he was, as he held a match </p><p>so that the wounded man could light his </p><p>cigarette. </p><p> “Well,” answered Jenks as he leaned</p><p>back comfortably against the pillows, </p><p>“what’s left of me feels pretty good. They </p><p>take awful good care of me here. ’Bout a </p><p>dozen nurses cornin’ in every four or five </p><p>minutes to see if I don’t want somethin’, </p><p>an’ more doctors’n I can count. An’ eat! </p><p>Say, mister, I’ve eat so much since I come </p><p>here that I’m goin’ to be able to fast a year </p><p>when I get out! </p><p> “Yes, I’m goin’ to get out. They teii</p><p>me they was one time they didn’t think I </p><p>would. They had to pare off so much of </p><p>me to make the rest good for anything. </p><p>Gangrene, I think they said. I’ve got one </p><p>arm an’ ’bout a leg an’ three-quarters! I’ll </p><p>make a beaut of a farmer, won’t I? ” </p><p> The correspondent leaned on the foot of</p><p>the bed and asked his question with cold </p><p>deliberation, for he was very anxious to </p><p>know some things. </p><p>214 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Don’t you wish,” he asked, “that you’d</p><p>gone home that day you and I shot their </p><p>outpost through the middle? ” </p><p> “You just bet I don’t!” snapped Jenks.</p><p>“Why, man, all I wanted to do was get </p><p>home an’ 'tend to my farm! I never seemed </p><p>to think the country needed me! Some re- </p><p>porter chap was in here the other day— </p><p>few days after they give me this”—and </p><p>his hand strayed to the medal on his breast, </p><p>—“an’ he ’lowed that maybe we wouldn’t </p><p>have got up that hill if I hadn’t picked up </p><p>that there flag! Now I don’t believe that; </p><p>there was a sight of the boys right behint </p><p>me, an’ one of ’em ’Id ’a’ done it if I hadn’t </p><p>—but that ain’t the point! A feller’s pretty </p><p>small potatoes after all, and the country’s </p><p>a middlin’ big thing. It’s a darned sight </p><p>closer to ye than I used to think, too! It’s </p><p>kind of like a teller’s dad, a nice old party </p><p>like the feller in striped pants an’ a long </p><p>whisker in the papers. He’s yer boss, an’ </p><p>that’s all there is to it! But when ye get </p><p>to thinkin’ about it, you just plain want to </p><p>do what’s up to you to do! Maybe ye have </p><p>to give somethin’ up. I had to leggo of an </p><p>arm an’ a leg!

I </p><p>ain’t kickin’ none!”</p><p> And Jenks looked through the smoke of</p><p>his cigarette at the mass of red roses beside </p><p>his bed. </p><p> The war correspondent shook Jenks’</p><p>hand and (after a nod from the doctor) </p><p>dropped several packages of cigarettes on </p><p>the foot of the bed. Then he walked out of </p><p>the room feeling unaccountably good, and </p><p>warm and thankful at the very core of his </p><p>being-*~not so much toward Jenks as toward </p><p>a grotesque picture of a man in a swallow- </p><p>tafled blue coat, a pair of red-and-white </p><p>striped trousers and a long goatee. </p><p>ODONNELL,SURFMAN NUMBER SIX </p><p> BY FREDERICK ARTHUR DOMINY</p><p>I W' lT WAS a gloomy group that </p><p>I lounged about in more or less </p><p>I comfortable attitudes on the boat- </p><p>I—room runway and moodily pulled </p><p>at pipes that hung dejectedly from the </p><p>corners of their mouths. In the Keeper’s </p><p>office a rumble of voices could be heard and, </p><p>from the expectant glances the men on the </p><p>platform occasionally cast at the closed </p><p>door, it was evident that they were waiting </p><p>a verdict of some description—and were </p><p>already convinced that it would be unfavor- </p><p>able—from the occupants of the office. </p><p> As the suspense became more and more</p><p>unbearable, Billy Bennett removed his </p><p>pipe, expectorated with remarkable accu- </p><p>racy at a fly in front of him, and then, as </p><p>though displeased with his skill, shook his </p><p>head dejectedly. </p><p> “Ain’t no use shakin’ your head that-a-</p><p>way,” growled Saunders, Surfman No. 2. </p><p>“It’s done, an’ it can’t be undone. I don’t </p><p>mean drowndin’ that fly,” he continued, al- </p><p>though nobody had questioned his mean- </p><p>ing. “You all know what I mean. Ed </p><p>Baker’s leg is broke, an’ the Sup’enten’ent </p><p>won’t” let us take on the only man we’d </p><p>have a chance with, as a sub, but sends us </p><p>that el’g’ble list to pick from, an’ we’ve got </p><p>’bout as much chance of winnin’ that cup </p><p>as a snowball has in some places I could </p><p>mention.” </p><p> His air was the air of a man eager to pro-</p><p>voke a controversy, but affirmative grunts </p><p>were his only reply, and it was evident that </p><p>no one had the spirit to argue the question, </p><p>so he hitched into a more or less comfortable </p><p>attitude against the dooi-casing and gazed </p><p>surlily at the surrounding sand-dunes. </p><p> Something had occurred to upset the</p><p>usual smooth and cheerful tenor of life at </p><p>Zachs Inlet Life-Saving Station, that was </p><p>evident, and in consequence, the crew of that</p><p>station were a most disheartened set of men. </p><p>O'Donnell, Surfman Number Six </p><p>215 </p><p> It had happened as they were drilling with</p><p>the surf-boat. A wave, and just an ordinary </p><p>sized wave at that, had rolled up on the </p><p>beach at a most inopportune moment and, </p><p>Likte many other waves, had carried before </p><p>it everything in its path, incidentally throw- </p><p>ing the heavy boat on to Edward Baker, </p><p>Surfman No. 6, and breaking his leg. This </p><p>leg at that time was doubly precious, for </p><p>it furnished a good part of the power which </p><p>enabled Baker to kick his way through the </p><p>water to many victories in various swim- </p><p>ming contests. </p><p> Besides his ability as a swimmer, Baker</p><p>was able to cover a foot or so more at the </p><p>standing broad jump than the average man, </p><p>and consequently was a man valuable for </p><p>other purposes than those for which he was </p><p>drawing pay from Uncle Sam. </p><p> But while it may seem to you a matter</p><p>of little moment—this accidental breaking </p><p>of a surfman’s leg, which would mend in </p><p>ihe course of a month or so at the least—it </p><p>was a matter of great importance to the </p><p>members of the Zachs Inlet crew. If they </p><p>had not already made their boasts regard- </p><p>ing the capture of a certain cup, presented </p><p>by a retired lieutenant of the Revenue </p><p>Cutter Service who had once been the </p><p>Assistant Inspector for their district and </p><p>was still interested in the service, which </p><p>ivas to be contested for on the first day of </p><p>the inactive season by the three crews on </p><p>Oak Island, they would not have taken it </p><p>to heart so badly, and now—well, they </p><p>might .finish a poor third. They could do </p><p>no worse. </p><p> At first, when they had hauled Baker</p><p>ashore and discovered the broken leg, their </p><p>chance had not seemed so seriously im- </p><p>paired. To be sure, they were sorry that </p><p>he had been so unfortunate, but broken </p><p>legs are not dangerous, and they knew of a </p><p>man who could replace the injured man. </p><p>That was one of their first thoughts. Get </p><p>Charley Suydam to substitute, for substi- </p><p>tutes were eligible to contest, and there </p><p>would be no weakness in their team. But </p><p>then along came the Superintendent’s let- </p><p>ter, coldly stating that as Baker would be </p><p>off for an indefinite period, he was inclosing </p><p>the list of eligible surfmen for Keeper Rorke </p><p>£0 select from, and would thank the Keeper </p><p>to make his selection immediately. </p><p> And that eligible list! Of the five men 011</p><p>it none was "known to the crew of Zachs </p><p>Inlet Station, which made matters worse, </p><p>if they could be any worse. It was simply </p><p>a question of choosing blindly, and after </p><p>hearing the views of the crew, Keeper </p><p>Rorke and the No. x man, Jim Reynolds, </p><p>had gone into executive session in the </p><p>Keeper’s office. </p><p> Finally the scraping 01 chairs being</p><p>pushed over the floor was heard and then </p><p>the office door opened and the Keeper </p><p>stepped into the boat-room, followed by </p><p>Reynolds. </p><p> Forestalling the questions that were sure</p><p>to come, he said: “Well, boys, Jim and I </p><p>have done the best we could.. There were </p><p>two Swedes, one Dutchman, and two Amer- </p><p>icans on the list and we’ve picked one of </p><p>the Americans. Name, William O’Don- </p><p>nell. He must have Irish blood in him. </p><p>That’s about the only reason we took him. </p><p>I never saw an Irishman, or a half-irishman </p><p>for that matter, who wasn’t good at some- </p><p>thing." Perhaps the Keeper was influenced </p><p>by his own ancestry, for he boasted that </p><p>many of his ancestors had kissed the Blar- </p><p>ney Stone. </p><p> So it was settled, and forthwith the list</p><p>was returned to the Superintendent with </p><p>the information that William O’Donnell </p><p>had been selected by Keeper Rorke to fill </p><p>the vacancy at the Zachs Inlet Life-Saving </p><p>Station. </p><p>WHEN the day came upon which </p><p>O’Donnell had been notified to </p><p>report for duty, never had a new </p><p>surfman’s arrival excited so much interest. </p><p>Even Charley Hulse, the most irresponsible </p><p>and happy-go-lucky member of the Zachs </p><p>Inlet crew, gave up the pleasures of twenty- </p><p>four hours’ leave bn the mainland in order </p><p>to be present when he appeared. </p><p> Numerous were the conjectures as to his</p><p>size, weight, and ability. Somehow the im- </p><p>pression had arisen that this latest addition </p><p>to their ranks would be a great, husky six- </p><p>footer, although their reasons for assuming </p><p>so could not have been given; and hopes </p><p>had even been expressed that he would be </p><p>able to handle the hammer and shot, two </p><p>of the events in which the Zachs Inlet crew </p><p>were not particularly good, but for which </p><p>they were compelled to make entries in the </p><p>coming contest. </p><p> Great was the disappointment, then, to</p><p>those who had been watching a small-sized </p><p>sailboat as it gradually neared the beach </p><p>and was finally anchored in front of the</p><p>Adventure </p><p>Station, to see a moderate-sized man throw </p><p>.! dunnage-bag into the dingey towing be- </p><p>dnd and paddle ashore. The members of </p><p>he crew who were crowded together in the </p><p>ookout-tower were loud in their expression </p><p>&gt;f disgust at his appearance. </p><p> “Little runt!” growled Billy Bennett.</p><p>' I don’t see how he passed the ’zamination. </p><p>.lin’t over five-foot-five if he’s an inch, an’ </p><p>i’ll bet he don’t weigh one-twenty!” </p><p> “An’ get on to that walk of his!” added</p><p>Drake, No. 4. “Looks like he had a wooden </p><p>ieg, he swings it that stiff.” </p><p> And pessimistic Saunders, delighted to</p><p>Lhink that his predictions seemed more </p><p>ihan ever sure to be realized, exclaimed: </p><p>‘Didn’t I tell you so? I said when Baker </p><p>^ot hurt an’ we found we couldn’t get </p><p>&gt;uydam to sub, that we might jest as well </p><p>&lt;ive up any idea of winnin’ that cup. He’s </p><p>&gt;1 hefty lookin’ critter to help us out, now, </p><p>ain't he?” </p><p> Unaware of the dismay his personality</p><p>!iad caused, the newcomer continued up the </p><p>oath and soon the watchers above heard </p><p>;um stamping the sand from his shoes at </p><p>.he mess-room door. Then the murmur of </p><p>voices floated up to the tower. </p><p> “Might jest as well go down an’ get in-</p><p>..roduced an’ get the agony over with,” said </p><p>Bennett. “I don’t s’pose he can help it </p><p>cause he’s little, an’ as he’s here we’ve got </p><p>o	make the best of it.”</p><p> So four pairs of shoes clumped down the</p><p>tairs, and as each man entered the mess- </p><p>-00m he acknowledged Keeper Rorke’s </p><p>introduction to the man standing beside </p><p>lim with a handshake and a perfunctory </p><p>‘Mow’d you do?” </p><p> A WEEK passed and then another</p><p>and the momentous day was swiftly </p><p>' drawing near, but still the Zachs </p><p>inlet crew were unable to view their chances </p><p>n anything but the most unfavorable light. </p><p>There was only one event of which they </p><p>.vere sure of, and that was the dash. Billy </p><p>Bennett was able to negotiate a hundred </p><p>yards in close to ten seconds at any time, </p><p>.md might do a trifle better if pushed. That </p><p>:hey knew, and there was no man in the </p><p>hree stations that was as good by a second, </p><p>&gt;ut in all the other trials it seemed as if </p><p>hey would have to be contented with a </p><p>.econd or third. </p><p> Before Baker’s accident they had also</p><p>been practically sure of winning the swim </p><p>and the standing broad jump, but now</p><p>Parker of Gilgo was the most powerful </p><p>swimmer, and Lee, also of Gilgo, the best </p><p>jumper in the three stations. The Station </p><p>slate had been covered a dozen times with </p><p>figures indicating the points each station </p><p>was reasonably sure of, and each time the </p><p>ultimate result was the same. The other </p><p>stations, Napeague and Gilgo, were credited </p><p>with twenty-four and twenty-one points </p><p>respectively, and Zachs Inlet with the re- </p><p>mainder, eighteen. </p><p> There were seven events, a one-hundred-</p><p>yard dash, mile run, standing broad jump, </p><p>swimming race, hammer-throw, shot-put, </p><p>and last, three men from each station were </p><p>to compete in aclay-pigeon shoot; and the </p><p>points were counted at five for first, three </p><p>for second, and one for third. </p><p> Calculate as closely as they could, there</p><p>seemed to be no other result obtainable, </p><p>and consequently it seemed inevitable that </p><p>Zachs Inlet would finish third. </p><p> After O’Donnell had been in the Station</p><p>for nearly a ftionth and had satisfactorily </p><p>explained the lameness that had so dis- </p><p>gusted Saunders by remarking one day that </p><p>he was recovering from an injury to his </p><p>knee-cap, Jim Reynolds met him returning </p><p>from fog patrol and took it upon himself to </p><p>question him regarding his abilities, ex- </p><p>plaining the predicament they were in and </p><p>expressing the hope that he would be able </p><p>to help toward securing that coveted cup. </p><p>He had received but little encouragement. </p><p> “Sure,” O’Donnell had replied, “I’ll do</p><p>what I can for the boys, but that ain’t </p><p>much, I’m thinkin’. I used to be a bit of a </p><p>swimmer when I was a kid, so mebbe you’d </p><p>better put me down in that, an’ I’ll practise </p><p>up these fine mornin’s.” </p><p> “But ain’t there anything you’re good</p><p>at?” earnestly inquired Reynolds. “Ain’t </p><p>there something you can do a little better’n </p><p>common,?” </p><p> O’Donnell scratched his head thought-</p><p>fully for a moment before he answered and </p><p>then exclaimed enthusiastically, “Sure an’ </p><p>there is! I’ll bet there ain’t a man on the </p><p>beach can beat me jiggin’! But it ain’t </p><p>jiggin’ you want?’’ he asked anxiously, al- </p><p>though the twinkle in his eye belied his </p><p>words. </p><p> “ Oh,-! ” Reynolds was too disgusted</p><p>for further reply, and turned toward the </p><p>Station. Then thinking, perhaps, that even </p><p>a moderately good swimmer might be of </p><p>O'Donnell, Surfman Number Six </p><p>217</p><p>some assistance," he stepped and issued the </p><p>following order. “Tell you wnat you do, </p><p>O’Donnell, You practise swimmin’ every </p><p>time you get a chance, an’ mebbe you’ll get </p><p>us a point or two, finishin’ second or third.” </p><p>At a conference the following morning </p><p>Reynolds detailed the results of his ques- </p><p>tioning to the little group surrounding him, </p><p>and what little hopes they might have had </p><p>were immediately dissipated. “An’ all he </p><p>said he was good at was jiggin’!” growled </p><p>Saunders. “Jiggin’!” Nothing more ex- </p><p>pressive than the snort of disgust accom- </p><p>panying this could have been uttered, and </p><p>Saunders’ opinion of O’Donnell’s ability </p><p>was echoed by the others. </p><p> “So that’s all he can do, eh? Swim a</p><p>little an’ jig. Well, it’s sure we can’t figure </p><p>on him, then, an’ 1 reckon that settles it.” </p><p>With this, Bennett arose and walked toward </p><p>the beach where a hundred yards had been </p><p>measured off on the hard, smooth sand, </p><p>close to the water’s edge. </p><p> The rest of the group followed him and</p><p>watched him at his training. Three times </p><p>his flying feet covered the distance in record </p><p>time, and this sight so cheered the others </p><p>that for a moment their hopes arose. Then </p><p>that oft-calculated score, Napeague twenty- </p><p>four, Gilgo twenty-one, and Zachs Inlet </p><p>eighteen, was remembered, and Saunders </p><p>•remarked, for about the fortieth time, </p><p>“T’aint no use. Billy can’t win but one </p><p>thing au’ that’s already been figgered on.” </p><p>Ill </p><p>FINALLY the day came and, as </p><p>some one declared, “it couldn’t have </p><p>been no better if it had been made </p><p>to order.” Bright and clear, with a cool </p><p>breeze blowing from the-ocean along the </p><p>beach, it was just the weather to incite a </p><p>man to put forth the best there was in him, </p><p>and even the Zachs Inlet crew joked and </p><p>laughed as they tumbled into the Keeper’s </p><p>dory for the four-mile run to Gilgo, the </p><p>center station of the three, upon the grounds </p><p>of which the championship of the island </p><p>was to be settled. </p><p> Everything1 was- in readiness when they</p><p>arrived, the Napeague crew having pre- </p><p>ceded them, so the rules governing the </p><p>different events were read by one of the </p><p>judges and agreed upon as satisfactory, and </p><p>then the entrants for the one-hundred-yard </p><p>dash were notified to take their positions </p><p>on the starting-line, and the pistol gave </p><p>them the signal. </p><p> It was Bennett’s race from the first. No</p><p>wther sprinter was within fifteen feet of him </p><p>as he passed the fifty-yard mark, and the </p><p>race was made interesting only by the hard </p><p>struggle for second and third positions. </p><p>Now King of Napeague was a foot or two </p><p>in front, but the pace was too fast and he </p><p>dropped behind Havens of Gilgo, and it </p><p>seemed as if they would finish in that order. </p><p>But a surprise w'as sprung upon the specta- </p><p>tors in the last fifteen yards. Hulse had </p><p>been running close behind the two leaders </p><p>of the second division, and now it became </p><p>evident that he would be a factor in the </p><p>race. Inspired, perhaps, by the flying </p><p>figure of Ms team-mate, now close to the </p><p>finishing-line, he made a last desperate at- </p><p>tempt for second honors and slowly but </p><p>surely passed King and challenged Havens </p><p>in a final burst of speed that put him over </p><p>the line a scant six inches ahead of the </p><p>Gilgo man. </p><p> Great was the delight of the Zachs Inlet</p><p>crew at this unlooked-for win, and when the </p><p>scorekeeper chalked up a large eight on the </p><p>board opposite their Station’s name they </p><p>almost began to believe that they had a </p><p>chance. </p><p> But it seemed as though that were the</p><p>only event they were to figure in. Howell </p><p>of Napeague beat Reynolds’ best throw </p><p>with the hammer by a good ten feet, and </p><p>another Napeague man was third. Then </p><p>Reynolds could do no better than finish </p><p>third in the shot-put, first and second also </p><p>being won by Napeague. The standing </p><p>broad jump was easily won by Lee, Gilgo’s </p><p>representative, and it seemed as if that </p><p>station had a monopoly on jumpers, for they </p><p>also captured second and third. </p><p> Then came the mile run, and this proved</p><p>another disappointment. Saunders and </p><p>Drake represented Zachs Inlet in this, and </p><p>both were confident of finishing well up. </p><p>In fact, they thought that Haff, Gilgo’s </p><p>entrant, was the only one they could not </p><p>easily beat, and even if he succeeded in win- </p><p>ning, second and third positions would give </p><p>them four points, which would just put </p><p>Zachs Inlet in the lead. But they had over- </p><p>rated their abilities. Instead of finishing </p><p>second and third, they were a good one hun- </p><p>dred feet behind Haff when he crossed the </p><p>line, with Pike and Howell of Napeague </p><p>close at his heels. </p><p>218 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Now the points totaled as follows!</p><p>Napeague leading with eighteen, Gilgo fif-</p><p>teen, and Zachs Inlet twelve. </p><p> It surely looked as if Zachs Inlet’s last</p><p>chance were gone, and the men were cor- </p><p>respondingly discouraged. Saunders, who </p><p>had not finished puffing from his recent </p><p>exertions in the run, stood in front of the </p><p>score-board and watched the totals as they </p><p>were written by the scorer. “Didn’t I tell </p><p>you so?” he declared. “An’ there ain’t no </p><p>one to blame but the sup’entendant. Suy- </p><p>dam would a’ won that mile easy, an’ there </p><p>ain’t a man on the beach can beat him' </p><p>shootin’ clay birds. We might jest as well </p><p>pack up an’ go home. It’s only wastin’ </p><p>time foolin’ with that swimmin’ race. </p><p>O’Donnell ain’t got a chance.” </p><p> And it was evident that the others</p><p>thought the same regarding O’Donnell, </p><p>their only representative in the swimming </p><p>match. </p><p> But O’Donnell did not seem particularly</p><p>concerned at this lack of confidence on the </p><p>part of his team-mates. Instead, he turned </p><p>to the downcast crew with a smile of en- </p><p>couragement. “Sure, boys, don’t be givin’ </p><p>up yet! There’s a chance, an’ you ain’t </p><p>beat till the last score’s counted. Come on </p><p>an’ watch me win that swim,” he urged, </p><p>but they paid no attention to his chatter, </p><p>so he left them and walked across the beach </p><p>to the bay in which the swimming race </p><p>was to be held. </p><p> Reynolds looked after his retreating back</p><p>for a moment and then said: “Come on, </p><p>boys, let’s be decent, anyhow. There ain’t </p><p>a doubt in the world but what he’ll get </p><p>beat, but he belongs to our Station and it </p><p>ain’t hardly right to stay here an’ not even </p><p>watch him.” </p><p> So they straggled over the beach hills</p><p>and seated themselves on the bluff over- </p><p>hanging the bay shore. Off about three </p><p>hundred yards a fair sized float had been </p><p>anchored, and on this were the starter and </p><p>the six competitors. The finish was marked </p><p>by a small boat anchored close to the shore </p><p>and occupied by the judges. </p><p>AT A WORD from the official on </p><p>the float the swimmers took posi- </p><p>tions close to its edge and awaited </p><p>the signal. It was given, and six bodies </p><p>cleft the water in long, clean dives. For </p><p>a moment all was a confusion of splash- </p><p>ing water, but, as the men came to the sur- </p><p>face and struck out sturdily for the judges’ </p><p>boat with long, powerful strokes, .they </p><p>gradually separated and it resolved into a </p><p>hard-fought struggle with little choice as to</p><p>the winner. </p><p> Half-way in and there was but little</p><p>difference in their positions; then, as the </p><p>distance began to tell, changes became ap- </p><p>parent in their ranks. Now the stronger </p><p>swimmers forged ahead, until it finally </p><p>narrowed down to a fight between two, </p><p>with the others stringing out behind. </p><p> But the men lying about on the bluff</p><p>were hardly interested. </p><p> “If Baker was here that race would be</p><p>worth seein’,” grieved Drake. </p><p> “Well, he ain’t, so what’s the use of</p><p>kickin’ ’bout it?” snapped Hulse. “I don’t </p><p>care who wins the dam Gup, anyhow! </p><p>S’pose O’Donnell’s somewhere back with </p><p>the tail-enders, ain’t he, Jim?” he asked, </p><p>observing that Reynolds had suddenly </p><p>jumped to his feet and was '"studying the </p><p>race intently. </p><p> “Stand up an’ holler, you chumps!”</p><p>Reynolds excitedly replied. “If that little </p><p>cuss ain’t givin’ Parker the race of his life, </p><p>I’ll eat my hat! Holler, I tell you! Holler! ” </p><p> And they did. Over the water they sent</p><p>a yell of delight, of hope,.of encouragement. </p><p>“O’Donnell, O’Donnell!” They shouted. </p><p>“Come on, you Billy O’Donnellf” </p><p> Their discouragement was forgotten.</p><p>Already it had occurred to them that, with </p><p>the swimming race won, they had a fighting </p><p>chance for the cup. Scrambling down the </p><p>steep, bushy side of the bluff, careless of </p><p>tumbles and scratches, they rushed to the </p><p>water’s edge, eagerly shouting their team- </p><p>mate’s name and excitedly urging him on- </p><p>ward. </p><p> And it seemed as if their shouts had the</p><p>desired effect, for no sooner had the first </p><p>ones been uttered than O’Donnell shot ahead </p><p>with a speed that was marvelous. Swim- </p><p>ming low in the water with a curious, grasp- </p><p>ing stroke that was new to the surfmen, he </p><p>left Parker behind so rapidly that it made </p><p>him gasp with surprise. Straight toward </p><p>the judges’ boat he swam, gaining on his </p><p>competitors so easily that it was rlmost </p><p>laughable. </p><p> “Swim? He can outswim a fish!”</p><p>Hulse gleefully shouted. “An’ we s?dd he </p><p>never had a chance, we did! Ain’t we a </p><p>smart bunch! Fools! Jest plain ordinary </p><p>fools, that’s what we are!” </p><p>O’Donnell, Surfman Number Six </p><p>219 </p><p> Charley could contain himself no longer.</p><p>As he saw a wet hand grasp the gunwale of </p><p>the judges’ boat and then O’Donnell’s face</p><p>peer over the side, he yelled again with </p><p>delight, and, dashing into the shoal water, </p><p>ha If carried, half dragged, the victorious </p><p>swimmer ashore into the midst of the </p><p>wildly hilarious Zachs Inlet crew. </p><p> O’Donnell was the only self-possessed</p><p>man.4n the crowd. Serenely grinning at </p><p>the behavior of the others, he let them pull </p><p>off the bathing-suit he had worn and fairly </p><p>quarrel over the honor of rubbing him </p><p>down, and listened indifferently to their </p><p>praises of his newly discovered ability. </p><p>Only once did he speak and then it was to </p><p>remark smilingly: “Sure, boys, I told you I </p><p>could swim a bit, but it’s jiggin’ that’s my </p><p>long suit!” </p><p> When calm had in a measure been re-</p><p>stored during the walk across the beach, </p><p>-.hey clustered around the score-board to </p><p>view the revised score. Now the points </p><p>were so evenly divided among the stations </p><p>chat the shooting-match would decide the </p><p>matter, and they were fairly confident of </p><p>their chance in that. Parker of Gilgo had </p><p>finished second, and Pike of Napeague </p><p>third, in the swim, so that the board now </p><p>showed the points as follows: Napeague </p><p>nineteen, Gilgo eighteen, and Zachs Inlet </p><p>seventeen. </p><p>, Little time was left them to discuss this </p><p>situation, however, for the judges were </p><p>calling for the trap-shooters, and they </p><p>hurried to secure favorable positions from </p><p>which to watch this event. </p><p> Each station was represented by a team</p><p>of three men who were to shoot at twenty </p><p>birds each, in series of five, and the highest </p><p>individual scores were to decide the con- </p><p>test. Keeper Rorke, Hulse, and Bennett </p><p>were the Zachs Inlet entrants, and the </p><p>Keeper was the first man called. His start </p><p>promised well for Zachs Inlet, for he broke </p><p>his five birds in as many shots, but this ad- </p><p>vantage was not held long, for Howell of </p><p>Napeague duplicated his feat, although the </p><p>Gilgo man, Lee, had to be content with </p><p>four kills. </p><p>. Then the next three men shot, but Hulse </p><p>broke but three, while both Napeague’s </p><p>and - Gilgo’s representatives scored four </p><p>each. </p><p> Now it was up to Bennett to retrieve the</p><p>lost points, and his mates were confident </p><p>that he would do it. But where was Billy? </p><p>The scorer was calling his name and the </p><p>other shooters were showing annoyance at </p><p>his tardiness. </p><p> Reynolds had been scanning the faces of</p><p>the crowd in an unsuccessful attempt to </p><p>find him. “ Come to think of it,” he whis- </p><p>pered to the nearest man, “Billy didn’t </p><p>come back ’cross the beach with us, did he? ” </p><p>“Don’t believe he did, though I hadn’t </p><p>missed him,” was the reply, and then it was </p><p>discovered, upon questioning the remainder </p><p>of the crew, that none of them had seen Ben- </p><p>nett since leaving the bay. </p><p> “Drake, you go tell the Keeper that</p><p>Billy’ll be there in a minute, an’ to get </p><p>them to go on with the shootin’, an’ the </p><p>rest of us’ll hunt him up,” instructed Rey- </p><p>nolds. So the judges were informed that </p><p>Bennett would be ready to shoot in a short </p><p>time, and Pike of Napeague faced the trap, </p><p>REYNOLDS, Saunders and O’Don- </p><p>nell hurried across the tbeach and </p><p>upon arriving at the bay-side dis- </p><p>covered that another calamity had over- </p><p>taken Zachs Inlet. Very white and still, </p><p>Bennett lay at the foot of the bluff down </p><p>which they had so wildly rushed to w'elcome </p><p>O’Donnell. He looked up at the others with </p><p>a wan smile. “Thought you’d miss me </p><p>’fore long,” he said. </p><p> “But what’s the matter, Billy?" Rey-</p><p>nolds inquired. </p><p> “Guess I must have turned my ankle</p><p>when I fell dowm the hill,” he replied. “1 </p><p>yelled at you fellers when I did it, but you </p><p>was so worked up over that swimmin’ race </p><p>you never heard it. Then I tried to hop </p><p>along after you left, but my leg hurt so I </p><p>guess I must have fainted.” </p><p> “Well, this settles it!” ejaculated Saun-</p><p>ders. '‘If w'e ain’t been runnin’ in the </p><p>damdest luck! First Baker broke his leg </p><p>an’ now Billy here’s bunged up so he can't </p><p>shoot. ' Jest when we thought wre had a </p><p>chance, too!” he added mournfully. “But </p><p>it ain’t no use!” </p><p> And it did look as if the Zachs Inlet crew</p><p>were hoodooed, but, as Reynolds remarked: </p><p>“It ain’t of no use crying over spilt milk. </p><p>That shootin’-match is all over, far as we </p><p>are concerned, for there ain’t another man </p><p>in the crew that can break one of them clay </p><p>birds out of five. We’ll carry Billy over </p><p>to the station an’ then report to Keeper </p><p>Rorke." </p><p> So they carried their crippled mate across</p><p>220 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the beach and made him comfortable in </p><p>the boat-room of the Gilgo station. Then, </p><p>just as Reynolds was about to leave, </p><p>O’Donnell stopped him.</p><p>“If Billy’ll lend me his gun,” he said, </p><p>“ I’ll try to hold my end of that Shootin’ up.” </p><p>“But you never said you could shoot,” </p><p>protested Reynolds. “If you think you’ve </p><p>got a chance, though-” </p><p> “He never said he could swim, either!”</p><p>broke in Saunders. “That is, he never said </p><p>he could swim good. By Moses, Jim, let </p><p>him try it! I begin to believe he’s one of </p><p>them kind that don’t brag ’bout what they </p><p>can do. If he’s willin’ to shoot, I say let </p><p>him shoot!” </p><p> Saunders, upon receiving a nod from</p><p>Bennett, hustled about, took the gun out </p><p>of its case, put it together, and handed it </p><p>to O’Donnell. </p><p> “Now, son,” he instructed him, “you</p><p>hurry out there an’ do your darndest. </p><p>If you get beat there won’t be any hard </p><p>feelings ’bout it, anyhow.” </p><p> When the judges were informed of Ben-</p><p>nett’s accident they consented to O’Don- </p><p>nell’s taking his place, and immediately sent </p><p>him to the trap. </p><p> He missed the first bird and a despairing</p><p>groan arose from the Zachs Inlet crew. </p><p>Then he broke the next four, and that groan </p><p>was changed into a joyful cheer. </p><p> The shooting continued, and as Keeper</p><p>Rorke broke bird after bird, and O’Donnell </p><p>did not seem to know what it was to miss </p><p>after that first lost bird, it became evident </p><p>that again this “little runt,” as Bennett </p><p>had called him, was the mainstay of their </p><p>team. </p><p> Then the Keeper missed one, but recov-</p><p>ered and broke his last five cleanly, retiring </p><p>with a score of nineteen broken, which was </p><p>evidently most satisfactory to him, if you </p><p>could judge from the smile upon his face. </p><p>Now O’Donnell’s name was called. He was </p><p>the last man to shoot and upon the result </p><p>of those five shots hung the championship. </p><p> Keeper Rorke was high man with nine-</p><p>teen, and Howell and Pike of Napeague </p><p>were tied with eighteen each. If O’Donnell </p><p>did not beat the Napeague shooters, the </p><p>Keeper’s score would do no good, as the five </p><p>points would make Zachs Inlet but twenty- </p><p>two, while Napeague, with a second and </p><p>third, counting four, would total twenty- </p><p>three points. </p><p> He was by far the calmest man in the</p><p>crowd when he faced the trap. With four- </p><p>teen breaks to his credit it meant that he </p><p>would have to make a clean score on these </p><p>next five birds to win the championship for </p><p>his station. One miss, and he would tie the</p><p>Napeaguers. Two missed, and the cup was </p><p>surely lost. </p><p> “Are you ready?” he coolly asked the</p><p>trapper. “Ready!” was the reply. “PjjII!” </p><p>Crack! That target was broken into" a </p><p>thousand particles. Again the question </p><p>and reply, followed by the sharp command, </p><p>“Pull!” and another target smashed. </p><p> Saunders was hysterically patting Rey-</p><p>nolds on the back and muttering what -was </p><p>meant as words of encouragement to- the </p><p>shooter. </p><p> Two more of the clay sauceirs were broken</p><p>by that impassive man facing the trap, and </p><p>now he was calmly loading his-gun for the </p><p>final shot.	; •</p><p> “S’pose he misses -it!” whispered Rey-</p><p>nolds. </p><p> “He ain’t a-goin’ to!” Saunders replied</p><p>earnestly. “Didn’t I tell you so?” he </p><p>shouted as the gun cracked and the last </p><p>target was broken. But Reynolds did hot </p><p>hear him, for his shout was drowned in the </p><p>cheer that arose from-the others of the </p><p>Zachs Inlet crew and their adherents among </p><p>the spectators. </p><p> There was an excited group surrounding</p><p>O’Donnell, who did not have to await the </p><p>judges’ decision. They knew they were the </p><p>champions of Oak Island, and they also </p><p>knew that but for this little man in their </p><p>midst they would have lost. They were all </p><p>talking at once, but O’Donnell listened </p><p>with a composed countenance to their ex- </p><p>travagant praises until Reynolds lifted his </p><p>voice above the rest. </p><p> “He don’t look like he amounted to</p><p>much,” he cried, “but, boys, I want to tell </p><p>you right here, we’ll know' better’n to pick </p><p>a man by his size next time!” </p><p> Then he was interrupted. “Say, Jim,”</p><p>inquired the object of this flattery, “sure </p><p>an’ there’s one thing I’d like to know, an’ </p><p>that’s this: Do you think there’s a man on </p><p>the island can beat me jiggin’?” </p><p> And Reynolds, remembering his reply</p><p>when that same subject had been intro- </p><p>duced before, repeated it. “Oh,-l”.he </p><p>said, but this time his voice did not express </p><p>disgust and annoyance. </p><p>i </p><p> FORMLESS, fringy, low-lying,</p><p>white-brown-and-yellow thing, for </p><p>all the world like a fried egg afloat, </p><p>drifted between the blunt-nosed </p><p>ferry-boat and’ her slip. It was the canal- </p><p>boat caravan, the loosely articulated, haw- </p><p>ser-bound “Albany tow” with its flat white</p><p>deckhouses and yellow-striped gunwales </p><p>and its fluttering lines of checked jumpers, </p><p>white petticoats and such, all fresh from the </p><p>wash-buckets. Fussy tugs pulled at great </p><p>cables ahead, fussy tugs scurried around </p><p>the flanks, trimming in the loose ends. </p><p> Sharp and fierce the signal bells rang in</p><p>the engine-room of the ferry-boat and the </p><p>ancient craft trembled under the strain as </p><p>her paddle-wheels beat in reversal. The </p><p>waters gurgled and churned and a stream </p><p>of foamy soap-suds surged out from under </p><p>tbe bows. </p><p> Two men stood on the forward deck,</p><p>leaning against the heavy railing. The </p><p>ruffled silk hat of one of them was pulled </p><p>down over his eyes. The eyes were slightly </p><p>bloodshot because the owner of them had </p><p>been drinking, but otherwise they were very </p><p>pleasant gray eyes, just as the face with its </p><p>smooth, broad brow and straight, beardless </p><p>features was a very pleasant face. The </p><p>garments of the young man—he was about </p><p>twenty-five—were- of fashionable material, </p><p>although somewhat tousled like his brown </p><p>hair, and they fitted well a clean-limbed, </p><p>six-foot frame. </p><p> The other was older, although not much;</p><p>a short, stocky fellow with an aggressively </p><p>protuberant chest, sharp features and nar- </p><p>row, shrewd, humorous eyes. His cutaway </p><p>coat, gray trousers and black derby hat </p><p>were speckless, his patent-leather shoes </p><p>refulgent, his gray silk waistcoat was but- </p><p>toned with diamond-centered pearl discs </p><p>and his lavender scarf was held by a big </p><p>diamond pin. </p><p> Although standing side by side they had</p><p>not spoken since the ferry-boat left the </p><p>Brooklyn shore. The older man glanced </p><p>occasionally at the younger, the younger </p><p>glared gloomily down at the waters; The </p><p>foamy streak from the paddle-boxes caught </p><p>his sight and excited his disapproval. </p><p> “Thought I wash on the fron’ o’ thish</p><p>boat?” he said, addressing the other. </p><p> “Right you were, bo!” was the cheery</p><p>answer. </p><p> “Um! Wah—when’d we turn aroun’? ”</p><p> “Didn’t. She’s backing up.”</p><p> “Goin’ back to Brooklyn?”</p><p> “Looks like it.”</p><p> “Well, she c’n go ish she likes; I’m</p><p>not!” said the younger man decisively and </p><p>he jumped overboard. </p><p>DAD and DESTINY </p><p>BY JOHN A HEFFERNAN </p><p>221</p><p>222	'	Adventure</p><p> “Oi-yoi!" exclaimed the other in amaze-</p><p>ment. “Man overboard!” he yelled, rais- </p><p>ing his voice so that it rang tliroughout the </p><p>vessel. Quickly he slipped oil his coat, </p><p>transferred a gold watch from the fob pocket </p><p>of his trousers to the inside pocket,of the </p><p>outer garment, folded the latter neatly, </p><p>laid it on the deck, and, jumping upon t£e </p><p>Hat top of the railing, dove into the white </p><p>surge. </p><p> Fifty feet away the other man came to</p><p>the surface, shook the brine from his eyes </p><p>with a vigorous twist of his head and flung </p><p>his right hand forward in a powerful, prac- </p><p>tised overhand stroke. He was heading </p><p>for the canal-boats, which were nearer to </p><p>him than the rapidly receding ferry-boat, </p><p>but he looked back in time to see the man </p><p>in the gray silk waistcoat plunge from the </p><p>rail after him. The chill of the river had </p><p>cleared his brain and he understood. With </p><p>some anxiety he watched the bobbing head </p><p>of the other swimmer. The latter made </p><p>progress slowly and, as he approached, it </p><p>was quite plain that he was laboring hard. </p><p>Gray-eyes turned and went after him and </p><p>drew up alongside with a few of his long </p><p>reaches. </p><p> “How are you?” he asked.</p><p> ‘“Bout all—all in!” gasped the other.</p><p>“ Got-got a-cramp in—in my—gurgle- </p><p>gurglel ” </p><p> The waves closed over his head. Gray-</p><p>eyes slipped down and caught him and </p><p>without difficulty got him back to the </p><p>surface. </p><p> “Lie perfectly quiet!” he admonished,</p><p>holding him by the collar and swimming </p><p>easily on his back. </p><p> “All right,” the stocky chap answered.</p><p> Meanwhile in wild excitement passengers</p><p>were crowding upon the deck of the ferry- </p><p>boat, that calliope cry, “Man overboard!” </p><p>having drawn them in haste from the cabins. </p><p>Blue-shirted deckhands were loosening coils </p><p>of rope and tying big cruller-shaped life- </p><p>preservers to the ends of them. The man </p><p>in the pilot-house signaled “Slow speed </p><p>ahead!” to the engine-room and tooted like </p><p>mad with his whistle. </p><p> Tidal action had swung the canal-boat</p><p>flotilla around so that the tail of it was </p><p>within one hundred feet of the two men in </p><p>the water and Gray-eyes struck out for the </p><p>nearer craft. It was easy work for him to </p><p>make the distance; he soon grasped the </p><p>line dropped over the side, and, still holding</p><p>his companion by the collar, looked up into </p><p>a pair of very large brown eyes that peered </p><p>over the rail of a big grain-barge. </p><p> “Thanks!” he said, grinning.</p><p> The possessor of the big brown eyes</p><p>nodded acknowledgment. </p><p> “Hold tight!” she directed. "I’ll slip a</p><p>ladder down to you.” </p><p> A minute later the end of a long ladder</p><p>fell beside him and he swung around, so that </p><p>his companion could catch a rung. </p><p> “ Can you climb up, or shall I carry you? ”</p><p>he asked. </p><p> “I can make it,” the short man replied</p><p>briefly. </p><p> “All right; you go first and I’ll follow</p><p>you.” </p><p>SO THEY ascended the ladder and </p><p>gained the deck, and the ferry-boat </p><p>pilot, seeing them safe if soppy, </p><p>swore with remarkable enthusiasm, put his </p><p>helm hard-a-starboard, and edged around </p><p>to the rear of the tow. </p><p> Gray-eyes looked at the girl who was</p><p>standing on the deck. She was a splendid </p><p>creature, with raven hair coiled braid upon </p><p>braid upon the back of her head, glorious </p><p>eyes with tawny glints in the depths of </p><p>them, sun-tanned cheeks through which the </p><p>roses glowed, lips of scarlet, and shining, </p><p>strong teeth. A soft felt hat was pinned </p><p>to the masses of her hair and a canvas waist </p><p>with a wide brown collar fell away from her </p><p>glorious neck and rested loosely upon her </p><p>full bosom across which her bare brown arms </p><p>were folded. With her canvas skirt snap- </p><p>ping around her in the brisk river breeze </p><p>and the low western sunbeams slanting </p><p>down upon her over the irregular sky-line </p><p>of New York, with the western windows all </p><p>aflame and the scarlet clouds fluttering like </p><p>pennants in the amethystine depths, Gray- </p><p>eyes concluded that he had never seen a </p><p>picture so magnificent. </p><p> Further thought upon the subject waf</p><p>arrested by a vigorous smite on the nose. </p><p>The young man's eyes blazed with anger </p><p>and, clutching the brother of his adventure </p><p>by the wet front of his diamond-decked </p><p>waistcoat with his left hand, he drew back </p><p>his right hand to return the blow he had </p><p>received so unexpectedly. The short man </p><p>threw up his hands to guard his head in </p><p>a manner that indicated some familiarity </p><p>with the rules of the game, but the fingers </p><p>chat gripped his chest were fingers of steel </p><p>Dad and Destiny </p><p>223</p><p>and he was helpless because of the long </p><p>reach of the outstretched arm. Gray-eyes </p><p>curbed his anger instantly and instead of driv- </p><p>ing in his clenched right hand, he opened it </p><p>and rubbed his bruised nose with it. </p><p> The girl said nothing, but looked from</p><p>one to the other curiously. </p><p> “What did you do that for?” Gray-eyes</p><p>asked. </p><p> “For what?” echoed the other in pure</p><p>amazement. “Hey, bo, see yon Kelly on </p><p>the sad sea waves? It cost me six only last </p><p>night! And on the deck of that ferry-boat </p><p>is a black broadcloth coat, 1911 model, in- </p><p>side of which is my gilt timer with wheels </p><p>that go round and round, price one hundred </p><p>and fifty! Lost, bo! Lost! And just be- </p><p>cause you wanted to get as much water out- </p><p>side as you had booze inside, and I thought </p><p>it was up to me to pull you out of the wet! </p><p>Do you think I’d let any one come across </p><p>'.vith a play like that and no come-back?” </p><p> “You tried to save my life?” said Gray-</p><p>eyes. </p><p> “Nix on the melodrama,” protested the</p><p>other. “And by the way, you’re rumpling </p><p>up my shirt-front something awful. You </p><p>can throw off your clutch—I’ve decided to </p><p>let you live.” </p><p> “Thank you,” said Gray-eyes, grinning</p><p>as he released him. </p><p> The short man raised an inquiring thumb</p><p>and two inquiring* fingers to his scarf-pin. </p><p>Then he dropped his chin on his soppy </p><p>shirt-front and deliberately counted the </p><p>buttons on his waistcoat. </p><p> “You didn’t take anything away but</p><p>your hand,” he said at last, approvingly. </p><p> The younger man flushed. “I am not a</p><p>thief,” he said coldly. </p><p> “That’s what I said,” assented the short</p><p>man tranquilly. “Now if you’ll tell me </p><p>your name, I’ll introduce you to this lovely </p><p>skirt.” </p><p> “My name is Harold Armitage.”</p><p> “Oh, Harold!” murmured the short man</p><p>joyously. “Madam,” he went on, turning </p><p>with a bow to the brown-eyed girl, “allow </p><p>me to present muh moist friend, Mr. Har- </p><p>old Armitage. I’ve known him at least a </p><p>quarter of an hour on land and sea, and it </p><p>has been some crowded. Mr. Armitage, </p><p>this is Miss— Name, please! ” </p><p> “My name is Elaine,” said the girl</p><p>gravely. </p><p> “Oof!” grunted the short man, catching</p><p>his breath. “Ah! Mr. Armitage this is </p><p>Miss Elaine. You’ve got to hand it to her</p><p>for being some good-looker, and her name </p><p>listens like a book. And now, Miss Elaine, </p><p>would you .mind presenting me to your </p><p>friend? We have met somewhere, but have </p><p>had no formal introduction.” </p><p> The girl looked at him, unsmiling.</p><p>“Name, please?” she asked. </p><p> “I might tell you it was Adelbert Percy</p><p>Fitz-Fitz, but it ain’t,” he answered. “I’m </p><p>just Jake Buchmufler.” </p><p> “Mr. Armitage, Mr. Buchmuller,” said</p><p>the girl seriously. “If you gentlemen,” she </p><p>went on, “will sit down on these hatches a </p><p>few minutes, I will see what can be done in </p><p>the way of dry garments.” </p><p> She turned on her heel and swung off</p><p>down the deck. Jake looked after her, ap- </p><p>probation written all over his expressive </p><p>features </p><p> “If,” he sighed at last, “that skirt is the</p><p>captain’s little daughter, lash me to the </p><p>mast, matey; I’ll never desert the ship!” </p><p>Harold nodded. </p><p> Jake plunged his hands into his trousers</p><p>pockets. Instantly he emitted a loud wail. </p><p> “Oi-yoi! Oi-yoi!” he moaned, seating</p><p>himself upon the hatch covers and rocking </p><p>his body to and fro. “It’s gone, it’s gone! ” </p><p>“What’s gone?” asked Harold. </p><p> “ Muh bankroll! Muh lovely little bunch</p><p>of money! Oi-yoi! Oi-yoi! ” </p><p> “How much was in it?”</p><p> “Five hundred and thirty dollars!”</p><p>Harold drew from his pocket a package </p><p>of moist bills and began to count: </p><p> “Fifty, a hundred, one-ten, twenty,</p><p>thirty, fifty, seventy, eighty, two-hundred, </p><p>two-ten, two-fifteen, two-seventeen—two </p><p>hundred and seventeen dollars.” He looked </p><p>up. “I’ll have to owe you the balance; </p><p>this is all I have,” he said. “And heaven </p><p>knows when I am going to get any more!” </p><p>he added. </p><p> “Not on your silhouette!” shouted Jake,</p><p>indignantly waving back the prouered bills. </p><p>“I’m no cheap sport, kid. You can lend </p><p>me a twenty to tide me over, if you care to, </p><p>but that’ll be about all in that line. As for </p><p>what’s gone, it’s gone, and there’s no divi- </p><p>dends in weeps over burnt money, as the </p><p>Bible says. But tell me, did deponent truly </p><p>state or were you stalling on the name- </p><p>plate?” </p><p> “Eh?”</p><p> “That Harold Armitage business. Is</p><p>that what they call you back home? ” </p><p>224 </p><p>Adventure</p><p> Harold laughed. “ Yes,” he said, “that’s</p><p>my real name. You’ve probably heard of </p><p>dad. He is Thomas Armitage.” </p><p> “Not Armitage &amp; Barnes’ Frazzled</p><p>Friskies? ” </p><p> “U-hum. I’m the son of ‘the King of</p><p>Breakfast Foods.’ I was going to say son </p><p>and heir, but we had a row yesterday and I </p><p>was thrown out of house, home, allowance </p><p>and will. Dad has a real warm, red- </p><p>headed temper.” </p><p> “Now Harold—you’ll excuse me for</p><p>pulling on the front doorbell but I do love </p><p>to say Harold—I know you ought to have </p><p>your nut examined. Getting a souse on and </p><p>jumping into a wet river is just anindica- </p><p>iion, but having a serious fight with pater- </p><p>nal millions is proof positive of bats in the </p><p>loft. Did you ever try earning a living?” </p><p>“No, not yet.” </p><p> “It’s some more complicated than run-</p><p>ning an automobile. A fellow that doesn’t </p><p>have to shouldn’t jump into it without seri- </p><p>ous consideration. What are you going </p><p>to do?” </p><p> “I don’t know. I have just come back</p><p>from Paris where some money was spent </p><p>teaching me to paint pictures. But I’m </p><p>afraid I couldn’t sell them.” </p><p> “Leave that to me, bo. You paint and</p><p>I’ll be the selling end. What do you say to </p><p>the firm of Armitage &amp; Buchmuller?” </p><p>Harold clasped Jake’s outstretched hand </p><p>and shook it heartily. </p><p> “You’re a pretty good sort, Buchmuller,"</p><p>he said. “We’ll try it out. What’s your </p><p>plan of campaign?” </p><p> “Can you paint human things?’’</p><p> “Yes—you mean portraits?”</p><p> “Then Job Number i for you is to paint</p><p>a picture of Peaches. If I don’t sell it to a </p><p>complexion-cream outfit I’ll eat it. Here </p><p>she comes now. Just let me make all the </p><p>arrangements.” </p><p> ELAINE came swinging aft, her</p><p>arms full of check jumpers and blue </p><p>— denim trousers. Jake advanced to </p><p>meet her. </p><p> “Miss Elaine,” he asked, “are you the</p><p>skipper’s daughter? ” </p><p>“No,” she answered, “I am the skipper." </p><p>“Oof!” exclaimed Jake. “Well, Cap, </p><p>we would very much like to take the trip </p><p>to Buffalo with you. How much would it </p><p>cost us, American plan?” </p><p> For the first tune Elaine showed some</p><p>slight signs of confusion. “Well, I—I don't </p><p>know,” she stammered. “We should be</p><p>glad to have you of course, but-” </p><p> “Perhaps,” interjected Harold, “Miss</p><p>Elaine is er-er unchaperoned and-” </p><p> “No, that’s not it,” she said, turning to</p><p>him. “My brother is on board with his </p><p>wife and her sister and a young man friend; </p><p>but you see we never have taken passengers </p><p>before and-” </p><p> “You don’t know w'hat to charge,” Jake</p><p>broke in. “All right, Captain, suppose we </p><p>take half the railroad fare from New York to </p><p>Buffalo for a basis and add ten a week for </p><p>the eats and berths.” </p><p> “That would do very well,” said Elaine.</p><p>“Follow me, please.” </p><p> She led them to the bow of the barge and</p><p>down a companion ladder to the main cabin. </p><p>Jake drew in his breath quickly as they en- </p><p>tered. A handsome rug lay upon the floor, </p><p>silken curtains of Nile green draped the </p><p>little ports, and a small piano stood in one </p><p>comer. There were cosy wicker lounging- </p><p>chairs and divans, a reading-table of pol- </p><p>ished oak and a revolving bookcase whose </p><p>shelves were full of handsomely bound </p><p>volumes. </p><p> Some embroidery lay in a woman’s work-</p><p>basket on top of the bookcase and a </p><p>dozen magazines were heaped- upon the </p><p>table. From this compartment a com? </p><p>panionway led aft, and on each side of it </p><p>were neat little white staterooms with com- </p><p>fortable rocking-chairs and cosy brass beds. </p><p>Into one of these the girl ushered the two </p><p>young men. </p><p> “This is our only spare room,” she said.</p><p>“ You will have to share it.” She deposited </p><p>her armful of clothing on the bed and went </p><p>on: “The dining-room is at the other end </p><p>of the boat. When you have changed your </p><p>clothing come right aft and meet the others, </p><p>We have dinner at six.” She flashed a </p><p>golden smile at them and vanished. </p><p> Jake turned a dazed look upon Harold.</p><p>“Would you mind pinching me., bo?” he </p><p>asked feebly. </p><p> “Why, what's the matter?” Harold</p><p>asked. </p><p> “I just want to make sure I am awake,"</p><p>responded Buchmuller. “Recent experi- </p><p>ences suggest to me that I’m either in a </p><p>dream or pleasantly dippy, like the bug </p><p>who has a kink that he’s John D. Rocke- </p><p>feller. I’m the little fellow who tells real </p><p>estate men they ought to advertise. For </p><p>Dad and Destiny </p><p>225 </p><p>ten years I have been blowing all the sur-</p><p>plus earnings of muh business in a foolish </p><p>endeavor to put a good one over on the </p><p>bookies. Yesterday, when I’m down to </p><p>hard-pan, behold, bo! they really win at </p><p>big money and I sail home with a thousand </p><p>in muh kick. Muh for the realization of </p><p>muh dreams, new clothes, flashes for the </p><p>necktie and vest buttons, the gold tick- </p><p>tick! </p><p> “But see how wealth takes wings and the</p><p>tide of fortune, taken at the flood, biffs you </p><p>most unexpected and cruel. Riches this </p><p>morning, and the fishes playing with muh </p><p>bank-roll before the sun sets! In the water, </p><p>out of the water, and up we come on a </p><p>canal-boat which a fairy with a wide smile </p><p>presto-changos into the St. Regis. Now </p><p>Harold—how I love that name!—are you </p><p>sure that we’re awake? ” </p><p> “Quite sure,” Harold answered with a</p><p>laugh. “This is a nice little stateroom, old </p><p>fellow, but it’s not the St. Regis.” </p><p> “You’ve been in the St. Regis?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Have you ever been on a canaller?”</p><p> “No.”</p><p> “Well, I have. And, take it from me,</p><p>bo, that you may know that this is not the </p><p>St. Regis, but I know it isn’t any canaller </p><p>either! Besides which these blue-jeans are </p><p>too brand new to look the part. And no </p><p>bloomin’ low-bridge expert tramps the tow- </p><p>path in fifteen-dollar suits of underwear!” </p><p> This last observation was due to the dis-</p><p>covery that two comfortable suits of under- </p><p>clothing had been laid out upon the coun- </p><p>terpane. </p><p> Harold did not answer. He was too busy</p><p>divesting himself of his wet garments and </p><p>replacing them with the dry, warm habili- </p><p>ments so kindly provided. </p><p> “A little scant, but nice and comfy,” he</p><p>commented, sitting on the bed and ruefully </p><p>surveying the hiatus between the rims of </p><p>his trouser legs and the tops of his misfit </p><p>shoes. </p><p> “You’ll have to put flounces on those,</p><p>bo,” remarked Jake, bending over to fold </p><p>up neatly the surplus length of his own </p><p>garments. “Now,” he observed, as he </p><p>stood up straight and pirouetted up and </p><p>down the cabin, “see that neat and fash- </p><p>ionable cuff? You may have it on me for </p><p>name and lineage, Harold, but as a nob- </p><p>by dresser—fade, bo, fade, I’ve got you </p><p>skinned and on the pan!” </p><p> Harold paused with a comb stuck in his</p><p>hair.</p><p> “By the way, partner,” he said, “we for-</p><p>got one item in our business arrangements. </p><p>A painter must have paint to paint.” </p><p> “Sounds like a music-hall gag or a</p><p>conundrum,” mumbled Jake, taking his </p><p>scarf-pin out of his mouth and fastening </p><p>the neck of his jumper with it. “ However, </p><p>don’t let it spoil your digestion; we’ll tie </p><p>up at some river town and you can go ashore </p><p>and buy the paint.” </p><p> Rather timidly they made their way to</p><p>the after deckhouse. A big oak dining-table </p><p>occupied the center of it and a handsome </p><p>sideboard stood against the bulkhead. </p><p> “Get hep to the sidebar,” murmured</p><p>Jake to himself. “ Cut glass, too!” </p><p> Two young women and two men were in</p><p>the room with Elaine as the guests entered. </p><p>She introduced one of the men as' her </p><p>brother, Mr. Daniels, and the other as Mr. </p><p>Brough. Daniels looked enough like Elaine </p><p>to confirm the introductory explanation and </p><p>Mr. Brough was a lean young chap with a </p><p>sandy mustache and a languid manner. </p><p>Mrs. Daniels was a blue-eyed, golden- </p><p>haired matron of twenty-five, and Polly </p><p>Hawkins, her sister, was a slim eighteen- </p><p>year-old lassie in a tidy checked kitchen </p><p>apron. </p><p> The men were clothed in blue-jeans and</p><p>jumpers and the women in canvas blouses </p><p>and skirts. Harold and Jake were cordially </p><p>welcomed and took the seats Elaine as- </p><p>signed them at the table. Their afternoon’s </p><p>experience had put a razor-edge on their </p><p>appetites and they thoroughly enjoyed the </p><p>substantial dinner set before them. At the </p><p>conclusion of the meal Daniels reached into </p><p>the sideboard and drew forth a box of </p><p>cigars. </p><p> “We generally smoke these after din-</p><p>ner,” he explained as he passed the box to </p><p>Jake. “During the day we smoke corn- </p><p>cobs. I’ll put a couple and a box of tobacco </p><p>in your room. If you don’t care for the </p><p>pipe, however, you can always find the </p><p>cigars in this cupboard.” </p><p>AS THEY pulled comforters over </p><p>them in their cosy stateroom that </p><p>evening Harold concluded that ca- </p><p>nal-boat life was the most joyous life a </p><p>human being could live. They had spent </p><p>the evening lounging and reading in the </p><p>forward cabin. Jake had entertained them </p><p>226 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>with several popular songs sung to Polly’s </p><p>rattling accompaniment, and, best of all,</p><p>Harold and Elaine had had a tramp around </p><p>the deck in the moonlight that- bathed </p><p>bank and boat, darkling shore and spark- </p><p>ling river. She was not too communicative </p><p>about her business, but he gathered that the </p><p>barge had come down to New York flour- </p><p>laden and was going' back empty. It </p><p>struck him that there was some difference </p><p>between his hosts and the crews of the </p><p>craft lashed alongside, but he dismissed the </p><p>question with the reflection that canal society </p><p>had its gradations like all other societies. </p><p>And truly, Elaine had wonderful eyes! </p><p> Jake nudged him in the ribs. “What did</p><p>you fight with your dad about? ” he asked. </p><p>“Uh?” mumbled Harold. </p><p> “Why did you leave home and all the</p><p>money—a skirt? ” </p><p> “Something like,” yawned Harold. “He</p><p>wanted to marry me to his partner’s </p><p>daughter ’n’ I—was—umble, umble-” </p><p> “You don’t tell me?” snorted Jake in</p><p>deep disgust. “Well, a guy that can go to </p><p>sleep telling how he lost a few million </p><p>doesn’t deserve to have money! Ugh!” </p><p>And Jake fell asleep also. </p><p>“HEIGH-HO!” exclaimed Jake, </p><p>as they turned out to the tune of a </p><p>clamorous tom-tom at six the fol- </p><p>lowing morning, “how do you like life on </p><p>the bounding marine? ” </p><p> “All right!” answered Harold, rubbing</p><p>sleep-heavy lids. “But why all the racket </p><p>so early in the morning? Is the ship afire? ” </p><p>“Nay, bo; it's pipe all hands to grog— </p><p>I mean to grub,” Jake explained. “And— </p><p>loot! loot! little bright-eyes—on this marvel </p><p>of a canaller they supply passengers with a </p><p>razor!” </p><p> They shaved rapidly and hurried aft. In</p><p>the dining-room Polly, again wrapped in her </p><p>kitchen apron, and Mrs. Daniels, simi- </p><p>larly swathed, were skipping back and </p><p>forth with steaming platters of buckwheat </p><p>cakes while Elaine could be glimpsed in the </p><p>galley beyond, transferring slices of red and </p><p>white bacon from the frying pan to a mam- </p><p>moth serving-dish. Daniels was pouring </p><p>coffee and Brough was dragging the chairs </p><p>up to the table. </p><p> “Hi there, Armitage! Get that big knife</p><p>and cut the bread!” yelled Daniels cheer- </p><p>fully. “ Buchmuller, help Polly in with the </p><p>buckwheats!” </p><p> Soon they were all at the table eating</p><p>with a North River appetite of which Armi- </p><p>tage w'as rather ashamed, but Jake was as </p><p>proud as a peacock.</p><p> “Now what have we to do, Cap?” he</p><p>asked of Elaine. “We want to be par t of the </p><p>crew and jump in and work with the rest, </p><p>you know.” </p><p> Elaine seemed at a loss. Her brother</p><p>hurried to the rescue. </p><p> “As we are traveling empty there is really</p><p>nothing to do, you know,” he said. “We </p><p>generally sit around the deck and read and </p><p>smoke—that is Brough and I smoke—and </p><p>watch the scenery. You see?” </p><p> “Yes,” said Jake, “I see. How could a</p><p>fellow help seeing,” he went on under his </p><p>breath, “when it’s as clear as mud?” </p><p> As they went on deck he observed a lean</p><p>person whose long legs were encased in </p><p>cowhide boots and whose chin-whisker of </p><p>red and gray looked like the spike on a </p><p>picket fence. This person was smoking a </p><p>black clay pipe and leaning his back against </p><p>the tiller. </p><p> “Who’s your steersman, bo?” Jake</p><p>whispered in Daniels’ ear. </p><p> A slight flush crept into the young man’s</p><p>cheeks. </p><p> “He belongs on the next boat,” he ex-</p><p>plained. “He comes over to give us a hand </p><p>in a neighborly kind of way, you know, </p><p>when we’re busy. How are you, Hiram?” </p><p> The lean person straightened up stiffly</p><p>and touched his brow with a weatherbeaten </p><p>fore-finger. </p><p> “Good morning—”</p><p> Polly, who stood beside them, placed her</p><p>hand on her heart. </p><p> “—sir,” said the helmsman.</p><p> “Ahhhhh!” sighed Polly softly.</p><p> But Jake didn’t seem to have noticed</p><p>anything. He followed Elaine and Harold </p><p>forward, looking down at the deck. To </p><p>himself he was saying, “For the love of </p><p>Mike, what are we up against?” </p><p>THAT night Elaine and Harold sat </p><p>on the hatch-covers, the girl resting </p><p>her elbows on her knees and clasping </p><p>her hands as she looked up into his face. </p><p>The lights of Saugerties twinkled off the </p><p>port quarter and a rippling streamer of </p><p>silver moonlight lay like a bar upon the </p><p>river. Armitage had just told the girl of </p><p>the quarrel with his father. </p><p> “ But why does he insist chat you marry</p><p>Dad and Destiny </p><p>her?” she asked. “Is it because she has— </p><p>has money?” </p><p> “Oh, no,” he answered quickly. “Dad</p><p>has a bunch of it himself and doesn’t care </p><p>about that end of it. But you see her father</p><p>and he were mining partners years ago and </p><p>made their first big strike together and they </p><p>have been brothers in business ever since. </p><p>It seems that when both of us were babies </p><p>they made it up between them that we were </p><p>to marry.” </p><p> “Well, why don’t you marry her? Isn’t</p><p>she a nice girl?” </p><p> “Oh, I suppose she’s nice enough—I’ve</p><p>never seen her,” he answered. “You see, </p><p>he took care of the Western end, the manu- </p><p>facturing, and dad ran the advertising and </p><p>selling in New York, and then when I was </p><p>fifteen I was packed off to boarding school </p><p>and later to college and then to Paris to </p><p>cultivate what I thought was a talent for </p><p>painting. I have just come home and find </p><p>that he has it all arranged that I am to </p><p>marry a girl who probably has as little </p><p>taste for the thing as I have. He insisted, </p><p>I objected, there were fire-crackers and I </p><p>got out.”_ </p><p> “Is that the only reason you did'not want</p><p>to marry her? ” </p><p> Harold lifted his glance and looked</p><p>straight into Elaine’s brown eyes. </p><p> “That was the only reason,” he said.</p><p>“‘Was?’” she repeated softly, looking </p><p>out over the waters. </p><p> “Yes,” he answered, “was. There is an-</p><p>other reason now.” </p><p> “What is her name?” Elaine asked.</p><p>Armitage started. “You wouldn’t really </p><p>like me to tell you that, now would you?” </p><p>he asked quietly. </p><p> “No,” she answered. “I should think</p><p>you horrid if you did.” </p><p> She looked a while at the red dot of the</p><p>port lantern. Then she turned her eyes ha </p><p>the direction of the thin yellow streamers </p><p>that escaped from the cabin windows through </p><p>which escaped also Jake’s gay voice raised </p><p>in song, and the tinkle of Polly’s vivacious </p><p>obligato. </p><p> “The other reason?" she said softly, her</p><p>lashes falling. </p><p> “Why, Elaine, you are the other reason,”</p><p>he said, looking up at her frankly. “I do </p><p>not want to be offensive and I haven’t any </p><p>hope, but it won’t hurt you to know, and </p><p>perhaps it will help me. If I were any </p><p>good—if I had been taught how to make a </p><p>living instead of painting pictures no one </p><p>would buy—why, I’d try to make you love </p><p>me and marry me, but— Oh, do not </p><p>think too little of me, Elaine, because you </p><p>are a splendid, competent worker of the </p><p>world, and I am a good-for-nothing. I’ll</p><p>learn how—in time.” </p><p> “Your father may relent,” the girl sug-</p><p>gested, her lashes still brushing her cheeks. </p><p> “You don’t know my dad,” Harold an-</p><p>swered, shaking his head. </p><p> “But I think you can win out alone,” she</p><p>said, looking up at him suddenly. </p><p> Harold looked into her face in a frank,</p><p>level-eyed way he had. </p><p> “You are right,” he said without the</p><p>slightest suggestion of a boast in tone or </p><p>manner, “I can. But,” he added, “it </p><p>wouldn’t be the square thing to ask any </p><p>girl to bet on me.” </p><p> Even in the pale moonlight he could see.</p><p>the cloud of color that surged into her facc </p><p>as she bent her head and whispered: </p><p> “I would be willing to bet on you,</p><p>Harold!” </p><p> The singing had ceased in the forward</p><p>cabin. Jake Buchmuller stepped out on </p><p>deck, the red tip of his cigar brightening </p><p>and fading, and the smoke of it curling </p><p>back over his shoulder. He looked at the </p><p>little tugboats ahead and then swept a care- </p><p>less glance back at the barges strung out </p><p>astern. Something dark against the white </p><p>hatchcovers, on the port side amidships, </p><p>arrested his wandering glance. </p><p> “Is it one or are it two?” he murmured</p><p>after a minute of careful scrutiny. </p><p> “It are two,” he answered his own ques-</p><p>tion a minute later, and discreetly turned </p><p>his eyes ahead. </p><p> “That young man,” he remarked con-</p><p>fidentially to the hawser-ring at his feet, </p><p>“is some rapid, even if his name is Harold. </p><p>In ten minutes he makes a life-long friend </p><p>of me and now he’s kissing the Captain of </p><p>this blooming ship!” </p><p> Having delivered himself of which Jake</p><p>went below and turned in. </p><p>ALL the way up the river Mr. </p><p>Buchmuller’s crowning joy was the </p><p>enthusiasm of Polly. That young </p><p>lady was just bursting with information </p><p>concerning the canal-boat trade, and Jake </p><p>drank it in as the dry earth drinks up the </p><p>Summer showers. </p><p> “Now what wras it you told me you were</p><p>Wm </p><p>228 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>carrying last trip?” he encouraged her one </p><p>morning as he aided her in the culinary </p><p>task of peeling potatoes. </p><p> “Lobsters,” answered Polly demurely,</p><p>tossing a denuded Murphy into a capacious</p><p>sauce-pan. </p><p> Jake looked at her with baby eyes.</p><p> “How very interesting!” he said.</p><p> “Yes,” said Polly, “it was a great sight</p><p>to look down in the hold and see them </p><p>fighting, millions and millions of them.” </p><p> “It must have been,” Jake replied with</p><p>conviction. </p><p> “Yes,” Polly went on with growing en-</p><p>thusiasm," and one night they er — muti- </p><p>nied.” </p><p> “ Mutinied? ” gasped Jake.</p><p> “ Um, ” said Polly. “ They all came clam-</p><p>bering up on deck and we barred ourselves </p><p>in the cabin and drove them back at the </p><p>point of our pistols!” </p><p> “Gee!” exclaimed Jake.</p><p> Polly sighed. “The trip before that</p><p>wasn’t very romantic,” she said. </p><p> “No?” queried Jake.</p><p> “No,” said Polly. “We had on board a</p><p>hundred thousand hogsheads of flour. It </p><p>took us girls two days to get it on board.” </p><p> “Gracious, how do you do such hard</p><p>work and keep your hands so nice and </p><p>soft?” </p><p> “Oh,” said Polly, “we always wear our</p><p>gloves when we’re handling hogsheads, of </p><p>course!” </p><p> “Of course; how stupid of me!” said Jake.</p><p> Elaine’s appearance in the cabin stopped</p><p>the flow of Polly’s eloquence and Jake re- </p><p>treated to his room. From the little port </p><p>of that apartment strange, muffled sounds </p><p>issued, and the skipper of the barge along- </p><p>side, peering through, saw a short man try- </p><p>ing to swallow a feather pillow and making </p><p>a terrible pother about it. </p><p>THE flotilla halted at Albany, and </p><p>next afternoon, just as they were </p><p>about to resume the journey, the </p><p>crew of the grain-barge were startled by the </p><p>wild croak of a horn and the roar of an un- </p><p>muffled six-cylinder. A big touring-car </p><p>tore down the dock and pulled up with a </p><p>creaking of protesting brakes at the barge’s </p><p>side. Out of the tonneau jumped a ruddy, </p><p>spectacled old gentleman with streaming </p><p>gray sidewhiskers. With surprising agility </p><p>he leaped over the string-piece and landed </p><p>upon the deck. </p><p> “Dad!” gasped Harold, in blank amaze-</p><p>ment. </p><p> “Hello, you obstinate young scamp!”</p><p>his father saluted. “I knew you’d knucklfc </p><p>under to the old man—they all do when he </p><p>puts his foot down, you bet your life! Bui </p><p>how did you get him on the barge, Edie?”</p><p>Elaine looked up, her face crimson and </p><p>her hand reaching out in.appeal toward </p><p>Harold. Instead of answering the old gen- </p><p>tleman she spoke to his son. </p><p> “There isn’t any Elaine, Harold,” she</p><p>said. “I’m Edith Barnes.” </p><p> Harold looked at her with dazed eyes.</p><p>“And all this-” he said, looking around </p><p>at the barge. </p><p> “Why, it’s simple enough,” she answered.</p><p>“This barge belongs to your father and </p><p>mine. Richie and Nell and Polly and I </p><p>were tired of town and thought a canal- </p><p>boat trip would be a delightful lark. Dick </p><p>had the boat altered a little and furnished, </p><p>and we were just starting on our trip when </p><p>you came on board, rather unceremoniously. </p><p>When I heard your name it occurred to me </p><p>that it would be a splendid chance to find </p><p>out what kind of chap father had picked </p><p>out for me—you will forgive me for fooling </p><p>you, won’t you' Harold? ” </p><p> “Forgive you, dear girl! Why it’s been</p><p>fine! But—but how did you know about </p><p>it, father?” </p><p> The elder Armitage plunged his hand</p><p>into his breast pocket and drew forth a </p><p>telegraphic dispatch. </p><p> “How did I know about it?” he cried,</p><p>thrusting the paper into Harold’s hand. </p><p>“Didn’t you send me this?” </p><p> With their heads together Harold and</p><p>Elaine read: </p><p> You win. I have just become engaged to Edith</p><p>Barnes. Bat the corpulent calf on the brow and </p><p>chase me a check.	Harold.</p><p> “I was so—so—so dingbusted glad that I</p><p>hustled up on a special myself, just to see </p><p>if it was true!” exploded Mr. Armitage. </p><p> But Edith had turned an accusing eye</p><p>upon Jake. He threw up his hands. </p><p> “Guilty!” he confessed. “I thought the</p><p>old guy might be worried, and what was the </p><p>use keeping him on the griddle?” </p><p>“ But how did you know? Did Polly—?” </p><p>“Don’t pass it up to Polly! She’s been </p><p>having the time of her life kidding me, </p><p>haven’t you, Polly? As for the engagement </p><p>part, why, Harold has been* murmuring </p><p>The Seeds of Destruction </p><p>229 </p><p> •chings in his sleep. And as for the rest, you</p><p> ahoiid have heard the nice early morning</p><p> chats I have had with old Chinny-chin-chin</p><p> •- who plays with the tiller. He told me how'</p><p> much per he got for being so neighborly</p><p> and who paid him. And then it wras an</p><p> oversight, Cap, to leave that plate on the</p><p> t'iller-post!” He pointed to a nickel-plated</p><p> sign which bore the inscription:</p><p>Armitage &amp; Barnes—Barge No. 12 </p><p> “And I thought I had you fooled as badly</p><p>as Harold was!” Polly complained in </p><p>heart-broken tones. </p><p> “Oi-yoi!” chortled Jake. “Living the</p><p>simple canal-boat life with perfectos for </p><p>after dinner and ten-dollar-a-pound mixture </p><p>for our humble corn-cob pipes! Maiden, 1 </p><p>may look like a simple child of nature from </p><p>the far-off reservation, but believe me, my </p><p>wigwam’s hard by little old Broadway!” </p><p>THE </p><p>A *GRAY </p><p>VA DARIEN had waited dinner </p><p>until after nine o’clock and still </p><p>her brother Carlile had neither </p><p>turned up nor sent the usual mes- </p><p>sage explaining the delay; he had not even </p><p>’phoned her to expect it. </p><p> It was so unusual and so unlike him that</p><p>Eva began to feel vaguely anxious. Then, </p><p>at ten-thirty, the vagueness became a </p><p>certainty—acute—intense—unbearable. So </p><p>much so that at ten-forty-five she rang up </p><p>his clubs, only to ascertain that he had been </p><p>at neither of them at any time that evening. </p><p> At one of them—the Aviators’—the com-</p><p>missionaire said that Mr. Darien had been </p><p>expected there to meet Lord Fenton Henry </p><p>at seven o’clock and that Lord Fenton had </p><p>left a .message with him in case Mr. Darien </p><p>had been delayed and should turn up later. </p><p>He repeated the message over the wire at </p><p>Eva’s request, and as she listened she sud- </p><p>denly realized that the situation was alarm- </p><p>ingly serious. </p><p> For Lord Fenton Henry could do great</p><p>things for those in whose favor he interested </p><p>himself, and the message the commissionaire </p><p>repeated was of such tremendous conse- </p><p>quence to Carlile’s future career that only </p><p>a man who was either a fool or else prevented </p><p>by some extraordinary happening w'ould </p><p>have permitted himself to be deterred from </p><p>keeping an appointment of such impor- </p><p>tance and magnitude. And Carlile was </p><p>no fool. </p><p> With beating heart and swimming brain</p><p>his sister hung up the receiver and sank back </p><p>inertly in her chair. What had happened? </p><p>What could have happened? </p><p> What was to be done? Ring up the hos-</p><p>pitals in case there should have been an </p><p>accident? But surely if there had been she </p><p>would have heard of it ere this. Carlile was </p><p>a public man, secretary to Sir Dean Dens-</p><p>hain of the Secret Service, known to Scot- </p><p>land Yard and every possible constable in </p><p>London. Sir Dean! Why, perhaps Sir </p><p>I* </p><p>SEEDS OF DESTRUCTION </p><p>GHOST''STORY Cy MURIEL A POLLEXFEN </p><p>230 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Dean would know something! Or at least </p><p>he would be able to advise her. </p><p> She picked off the receiver again and</p><p>listened impatiently for the operator’s voice. </p><p>It was fully three minutes before she got </p><p>through and the tension of her nerves was </p><p>growing tighter every second. She held the </p><p>line while the servant made inquiries, and </p><p>it was with a mixture of gratification and </p><p>alarm that she heard Sir Dean himself reply </p><p>to her after a short interval. </p><p> “Is that Miss Darien? Good-evening.</p><p>My man tells me you are asking for your </p><p>brother. But surely he is at home? No, </p><p>no, quite close here—just across the road— </p><p>the Foreign Office, to be exact. Yes, he told </p><p>me he was to meet Lord Fenton at seven </p><p>o’clock. I remember commenting on it and </p><p>saying it would probably lead to a good </p><p>thing. Left here a little before six. Yes, I </p><p>admit it is strange, but do not permit your- </p><p>self to get anxious just yet. He may have </p><p>been detained—he may have forgotten the </p><p>appointment.” </p><p> “Oh, no, Sir Dean! It was prominent in</p><p>his mind from the moment it was made. I </p><p>know he was building so much on a meeting </p><p>with Lord Fenton, though I did not know it </p><p>was for to-night. He caw’i have forgotten it! ” </p><p> “I must confess it is not likely—still-”</p><p> “Was there no answer required to your</p><p>errand, Sir Dean? Do you know if he ever </p><p>went to the F. 0.?’' </p><p> Eva, as she put the question, could have</p><p>sworn that she heard a peculiar click come </p><p>from Sir Dean’s end of the wire—a sharp </p><p>click as though he had suddenly gritted his </p><p>teeth together in quick annoyance. </p><p> There was a perceptible pause before his</p><p>answer came, and when it did come it was </p><p>given slowly and haltingly, as though he </p><p>were weighing most carefully every word— </p><p>giving each word a momentous meaning and </p><p>gravity. </p><p> “To be perfectly frank with you, Miss</p><p>Darien, your question has startled me. </p><p>Your brother left me with a wallet of papers </p><p>for the Foreign Office at about ten or five </p><p>minutes to six. At six o’clock a telephone </p><p>message came through that the papers were</p><p>safely delivered. I was in rather a hurry </p><p>and did nothing more than receive the </p><p>message. I thought at the time it was </p><p>Darien’s voice—Darien in a hurry-” </p><p> “And now?” asked Eva sharply.</p><p> “And now I’m not so sure. I should not</p><p>like to swear to it-” </p><p> Eva uttered a gasp of dismay—then her</p><p>quick brain leaped to a sudden under- </p><p>standing. </p><p> “One question, Sir Bean! If no message</p><p>had come through at all, would you have </p><p>made inquiries at the time? ” </p><p> Sir Dean hesitated for the barest fraction</p><p>of a second. Then: “Yes, Miss Darien, I </p><p>would have made inquiries. It was ar- </p><p>ranged between us that your brother was to </p><p>telephone me on the private wire so soon as </p><p>the papers were in the care of Mr. Follett. </p><p>If no message had come through I should </p><p>have been uneasy.” </p><p>SwS EVA put up the receiver with a chill </p><p>iim£i *ear growing up round her heart. </p><p> Her worst forebodings were becom-</p><p>ing stronger and stronger every moment. </p><p>Something had happened to her brother. </p><p>Even in Sir Dean’s studied sentences she </p><p>had discerned an underlying current of </p><p>alarm. Then there was the message pur- </p><p>porting to be from her brother and in his </p><p>voice. What could that mean? Was it </p><p>Car who had sent that message, Car him- </p><p>self, or was it part of the mystery? Had </p><p>some one imitated his voice? But if so— </p><p>why? What purpose was it to serve? How </p><p>could any one know of the arrangement to </p><p>inform Sir Dean of the safety of the papers? </p><p>How could any one—any outsider—use the </p><p>private wire of the F. 0.? </p><p> In an agony of apprehension she sprang</p><p>up and walked to the door with the in- </p><p>tention of getting into some outdoor things </p><p>so as to be ready in case of emergency. For </p><p>by now she dreaded she knew not what— </p><p>the worst—the unknown worst! </p><p> But as she touched the door-handle the</p><p>sudden sharp tinkle of the telephone bell </p><p>rang out its brusk summons and she flew </p><p>back to the table in the window in a passion </p><p>of expectation. </p><p> “Yes—yes—are you there? Yes, I am</p><p>Miss Darien-” </p><p> She gripped the receiver and held it to</p><p>her ears, and as she listened her face grew </p><p>white as chalk, her body quivered as though </p><p>a lash descended on the stroke of even </p><p>sinister word spoken over the ware by an </p><p>unknown voice.</p><p>“You were speaking a moment since to </p><p>Sir Dean Densham? Quite so. Oh, thanks, </p><p>I	heard everything I wanted to—I tapped</p><p>the wire at a very opportune moment. You </p><p>are anxious about your brother, eh? Again </p><p>The Seeds of Destruction </p><p>231 </p><p>quite sc. Your brother has been useful to </p><p>me bn the past two or three occasions—oh, </p><p>quite unintentionally I assure you—and </p><p>he was useful again to me to-night. But </p><p>to-night I’m afraid he was just a shade too </p><p>smart—for his own sake! However, that is </p><p>beside the mark and concerns only himself </p><p>and myself. What I rang you up for was </p><p>io	say that if you desire to meet your</p><p>brother on his return, be at Sir Dean Dens- </p><p>ham’s house in Whitehall at twelve mid- </p><p>night to-night! Understand? Twelve mid- </p><p>night. And you might also acquaint Sir </p><p>Dean Densham with the fact that I hope to </p><p>make his acquaintance very soon now—and </p><p>Mr. Algy Brett also. Can you remember </p><p>the names? It’s not really important—it </p><p>won’t do them any good to know it and </p><p>it won’t do me any harm. Good-by. So </p><p>sorry you were anxious about your brother: </p><p>Twelve midnight! ” </p><p> In a passion of hysteria, of dread, of ago-</p><p>nizing doubts, Eva still held the receiver to </p><p>her ears, begging, shrieking to the unknown </p><p>sinister voice to explain, to say that Car was </p><p>safe, to say that Car would be safe! </p><p> Until the Exchange called through to</p><p>ask what number she wanted she poured a </p><p>prayer of piteous entreaty into the inani- </p><p>mate mouthpiece, straining every nerve to </p><p>catch even the semblance of an answer. </p><p> But none came save the operator’s harsh</p><p>demand, and with a tortured cry of mental </p><p>anguish she ran blindly from the room to the </p><p>hall below, calling out as she ran for a serv- </p><p>ant to call a cab immediately. </p><p> Within a minute a taxi swept to the steps</p><p>and she sprang in, bribing the man with a </p><p>sovereign to drive his fastest to Sir Dean </p><p>Densham’s, to get her there in ten minutes! </p><p>To get her there in time! Bribing him </p><p>again to drive faster—faster- A mad- </p><p>ness in her brain made her scream to him </p><p>again and again to go faster! The clock in </p><p>St. James’ Palace pointed to twenty min- </p><p>utes past eleven and again she urged him to </p><p>drive faster. </p><p>SIR DEAN came to her imme- </p><p>diately, his face showing anxiety. </p><p>He listened without commenting </p><p>until she had finished. She told him every-</p><p>thing—of her fears and of the unknown </p><p>voice at the telephone. </p><p> “And you suspect foul pLy? You</p><p>think-?” </p><p> “I suspect anything. Sir Dean! I suspect</p><p>anything and everybody! That voice—that </p><p>awful voice! It was dreadful—every word </p><p>a menace!” </p><p> Eva Darien sat like a statue of despair in</p><p>the chair Sir Dean had placed for her. Her </p><p>fingers twisted and tore her gloves to shreds; </p><p>her eyes, black with fear, never left Sir </p><p>Dean’s face. </p><p> “It is barely half-past eleven,—we still</p><p>have thirty minutes in which to try to find </p><p>out what it means. I think perhaps some </p><p>one ought to be stationed in the porch in </p><p>case your brother does not return alone. </p><p>The odd thing is why Darien should come </p><p>here instead of to his own home. Why come </p><p>to my house at midnight—I mean, why has </p><p>the man who evidently knows his where- </p><p>abouts counseled him to come to me? If </p><p>the man who spoke to you on the telephone </p><p>is the man who is accountable for your </p><p>brother’s disappearance, then he is also </p><p>the man whose benefit it was to secure the </p><p>papers—and I can not think that he would </p><p>be so ready, so eager to permit Darien to </p><p>give his account of what has happened! </p><p>Only six hours have elapsed since the papers </p><p>left my charge—even the most daring crim- </p><p>inal does not deliberately send his scapegoat </p><p>back to tell his story so early in the game! </p><p>If you-” </p><p> “I think I saw Jacobs and another de-</p><p>tective in the hall as I came in? ” </p><p> Eva’s voice was jerky, but Densham</p><p>could see her mind working clearly and </p><p>quickly. behind the enveloping feverish </p><p>anxiety. </p><p>' “Yes, Jacobs and Martin. As a matter </p><p>of fact, Mr. Sterrith and Lord Vales are here </p><p>—about the missing papers, and the two men </p><p>are attending them. The Cabinet have </p><p>many enemies just now and- But I will </p><p>go down and give instructions to the men. </p><p>Will you wait here?” </p><p> “I would rather go with you, Sir Dean.</p><p>It is almost twelve—oh, let us go!” </p><p> Without a second’s delay the detectives</p><p>received their orders and acted on them, </p><p>stationing themselves within an alcove be- </p><p>tween the front door and the flight of steps </p><p>leading down to the street. The lights in </p><p>the hall were lowered and the massive doors </p><p>left imperceptibly ajar. Eva moved rest- </p><p>lessly in the shadows and Sir Dean never</p><p>left her side. The hall seemed full of whis- </p><p>pering shapes, barely visible in the dimness. </p><p>The Prime Minister and Lord Vales, im- </p><p>pelled by the sudden sense of something un- </p><p>232 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>toward afoot, stepped from the library and </p><p>stood listening, motionless beside the banks </p><p>of palms circling the stair-foot. </p><p> The sound of the traffic in Whitehall and</p><p>Parliament Street buzzed dully across the </p><p>dividing distance; the harsh hoot of a horn </p><p>echoed like a thunderbolt in the straining </p><p>ears of those who watched and waited, and </p><p>close on the heels of the discordant noise the </p><p>clock of St. Stephen’s boomed out majestic- </p><p>ally—One . . two.....eleven . . twelve1 </p><p> Twelve slow and ponderous notes—a life-</p><p>time of agony held between each reluctant </p><p>stroke. </p><p> TWELVE! Ere the resonant vibration</p><p>had died away a sudden commotion arose </p><p>beyond the door — a great cry ringing </p><p>through the night, a cry of horror and dis- </p><p>may, and then the sound of some one run- </p><p>ning on the asphalt pavement, some one </p><p>dashing up the steps to the door, taking </p><p>them three at a time, stumbling on the last. </p><p> THE double doors opened wide un-</p><p>h8h der the onslaught, and the two de- </p><p>tectives and a slim, slight, boyish- </p><p>looking man literally fell into the hall. </p><p>Breathless, panting, choking back inarticu- </p><p>late sobs, the newcomer came to a halt </p><p>opposite Sir Dean. It was Algy Brett, but </p><p>an Algy so white and shaken with horror of </p><p>something he had seen that his uncle could </p><p>scarcely recognize him. </p><p> “Algy!” he cried, starting out from the</p><p>shadowy wall and twisting the boy under </p><p>the light of the electrolier. “Algy, for </p><p>G-od’s sake—what? ” </p><p> Brett tried to control his palsied mouth,</p><p>but his lips slid from side to side and his </p><p>tongue refused to form the words. His </p><p>usually merry eyes were wild with the terror </p><p>of the thing he had just witnessed. His </p><p>fingers clawed his uncle as though dreading </p><p>he should leave him. </p><p> Then a voice, clear and strong, ringing</p><p>with despair, cut through the babble of </p><p>whispers and questions and there was an </p><p>insistence in it he obeyed. </p><p> “My brother! My brother! You have</p><p>seen my brother? ” </p><p> Brett spun round and met Eva’s eyes.</p><p> “My brother!” she whispered.</p><p> Also in a whisper Algy answered her, but</p><p>he laid his quivering fingers over hers as </p><p>they rested on his coat and conveyed a </p><p>sympathy his distorted words could not </p><p>summon. </p><p> “Yes, it’s your brother! Poor Darien—</p><p>out there at the foot of the steps in the road </p><p>—poor Darien! What a fate, poor lad! It </p><p>was awful! I was coming along in answer to </p><p>your message, Uncle Dean—didn’t get it </p><p>till twenty minutes ago—then just as I was </p><p>crossing the street I heard a funny noise </p><p>in the air above me—a swishing, slipping </p><p>noise, and stood still. It was- Oh, sir, </p><p>I wish I’d run away as hard as I could! If </p><p>I’d only run then! But I stayed, and the </p><p>next second something fell through the air </p><p>and smashed on the stones at my feet— </p><p>something heavy! I stooped down to look </p><p>at it—I thought it was a bundle. It was </p><p>poor Darien!” </p><p> “Dead!” whispered Eva.</p><p> “Stone dead—thank God, stone dead-</p><p>That devil!” </p><p> Sir Dean’s ears pricked suddenly. He</p><p>had caught Brett’s muttered ejaculation and </p><p>in a flash the whole black mystery of that </p><p>miserable night became clear to him. In an </p><p>instant he was once again the cool, calm </p><p>man of affairs and he flung curt orders at </p><p>the gaping servants; motioned the two </p><p>detectives and the men-servants who were </p><p>bringing in the secretary’s body on an im- </p><p>provised stretcher to take their burden into </p><p>the little waiting room to the left of the </p><p>hall; gave Eva Darien into the house- </p><p>keeper’s charge until she was calmer, and </p><p>then in a voice of such bitter acidity as made </p><p>them wonder, called his nephew, the Prime </p><p>Minister and Lord Vales into the study and </p><p>shut the door behind him. </p><p> “And now,” he said in a voice of thun-</p><p>derous anger, “ and now we will go through </p><p>the mill!” </p><p>II </p><p>EVA escaped at last from the house- </p><p>keeper’s attentions and protesta- </p><p>tions of sympathetic horror and </p><p>crept down the stairs till the sound of voices </p><p>guided her to the room where Sir Dean was </p><p>closeted with Sterrith and Lord Vales. </p><p> A fierce anger against Sir Dean was burn-</p><p>ing in her breast and she blamed him bitterly </p><p>for making so inexperienced a youth as Car- </p><p>lile the messenger for such an important </p><p>despatch. She felt a hatred for him as the </p><p>man to blame for Car’s death. The sound </p><p>of his voice, raised and slightly shrill, pene- </p><p>trating the door of his library, filled her with</p><p>an angry, grief-laden sense of wrong. She </p><p>The Seeds of Destruction </p><p>233 </p><p>turned, the handle noiselessly and stepped </p><p>within the room with some intention, vague </p><p>and undefined, of accusing him, of blaming </p><p>him. </p><p> An immense mahogany screen guarded</p><p>the room from the door and she stood still, </p><p>hidden by it, trying to choke down the </p><p>hysteric anger surging up in her throat. </p><p> And then, even as she stood hesitating, a</p><p>strange feeling came to her. It was as </p><p>though the room were charged and alive </p><p>with electricity—as though a mighty pulse </p><p>beat somewhere within those lofty, book- </p><p>(ined walls—a mighty pulse drowning the </p><p>throb of hers and of those pigmy men </p><p>seated at the distant table. She awoke </p><p>suddenly to the knowledge that not anxi- </p><p>ety or regret for her brother’s fate was the </p><p>vital factor—there was that other some- </p><p>thing, that unknown, tremendous quantity </p><p>which had been embodied in Sir Dean’s </p><p>voice when he called the Prime Minister and </p><p>the others into his room without even so </p><p>much as a glance at the shapeless bundle </p><p>that had been his private secretary a few </p><p>hours earlier! </p><p> It was a something which she had quite</p><p>failed to grasp—something which had driven </p><p>her to futile anger against Sir Dean. And </p><p>now it seemed to loom up out of the shad- </p><p>owy room and grip her soul. The papers! </p><p>It was their fate that mattered! It was their </p><p>fate menaced a nation! Their fate meant </p><p>the fate of an empire! The death of her </p><p>brother was only a little side issue—a pain </p><p>felt by only one person! </p><p> She stared at Sir Dean’s face. It was as</p><p>chough she had never seen him before—it </p><p>was the face of an old, old man. There </p><p>were four other men in the room, air seated </p><p>at the table facing Sir Dean—Sterrith, the </p><p>Prime Minister; Lord Vales of the Ad- </p><p>miralty; Brett, pale and distressed still, but </p><p>animated by a deep excitement that burned </p><p>like molten fire in his youthful eyes; Schles- </p><p>tnger, the famous detective for whom Sir </p><p>Dean must have sent immediately. </p><p> Sterrith and Vales were very pale and the</p><p>same anxiety that lined Sir Dean’s face was </p><p>becoming visible in theirs and deeper as </p><p>every moment passed. They were men in </p><p>the grip of a fear, indefinite in a measure and </p><p>yet so horribly real. They were men in the </p><p>grip of an evil, and the evil was very plain— </p><p>it was panic!—panic!—panic! Even Sir</p><p>Dean was inclined to be destroyed by it; its </p><p>influence had marked him unmistakably. </p><p> Schlesinger — a tall, narrow-shouldered</p><p>man with an emaciated, clever face and </p><p>sunken eyes overhung with thick brows— </p><p>was leaning over the table, his hands loosely </p><p>clasped before him, his all but invisible eyes </p><p>never straying from Sir Dean’s haggard face. </p><p>He was speaking in a soft, monotonous tone </p><p>that barely penetrated to the recess behind </p><p>the screen. </p><p> “The bald facts are, Sir Dean, that you</p><p>sent Mr. Darien, unaccompanied, to the </p><p>Foreign Office with the despatches because </p><p>you thought it would avert suspicion if there </p><p>should be suspicion, and because the other </p><p>and ordinary channels were, in your opinion, </p><p>being watched and were the most likely to </p><p>be attacked—if, as I say, an attack was </p><p>meditated. It has to be taken into account, </p><p>Sir Dean, that you, and you only, suggest </p><p>that your late secretary’s death is traceable </p><p>directly to his possession of the papers. Mr. </p><p>Sterrith here does not, I take it, believe-” </p><p> “But he must believe it!” interrupted</p><p>Algy Brett, his voice ringing through the </p><p>room with vibrating earnestness. “ You </p><p>must believe it! If you don’t, how are you </p><p>going to account for the papers? Where are </p><p>they? Not at the F. 0., not on poor Da- </p><p>rien’s body. You may take it from me, gen- </p><p>tlemen, that they are safe in the possession </p><p>of an old pal of ours! He it is who has </p><p>waved his magic wand over them! Our old </p><p>pal, Alsopp Ostermann, whom you, Mr. </p><p>Schlesinger, are invited to hunt down! </p><p> “You look supercilious, Mr. Sterrith, but,</p><p>if you will cast your mind back, you will </p><p>remember that you looked supercilious once </p><p>before over the prowess of Mr. Ostermann! </p><p>On the occasion—exactly a week since—of </p><p>the affair of the missing war-ships? You </p><p>scouted the idea that there was any inven- </p><p>tion under the sun that the impregnable </p><p>British fighting forces on land and sea did </p><p>not possess—except in the imagination of </p><p>the Daily Mail I </p><p> “ When Sir Dean suggested to you—when</p><p>he jolly well tried to poke it down your </p><p>throats—that this man Ostermann was the </p><p>owner and inventor of a marvelous air-ship, </p><p>you smiled and smiled, and Lord Vales here </p><p>smiled, and the whole Admiralty, and the </p><p>Minister for War was pointed to the miser- </p><p>ably few, miserably misunderstood aero- </p><p>planes which in flat, calm weather manage </p><p>to fly a few yards or so over Laffan’s Plain </p><p>and come to earth with a dashed sight</p><p>more ease than they rise from it! </p><p>234 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “To those amateur and speculative toys</p><p>you proudly pointed and boasted of them as </p><p>war-ships which would rout any enemy that </p><p>dared to invade our shores—always pro- </p><p>vided, I suppose, that they did not dare for </p><p>the next forty years or so till we were ready </p><p>for them!” </p><p>“AND in the meantime,” continued </p><p>Sir Dean, some of his old suavity </p><p>back in his voice as his nephew’s </p><p>thrilling voice awoke an answering throb in </p><p>his heart. ‘‘And in the meantime, Alsopp </p><p>Ostermann, a man working hand in hand </p><p>with a foreign Power for the downfall of </p><p>England, striving night and day to weaken </p><p>her defenses, is watching with the eyes of a </p><p>hawk for the moment when the opportunity </p><p>will arise to throw her at the mercy of the </p><p>enemy, her strength broken—by his means; </p><p>—her defenses crippled—by his means; her </p><p>coast unguarded and her army a panic- </p><p>stricken mob! </p><p> “ For the past month Ostermann has been</p><p>working for this—he and his masters across </p><p>the water! You, as Prime Minister of </p><p>England, Mr. Sterrith, should have known </p><p>this; you as the First Sea Lord, Lord Vales, </p><p>should have known it—twice I have told </p><p>you my suspicions and twice you refused to </p><p>be warned. Even now, now at this very </p><p>moment, with those despatches in his pos- </p><p>session, with the knowledge they contained </p><p>at his disposal, with the knowledge, gentle- </p><p>men, that we have fallen one over the other </p><p>and without a single protest into his trap— </p><p>hear me out if you please, gentlemen—with, </p><p>as I say, the knowledge that we have swal- </p><p>lowed the bait and that for at least twelve </p><p>hours almost the entire east coast is un- </p><p>protected, unprepared, you still refuse to </p><p>believe! You won’t take a warning, eh? </p><p>Yes, a trap, I say, a trap! And you fools </p><p>have insisted upon us walking into it!” </p><p> His voice rose almost to a shout. He</p><p>threw calmness to the winds—he threw </p><p>etiquette to the winds; he cared naught for </p><p>it. The sight of John Sterrith’s smug face </p><p>—startled now at his vehemence and twitch- </p><p>ing with nervousness—filled him with rage. </p><p>At all costs he must rouse them! At all </p><p>costs, or England—London—would be con- </p><p>quered withm a night by an enemy who per- </p><p>haps even now were steaming full speed </p><p>across the channel! </p><p> John Sterrith had risen to his feet. His</p><p>face was drawn and pallid and he looked </p><p>like a man with his back to the wall, sud- </p><p>denly awake to the reality that he must fight. </p><p> “A trap?” he asked thickly. “What</p><p>trap? ” </p><p> His stupid eyes stared into Densham's</p><p>snapping gray ones. “What trap?” he </p><p>repeated. </p><p> Densham minced no words. He was a</p><p>wild beast roused. He spat out the answer </p><p>like shrapnel: </p><p> “By whose orders were the Atlantic fleet</p><p>cruisers and the Nore torpedo-destroyer </p><p>flotilla sent to sea? By whose orders was </p><p>the Atlantic battleship squadron sent on a </p><p>wild goose chase to the Hebrides? By whose </p><p>orders was the east coast denuded of a </p><p>single man-of-war worth putting into action? </p><p>By whose orders I say? ” </p><p> Vales stiffened himself into a semblance of</p><p>dignified authority. </p><p> “The orders were sent through in code</p><p>from Admiral Lord Fredom—he conferred </p><p>with me on the advisability of preparing </p><p>for sudden attack and we arranged that </p><p>an imaginary enemy was trying to land </p><p>forces-” </p><p> “And as it happens you prophesied</p><p>rightly! They are trying to land forces' </p><p>Ostermann is a clever rogue!” </p><p>“Ostermann?” </p><p> “Ostermann. Codes can be stolen—or</p><p>perhaps you didn’t guess that? Who but </p><p>Ostermann sent those orders to the fleets? </p><p>Who but Ostermann spoke to me from the </p><p>Foreign Office and gained a clear five hours </p><p>by making me believe Darien had got the </p><p>despatches through safely?” </p><p> Sterrith ran his finger between his neck</p><p>and collar as though choking. </p><p> “My God!” he said breathlessly. “My</p><p>God!” </p><p> “The despatches,” continued Sir Dean,</p><p>his voice icy with ill-suppressed anger, “the </p><p>despatches were the germs of the terms of a </p><p>private treaty with—you know with whom, </p><p>gentlemen. A private treaty, which, seen </p><p>as it stands, is so hostile that even a weaker </p><p>country than Ostermann’s, a far more peace- </p><p>able one, would be justified in declaring war </p><p>upon us! To provide themselves with the </p><p>civilized orthodoxy of an excuse Ostermann </p><p>planned and succeeded in waylaying the </p><p>messenger who was taking them to Follett </p><p>for consideration. With those papers in </p><p>their possession no Power will blame them </p><p>for their attack when they publish the facts. </p><p>I	can not blame them myself. They have</p><p>The Seeds of Destruction	23 s</p><p>been waiting and waiting and preparing </p><p>for this opportunity, and it is childish to </p><p>quarrel with them for being clever enough </p><p>to foresee it and seize upon it! And in the </p><p>oackground—always in the background—is </p><p>Aisopp Ostermann!” </p><p> “But we ought to do something! What</p><p>can we do? ” Sterrith asked the question of </p><p>every one and any one. His nerves were on </p><p>fire and the thought that England would </p><p>hold him largely responsible crushed him. </p><p>“What can we do?” he insisted, appealing </p><p>to each one of them, little red shoots tinge- </p><p>•ng his pale, shifty eyes, his nervous fingers </p><p>playing with his high collar. </p><p> “There’s nothing to be done further than</p><p>I	have done—just yet. I have sent instruc-</p><p>tions broadcast. Every ship has received </p><p>orders. There is nothing to do but to sit </p><p>still and wait.” </p><p>A LITTLE silence fell upon the room </p><p>and each man was busy with his </p><p>thoughts. And in that silence, </p><p>noiselessly, like a phantom figure, Eva </p><p>Darien walked slowly up the room from </p><p>behind the screen. Not until she was with- </p><p>in the yellow circle of light thrown down </p><p>from the hanging lamp above the table did </p><p>any one speak, and then Algy Brett leaped </p><p>to his feet and crossed over to her. </p><p> “Miss Darien,” he said quickly, anxiety</p><p>In his voice as he looked into the ashen face. </p><p>“Surely you ought to have rested-” </p><p> She interrupted him with a little gesture.</p><p>And then, continuing her way across the </p><p>yellow patch, she walked up to Sir Dean. </p><p> “I think I have a message for you from</p><p>my brother,” she said simply. </p><p> Every man was standing and every man’s</p><p>eyes were on her face. She looked like a </p><p>woman in a trance, her deep eyes burning </p><p>blackly in the pale setting of her face, the </p><p>only sign of consciousness. </p><p> “A message-” Sir Dean’s voice was</p><p>aimost a whisper, and a wave of compassion </p><p>passed over his face as he looked down at </p><p>her. The thought flashed into his mind </p><p>that the sudden tragedy had upset her brain. </p><p>He tried to say something, but his tongue </p><p>:ormed only the words “A message?’- </p><p>She looked at him steadily. Not an </p><p>.-motion stirred from the frozen chill of her </p><p>iace—only those haunting eyes, blazing </p><p>with something which he could not read as </p><p>sorrow, met his and told of life. </p><p> “Yes. a message. Just now they per-</p><p> mitted me to see him. I kissed his hand—</p><p>they would not let me see his face—I kissed </p><p>his hand and as I pressed my lips to it it </p><p>opened slowly as though drawing my atten- </p><p>tion to that which lay within! I think it is </p><p>a message meant for you—I think it is!” </p><p> Her voice weakened; she took a step</p><p>nearer the table and laid upon it a paper— </p><p>crushed and creased and red in places. </p><p> Sir Dean picked it up and read it through.</p><p>Then read it through again and then again. </p><p> I am a prisoner in Aisopp Ostermann’s air-ship.</p><p>I can remember seeing him walk toward me as I </p><p>was halfway down the terrace, then nothing more. </p><p>I suppose they drugged me. I am supposed to be </p><p>still insensible, but I have been conscious for the </p><p>last hour. They have flung me into a lazarette </p><p>between two steel walls—such a narrow space that </p><p>makes it agony to breathe and a worse agony to write </p><p>this message, but I must try and let some one know. </p><p>The drug still fogs me, yet I can hear them talking </p><p>quite plainly and clearly in the cabin beyond the </p><p>inner wall of steel plates—the rivets of the plates are </p><p>sinking deeper and deeper every moment into my </p><p>flesh, so tightly am I wedged. </p><p> Whoever finds me, take this paper to Sir Dean</p><p>Densham in Whitehall. To him the following— </p><p>Break the news of my fate to my sister. Look in </p><p>the lower left drawer of your ebony desk and there </p><p>find the despatches and papers which by this time </p><p>you will believe to be stolen and in the hands of the </p><p>enemy. But I had observed strangers following me </p><p>the last day or so, and as a test I carried faked </p><p>despatches with me this afternoon. </p><p> Ostermann’s anger is maniac at the deception; I</p><p>can hear him raving and wrangling and shouting </p><p>orders. They are going to murder me—to throw </p><p>me overboard. It’s horrible, the helplessness of </p><p>waiting for them to comc for me! </p><p> They have wireless on board and the operator has</p><p>been working it for the last hour. Once I heard </p><p>Ostermann say “ Call up the fleet and tell them-” </p><p>the rest of it was lost. Then another order: “Strew </p><p>London with the Seeds of Destruction. Strew them </p><p>broadcast over England! Sow them on every ship </p><p>they possess! Seeds of Destruction! Seeds of </p><p>Death! A sower of the name of Ostermann! A </p><p>reaper of the name of Gray Ghost, who will sound the </p><p>last trump!" </p><p> He is laughing now—horrible laughter—and I can</p><p>hear him emptying bags on the table—bags of some- </p><p>thing that rattle and roll like quantities of bullets </p><p>and yet have the sound of stones being heaped </p><p>together. I’d give the world to be able to see </p><p>through this impenetrable steel, to warn you more </p><p>clearly! </p><p> I think they are coming for me now—the ship is</p><p>dropping and shooting to earth. Eva, my last </p><p>thought-</p><p> “He saved the papers, thank God! He</p><p>save.’’; the papers!” Sir Dean muttered and </p><p>passed the blood-stained page, torn from a </p><p>pocket-book, across the table to Schlesinger. </p><p>Schlesinger read it once and handed it </p><p>236 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>to Algy Brett, who was next to him, with </p><p>the brief comment, “Bombs, I suppose!” </p><p> Algy read the posthumous message with</p><p>his brain working rapidly and ever circling </p><p>round the one man—Ostermann. Oster- </p><p>mann had been balked of the papers he had </p><p>kidnapped Darien to get hold of. Oster- </p><p>mann had ordered the wholesale “sowing” </p><p>of “Seeds of Destruction” in revenge, be- </p><p>sides the brutal murder of Densham’s secre- </p><p>tary. What did he mean by “ Seeds of De- </p><p>struction?” Bombs? Schlesinger thought </p><p>so. Bombs! Could it be? Were his allies </p><p>from across the Channel already steaming </p><p>toward England with the pennant of war </p><p>flying in defiant triumph, or had the loss of </p><p>the despatches delayed them? Were the </p><p>“Seeds of Destruction” purely and solely a </p><p>holocaustic revenge on Ostermann’s part </p><p>and entirely independent of the threatened </p><p>invasion? Bombs? Bombs? But if they </p><p>were bombs something would have hap- </p><p>pened before this! London could have been </p><p>wrecked in the time which must have elapsed </p><p>between the writing of the blood-stained </p><p>little note and now. Now it was almost one </p><p>o’clock. An hour after that fatal midnight! </p><p>An hour since St. Stephen’s had boomed out </p><p>Carlile Darien’s death-signal! In an hour </p><p>something would have happened? And yet </p><p>that warning, written by a hand that was </p><p>barely cold in death! It was impossible to </p><p>disregard it! </p><p> And then, in a flash, light came to him.</p><p>It was as though a voice breathed in his ear </p><p>—the chill, wraith’s voice of the murdered </p><p>Darien! </p><p> He flung round in a frenzy of excitement,</p><p>the blood flaming in his face, his eyes </p><p>snapping. </p><p> “The late edition of the Westminster</p><p>Gazette?” he cried eagerly. “I saw Ed- </p><p>monds hand it to you, uncle.” </p><p> He searched among the papers on the</p><p>desk and found it. It was a midnight edi- </p><p>tion on the Parliamentary crisis. He </p><p>turned in awkward haste to the stop-press </p><p>news and read a short three-line sentence </p><p>out loud. </p><p> A van-driver was killed late this evening in Fleet</p><p>Street by a meteorite. It struck him with such</p><p>great force that it was found imbedded in his brain </p><p>on arrival at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital. </p><p> Brett flung the paper down before Schles-</p><p>inger. </p><p> “A meteorite?” he said, his voice shrill</p><p> with meaning. “A meteorite, or a ‘Seed of</p><p>Destruction ? ’ Which? ” </p><p>III </p><p>THE dawn found Algy Brett return- </p><p>ing from a laborious, systematic </p><p>search which had resulted in his </p><p>possessing three peculiarly round, peculiarly </p><p>similar, dead-white, lead-heavy stones. Oee </p><p>he had picked up in an area of the new War </p><p>Office buildings, one in the yard of 1st. </p><p>Paul’s Cathedral, and one he had been per- </p><p>mitted to secure from St. Bartholomew’s, </p><p>spotted red with its victim’s blood. </p><p>He took them straight to Schlesinger. </p><p>Schlesinger looked at them almost care- </p><p>lessly and tossed them on to a side table. </p><p> “ Bombs—deadly bombs! ’’lie said shortly.</p><p>“Bombs, but devilishly ingenious! That </p><p>little lot of three must alone have cost a </p><p>pretty big sum, and the. man who is 're- </p><p>sponsible for their being where you "found </p><p>them must either be a lunatic or an enemy </p><p>more than ordinarily vindictive and cruel?’ </p><p>Brett received the big detective’s verdict </p><p>without moving a muscle. That the eyilly </p><p>pallid things were bombs of some soft or </p><p>other he had guessed—it would be absolute </p><p>foolishness to attempt to think otherwise-r </p><p>and he also realized that, whatever their </p><p>ultimate purpose, at present they were </p><p>harmless. So he watched Schlesinger toss </p><p>them oh the side-table with the composure </p><p>of a war veteran. </p><p> “We guessed that at one o’clock this</p><p>morning!” he said coolly. “We only </p><p>wanted to authenticate Darien’s message </p><p>that they were sowing what they facetiously </p><p>called seeds/ What I now want to know is </p><p>what will send them off? That they are </p><p>intended to go off at a certain time is obvious </p><p>—but when! That’s the mighty question? </p><p>When? And another mighty question is, </p><p>How? It’s a certainty that Ostermann, </p><p>when he has finished ‘placing’ the beastly </p><p>things, isn’t going to spend some more time </p><p>hunting ’em up and setting ’em off! That </p><p>isn’t likely, is it? Especially if there’s a </p><p>daisy little fleet of men-of-war twiddling </p><p>their thumbs outside there waiting for Lon- </p><p>don to be blown to eternity so they can </p><p>then rush in and sing ‘We’re-King of the </p><p>Castle’ at long, long last?” </p><p> “I should say it was no^ at all likely, Mr.</p><p>Brett. The things will. .go ctff by them- </p><p>selves in due course.” </p><p>The Seeds of Destruction </p><p>2 37 </p><p> “And we can do nothing but sit still and</p><p>twiddle our thumbs till they do? ” </p><p> “We can do something, certainly—we</p><p>have done already a great deal. Sir Dean </p><p>has made the communication wires in every </p><p>inch of England red-hot with instructions; </p><p>secret agents have almost worn a path from </p><p>Whitehall to all the arsenals, barracks, </p><p>depots, telephone exchanges; the coasts are </p><p>alive with moving gun-barrels; the water is </p><p>black with scouting destroyers; every ship </p><p>is cleared for action! Sir Dean is a wonder- </p><p>ful old fellow. You ought to be proud of </p><p>being his nephew. According to him he’s </p><p>a little proud of you, eh? I heard of your </p><p>adventure of the stolen battleships and the </p><p>Liverpool affair. Good lad! I wish you </p><p>belonged_to me.” </p><p> “It would be exciting, wouldn’t it? But</p><p>tell me more. Tell me in what numbers do </p><p>you think they have sown these things? I </p><p>searched the War Office from ceiling to </p><p>cellar—we all did—and we found nothing </p><p>but that one white stone, and that was out- </p><p>side the building. Do you think they’d be </p><p>satisfied with one?” </p><p> “One would be more than sufficient to</p><p>make hay of Whitehall itself, let alone the </p><p>War Office! Staking everything to the unit </p><p>System, I think we have London anyway </p><p>almost freed from the menace. My men </p><p>have been busy. They have swarmed over </p><p>the face of the map like bees. And they’ve </p><p>collected a. most satisfactory amount of </p><p>honey!” </p><p> “Phew! That’s good news, isn’t it?”</p><p>exclaimed Algy, his face lighting up. </p><p> “Very good,” assented the detective,</p><p>smiling at the other’s enthusiasm. “But </p><p>it would be more satisfactory if we could </p><p>collect Ostermann. For two reasons I want </p><p>him!” </p><p> “It’s easier to put salt on a bird’s tail than</p><p>to try and catch Ostermann. What are the </p><p>two reasons? ” </p><p> “First, he may set to work any moment</p><p>the power which is to explode his ‘Seeds of </p><p>Destruction.’ Secondly, we do not know </p><p>that he has sown them all!” </p><p> “ If I could only discover the secret—the</p><p>unholy secret of those anemic pebbles! If </p><p>we knew that-” </p><p> “Evflfthen we would not be much better</p><p>off than we are now. It’s that man Oster-</p><p>mann, the njaster hand! Ostermann, who, </p><p>by a finger pressed upon a tiny button, can </p><p>gain the'power -.to slaughter us all!” </p><p> BRETT sprang up from his chair</p><p>ki/W anc* over Schlesinger, peering </p><p>into his clever, emaciated face with </p><p>eyes ablaze. </p><p> “You know? You’ve solved the riddle?</p><p>You know the secret of the bombs? Lord, </p><p>here have I been chewing my nails trying to </p><p>puzzle it out and you’ve known it all the </p><p>time! Tell me!” </p><p> The detective, famous in two continents,</p><p>known the world over, reverenced by his </p><p>satellites, consulted by every crowned head </p><p>in Europe, the Czar’s personal friend, stood </p><p>up suddenly before Algy Brett and bade </p><p>him look at him. </p><p> He was more than ordinarily tall, emaci-</p><p>ated to a point verging on a skeleton, with </p><p>narrow shoulders shrugged up to his ears, </p><p>a mass of stringy hair strikingly white and </p><p>lifeless, a pair of brilliant eyes deeply sunk. </p><p>Above them protruded a pair of bushy </p><p>brows whose inky blackness was almost </p><p>grotesque in harsh comparison with his </p><p>ashen hair and colorless face, seered and </p><p>lined and pitted as though a lingering, un- </p><p>conquerable disease devoured and fed it. </p><p> “Look at me!” he commanded. “In me</p><p>—in the wreck of a fine man you see—a </p><p>martyr to science! Years ago my name was </p><p>beginning to be whispered abroad as a </p><p>scientist. I intended to make it a name to </p><p>conjure with. Perhaps, after all, I have </p><p>succeeded in that aim, though not in the </p><p>career I loved best in the world. Perhaps </p><p>—who knows?—I have done better work </p><p>in this sphere than I might have done in </p><p>that other. But to continue. </p><p> “One of the mysteries I attacked day and</p><p>night was the mystery of why some oper- </p><p>ators of what is known as the X-rays should </p><p>have become attacked by a virulent, incur- </p><p>able disease—why its most persistent disci- </p><p>ples should, almost without exception, be </p><p>stricken by the deadly malady. I failed to </p><p>succeed. I fell a victim myself and was ill for </p><p>years—for so many years that my place was </p><p>filled; striplings had raced ahead of me; I </p><p>was a forgotten quantity. </p><p> “There was nothing for it but to turn my</p><p>attention to the profession I loved next after </p><p>science. I became what you know me to </p><p>be to-day, but I dabbled still, and one day, </p><p>not a great many since, I stumbled across </p><p>the secret which had baffled me so long, </p><p>which had baffled the whole company of</p><p>medical men for so long. I discovered the </p><p>poisonous fangl </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “I discovered one solitary, isolated, single</p><p>uy—a ray so deadly in its undreamed of </p><p>power, so malignant, so tremendous in its </p><p>consequences when vised alone that it will </p><p>raake the whole world sick with horrified </p><p>wonder and dismay when the knowledge is </p><p>given to it! A thin, pale purple ray—in </p><p>reality a flaming sword—the swiftest mes- </p><p>senger of death ever sent from heaven or </p><p>hell or from the cankered mind of him who </p><p>also has discovered it! He who has known </p><p>of it, improved on it, welded it to his colossal </p><p>purpose, sold it to his allies for thirty pieces </p><p>of silver! </p><p> “This is Ostermann’s secret! This is how</p><p>he will destroy England—how he hopes to </p><p>pave the way for that attacking army which </p><p>may even now be awaiting the signal to </p><p>empty its numbers into London and seize a </p><p>victory on the heels of panic! First he sows </p><p>the seeds, and as the sun in the heavens </p><p>shines down and brings to life the seeds we </p><p>sow, so Ostermann, flashing like a meteor </p><p>through the skies, will with his purple ray </p><p>shine on the seeds he has scattered broad- </p><p>cast upon the earth, and each of those </p><p>curiously shaped, curiously innocent-looking </p><p>little white stones there will burst forth </p><p>and shoot out tongues of fire! Ingenious, </p><p>isn’t it?” </p><p> Algy licked his lips. They were burning</p><p>and parched as though a fever gripped him. </p><p>Perhaps it did—the fever of an almost in- </p><p>sane and helpless anger against Aisopp </p><p>Ostermaiin. </p><p> “Ingenious!” he cried bitterly, his eyes</p><p>wet. “ Ingenious! The Man of Hell himself </p><p>couldn’t have invented anything more </p><p>monstrous—or used it worse! Ostermann! </p><p>We’re helpless! We’re in Ostermann’s </p><p>power!” </p><p> “We’ve done the one and only thing we</p><p>could have done without capturing the man </p><p>himself. Thanks to poor Darien we’ve been </p><p>able to do something!” </p><p>“YOU mean reaping his harvest? </p><p>Or at least reaping a patch or two </p><p>of it?” cried Brett with a cackle of </p><p>laughter shaking his voice. </p><p> “We’ve reaped most of it, I hope,” said</p><p>Schlesinger slowly. “Those bombs must </p><p>have taken days and days to fashion and </p><p>cost thousands of pounds each. It is not </p><p>likely on the face of it that our enemies—no </p><p>matter how rich and envious and ambitious</p><p>—would supply Ostermann with a larger </p><p>quantity than necessary. I am relying on </p><p>the theory that Ostermann does not allow </p><p>for any possible hitch occurring. He has </p><p>sown every ‘Seed of Destruction’ he had </p><p>aboard his air-ship and, for a space at least, </p><p>we are safe.” </p><p> “The toss-up is whether he has any emer-</p><p>gency store of them somewhere handy to </p><p>fall back on.” </p><p> “Not in England!” said Schlesinger</p><p>grimly. </p><p> “Why not?”</p><p> “The ray would explode the emergency</p><p>store at the same time it was blowing up the </p><p>others! I doubt whether he’d even risk </p><p>keeping one aboard his air-ship while he was </p><p>working the ray apparatus! Thanks to that </p><p>poor fellow Darien, I think we have him hip </p><p>and thigh over this little job, eh?’’ </p><p> Schlesinger clasped his thin fingers and</p><p>a flame of triumphal pride shot from his </p><p>hidden eyes. </p><p> “Thanks also to your wonderful'brain,</p><p>Schlesinger!” cried Algy, grasping the </p><p>folded hands and pressing them with boy- </p><p>ish gratitude and hero-worship. “If you </p><p>hadn’t figured what those beastly little </p><p>pebbles meant and had delayed sending out </p><p>every bobby in London—and every village </p><p>out of it where they possess a bobby—to </p><p>hunt all out, we’d have been preparing to </p><p>die at any moment! They ought to let you </p><p>loose in the Mint for this, with a couple of </p><p>sacks!” </p><p> “We’re not out of the wood yet, sonny! ”</p><p>said the detective, smiling. “We can not </p><p>be certain that we have even picked un </p><p>half-” </p><p> Even as he spoke the ground beneath</p><p>them quivered, a dull roar filled the little </p><p>room with thunder, a horrible, sickening </p><p>sound of tremendous explosion shook the </p><p>world, and for a long, long, unending cen- </p><p>tury that was but a minute of time it was as </p><p>though the universe had fallen and were </p><p>crashing about their ears. </p><p> Stunned and pale they clung to each</p><p>other—the man and the boy—fearful and </p><p>shaking. Then they dashed to the window </p><p>and tore the blind aside. </p><p> Peering out, they saw the eastern sky just</p><p>cutting a thread of opal-tinted pink, fore- </p><p>telling dawn. </p><p> Upon the river below, the wharfs were</p><p>tinging slowly with the reflection of the </p><p>thread, and beyond the river, hovering like </p><p>a fog-clogged cloud, shapeless and -distant,</p><p>The Seeds of Destruction </p><p>' 4 </p><p>239 </p><p>gray and menacing, something sailed rapidly </p><p>through the clearing air! </p><p> Algy leaned heavily against Schlesinger,</p><p>craning his neck round the dividing middle </p><p>frame of the narrow window. </p><p> He pointed to it, his breath catching as</p><p>though sobs choked him, his eyes flecked </p><p>with the funny little streaks of red which </p><p>had shot through them when he fled from </p><p>the secretary’s broken body as it lay at his </p><p>feet in the street. </p><p> ■ “Gray Ghost/” he whispered pointing.</p><p>‘'Gray Ghost!" </p><p> “And the Ray!” assented Schlesinger.</p><p> Yes, and the Ray! It was falling from the</p><p>air-ship like a stream of molten lead—thin, </p><p>purple in color, unwavering. At times it </p><p>also reflected the radiant rose color of the </p><p>coming dawn and became a flaming sword </p><p>—the sword of battle and murder and </p><p>death, tinged and streaked with crimson </p><p>blood! </p><p> And to meet it, as though welcoming its</p><p>coming, the earth shot into red and yellow </p><p>flames, licking the purple ray and staining </p><p>the dawn with smoke-grimed fingers. </p><p> “Woolwich Arsenal!” cried Schlesinger,</p><p>a bitter chagrin eating into his voice, “ Wool- </p><p>wich! Those fools!” </p><p> Ostermann had drawn first blood.</p><p>IV </p><p>AN HOUR passed—an hour of agony </p><p>and anxiety. London had poured </p><p>out into the streets — a jostling, </p><p>fighting swarm of terrified creatures who </p><p>had taken the terrific explosion of Woolwich </p><p>Arsenal to be the sign and signal that the </p><p>end of the world was approaching. They </p><p>marched down Whitehall, armies of them, </p><p>ragged and rich, singing hymns and offering </p><p>up delirious prayers to the heavens which </p><p>were red and menacing with the glare of </p><p>burning Woolwich. They massed together </p><p>in side streets, afraid to go back to their </p><p>homes, refusing to believe that all danger </p><p>was at an end. </p><p> And as though to determine them in their</p><p>obstinacy a second shock, though less vio- </p><p>lent than the first, shattered the stillness and </p><p>made the earth heave and rumble beneath </p><p>their flying feet! Once more the Ray had </p><p>done its work. This time it was farther </p><p>away—somewhere toward the mouth of the </p><p>river. And then, in quick succession, a </p><p>third explosion followed hard on the heels</p><p>of the second, and again the lurid glow </p><p>lighted'up the sky! </p><p> Schlesinger turned to Brett.</p><p> “Probably Gravesend—and Sheerness.</p><p>The last one was a considerable distance off. </p><p>Probably the unit system has failed to </p><p>work! Though I am thankful to say I did </p><p>not rely absolutely upon it, especially in </p><p>places of naval or military importance! But </p><p>all the same, even three is more than I </p><p>hoped he would get!” </p><p> Algy turned round from the window. In</p><p>the last hour he had not moved an inch </p><p>away from it. But at the last explosion the </p><p>mob had scurried away like frightened </p><p>rabbits and the street was almost clear </p><p>again. He pointed it out to the detective. </p><p> “It’s fairly clear now. Shall I run over</p><p>and see Uncle Dean? He asked me to slip </p><p>across as soon as I could with safety.” </p><p>“Yes, do. I’ll just get through to him </p><p>again and tell him you’re going. I will fol- </p><p>low you, perhaps, but at present I must </p><p>stay here and take the messages as the}' </p><p>come in.” </p><p>THE look of age had deepened on Sir </p><p>Dean’s face. It was the face of a </p><p>man who had lived a troubled cen- </p><p>tury in the hours that had gone. He turned </p><p>to his nephew with a flash of relief lighting </p><p>up the gloom of his eyes. </p><p> “Well, boy, any more news? I’m very</p><p>glad to have you here. I’m very lonely.” </p><p>“ Has Miss Darien gone? ” </p><p> “Yes. Vales took her home. Tell me</p><p>what Schlesinger thinks. Algy, it’s driving </p><p>me mad to realize that I must sit here and </p><p>wait, wait, while that fiend up there does </p><p>his evil work at will! Three victories for </p><p>him in London and four from the country! </p><p>Thank God, our ships are safe and are </p><p>searching the Channel—scouring the North </p><p>Sea for the enemy. Though I expect that, </p><p>as things have not turned out quite as they </p><p>planned, they have gone back to port to </p><p>await further advice from Ostermann.” </p><p>“Thanks to Schlesinger, this night’s work </p><p>must be as gall and wormwood in Oster- </p><p>mann’s mouth! And I’d give all I possess in </p><p>this world if we could only see him tasting </p><p>the bitterness of his failure!” </p><p> “ I would give the rest of my life itself to</p><p>be able to rid England of such an enemy! </p><p>If I could only do something! It’s this </p><p>awful state of helplessness that’s driving </p><p>me mad! If we could do something!” </p><p>240 </p><p>Adventure</p><p> “Still, the list isn’t a quarter as bad as it</p><p> ,r might have been, sir. Only seven. Wool-</p><p> wich, Shorncliffe, Aldershot, a Tyneside</p><p> yard, and unauthenticated reports from</p><p> Dover and Sheerness and Gravesend! A</p><p> severe bucketing, but nothing like it might</p><p> have been! Think of the carnage if Schles-</p><p> inger had not acted within five minutes of</p><p> leaving here!”</p><p> “A worse bucketing! Aye! And we</p><p> must swallow it without a murmur because</p><p> we can do nothing! We have no proof!</p><p> We have a man like John Sterrith at our</p><p> head—frightened, intent on keeping his</p><p> ministerial fingers clean, starving England</p><p> on his peace-at-all-costs policy! Peace,</p><p> forsooth, because he is afraid of the sound</p><p> of shots!”</p><p> “Well, he’s got some in advance and un-</p><p> asked for this time. Perhaps it will wake</p><p> him up. If he had only sanctioned that loan</p><p> to Hafner and myself we might have had the</p><p> nucleus of a fine fleet of aerial men-of-war</p><p> now and could have gone out on the stroke</p><p> of twelve and fought Ostermann on his</p><p> own level! Even if I could have managed</p><p> Star of the Sea I would have at least tried to</p><p> wing that monster bird of prey, but since</p><p> Hafner lias disappeared the engine has</p><p> broken down and 110 one seems able to</p><p> understand the stupid thing. If only</p><p> Hafner-”</p><p> “Hafner? What has become of him?</p><p> Disappeared? ”</p><p> “Yes, immediately we landed after the</p><p> stolen battleship affair. I had prophesied</p><p> that his share of the deal would be enough</p><p> to keep him for the rest of his life and that he</p><p> could at least enjoy himself building air-ship</p><p> models. I even suggested to him that the</p><p> Government might be able to see wisdom</p><p> in a year or so and that then his fortune</p><p> would be made. But he didn’t care for</p><p> anything I said. He seemed dazed.</p><p> “I think that the excitement of being so</p><p> close to his hated enemy, being, as it were,</p><p> .vithin an inch of victory and the consumma-</p><p> tion of his long-cherished revenge, and then</p><p> for Ostermann to escape him in the last</p><p> was too much for his brain. Anyway, he</p><p> escaped me and, though I have searched</p><p> everywhere for him, I can’t find him. 1</p><p> suppose he’ll turn up again some day.</p><p> “There’s one thing that makes me think</p><p> so and that is he gave me his word of honor</p><p> that if he possibly could he’d let me in at</p><p> the death! And if I know anything of</p><p>Hafner he’s the kind of beggar to glory in the</p><p>fact of there being witnesses to his final, </p><p>gloating triumph! Oh, Hafner will turn up </p><p>again, I’ve no doubt, but I wish he’d have </p><p>done it before this!” </p><p> The words were scarcely out of Brett’s</p><p>mouth when the telephone-bell rang sharply </p><p>at his elbow and, with a nod of assent from </p><p>Sir Dean, he took off the receiver and </p><p>listened. </p><p> A raucous voice, stifled and barely in-</p><p>telligible, came through, and at the sound </p><p>of it Algy’s face flushed up with sudden </p><p>excitement and he uttered a name for his </p><p>uncle’s benefit, motioning him to take up the </p><p>second receiver. </p><p> Hafner! It was Hafner’s voice! Hafner</p><p>trying passionately to control his words and </p><p>falling! They came tumbling and racing </p><p>through the telephone, tripping one another </p><p>up, stumbling one upon the other, some- </p><p>what incoherent, sometimes utterly incom- </p><p>prehensible, but always thrilling -with a fer- </p><p>vid excitement and a fierce, unholy joy. </p><p> “I’ve got him! I’ve got him! I have</p><p>watched all night and wondered what his </p><p>game was! Then when Woolwich Arsenal </p><p>blew up I knew! I watched him still, ’im </p><p>and ’is purple searchlight, watched him </p><p>circling and darting away up and out of </p><p>sight! Then coming back slowly down like </p><p>a bird, down, down, close as ’e dared to the </p><p>earth, as though searching for summat he </p><p>couldn’t find. Sometimes he’d go off for a </p><p>long time and then swoop back again an’ </p><p>search again with his purple light. An’ then </p><p>it ’appened. Something went wrong with </p><p>'Gray Ghost 7 I could hear her groaning as </p><p>she flew—it looked as though she was coming </p><p>straight in my direction, and flying low and </p><p>fisting badly and one of ’er wings drooping! </p><p>She’s maimed and broken for the first time </p><p>in ’er life—a bad break, and Ostermann is </p><p>in my power-” </p><p> The raucous voice died away in a wild sob</p><p>and Brett shouted wildly for him to go on— </p><p>to go on—that every minute was precious </p><p>—every second meant a chance for Oster- </p><p>mann! </p><p> “Where are you speaking from, Hafner?</p><p>Where are we to find you?” he yelled, for- </p><p>getting everything in his wild excitement. </p><p>“Where are you, and where is Ostermann?” </p><p> Hafner laughed like a madman at the</p><p>other end of the wire and they could hear </p><p>him gurgling, delirious with the frenzy of </p><p>his sudden opportunity. </p><p>The Seeds of Destruction </p><p>241</p><p> “Where are you?” demanded Algy for</p><p>the third time, a fierce impatience shaking </p><p>him. “If you won’t tell us we will have to </p><p>set the Yard on to find him, and the moment </p><p>we do that he will know! And he’s not the </p><p>man to sit still and wait for them to run him </p><p>down, is he? Look here, Hafner, if you </p><p>don’t work with us you’ll let him slip through </p><p>your fingers! Where are you?” </p><p> “In a call-office in Wapping. I’ve been</p><p>doin’ a bit of work down ’ere and livin’ in a </p><p>garret of a house. The garret has a door on </p><p>to the roof and I was up there when I caught </p><p>sight of Gray Ghost. Ostermann and Gray </p><p>Ghost disappeared somewhere on the river </p><p>banks. I’m going out now to find out where. </p><p>I’m goin’ to ’unt him down, and if I meet </p><p>him face to face-!” </p><p> “Tell me where you are! Give me your</p><p>address, you idiot, or tell me where I can </p><p>meet you! You can’t hunt that man down </p><p>alone! Wait for me to come along with you. </p><p>Will you? Why not? You promised me I </p><p>should be in at the end! I promise you I </p><p>won’t try and stop your taking your re- </p><p>venge—you can tear his heart out and jump </p><p>on it if you like—only let me be there, too! </p><p>Will you?” </p><p> They listened to him growling and</p><p>grumbling and grunting at the other end </p><p>and waited anxiously for the decision he </p><p>was struggling to. And then at last it </p><p>came — reluctant and ungracious, but a </p><p>consent. </p><p> “Well, yer can come when I’ve found ’im</p><p>—not before that, mind yer, though! 1* </p><p>won’t ’ave yer nosing around and giving ’im </p><p>the straight tip to clear out! And if yer </p><p>won’t try and tell me murder ain’t nice and </p><p>the sight not pretty enough to suit yer! Yer </p><p>can come if yer’ll promise me yer’ll wait till </p><p>I tell yer to come—oh, no fear of that, I’ll </p><p>give yer time and plenty! You go to yer </p><p>bed and sleep till I want yer—that’ll be </p><p>time enough for you. Aw, I’ll find him! </p><p>He can’t ’ave gone far. He was winged too </p><p>bad, he was! Now give me yer word you </p><p>won’t come hunting round with a lot of </p><p>’tects till I tell yer I’m ready. Thank yer. </p><p>I’ll ’old yer to that, mind!” </p><p> He rang off without a word of warning,</p><p>and Brett hung up his receiver with an air </p><p>of bitter disappointment. </p><p> “More delays!” he said pettishly, flinging</p><p>himself back in his chair. “I am sick of </p><p>them all! Hafner is an ungrateful turncoat. </p><p>I thought we’d got Ostermann at last! I </p><p>thought we’d got him at last!”</p><p> “And perhaps we have,” said Sir Dean</p><p>slowly. “ Perhaps we have. At least we are </p><p>sure of one thing—Gray Ghost is disabled and </p><p>out of the battle for a few hours, and with- </p><p>out Gray Ghost Ostermann is powerless! </p><p>For a few hours, then, we are safe. Al- </p><p>though we can do nothing, for a few hours </p><p>we are safe! Thank a merciful God—safe! </p><p>And now ring through and tell Schlesinger </p><p>I	command him to go to bed!”</p><p>DC </p><p>“ IF YOU, senor, had a seester you </p><p>love, an’ ever’ day her man she </p><p>j marry beat her—ever’ day he </p><p>-J beat her till the blood come, </p><p>what do you, senor?” </p><p> Mazaro Gonzales kicked the “Compiled</p><p>Laws of New Mexico” that held open the </p><p>door of the hot, dingy office, and crushed </p><p>a greasy sombrero with his dirty hands as he </p><p>doggedly waited for “Big Bill" King to </p><p>answer. </p><p> “Do you know what I’d do, Mazaro?”</p><p>Big Bill replied without a moment’s hesita- </p><p>tion. “I would take just about fifteen </p><p>minutes to give that brother-in-law a whirl- </p><p>wind finish, and I’d do it with about two- </p><p>bits’ worth of buckshot and the first piece </p><p>of ordnance I could lay my hands on! ” </p><p> “Me no comprendo,” grunted Mazaro,</p><p>knitting his bronzed brows and peering </p><p>through his pen-slit eyes at the big, hand- </p><p>some American who sat, tilted back in </p><p>a common kitchen chair, his feet crossed on </p><p>top of a weather-beaten desk. </p><p> “I mean, Mazaro,” and King stopped</p><p>puffing the big black cigar and faced the </p><p>Mexican, “that I’d shoot him dead full of </p><p>buckshot, and I’d do it quick!” </p><p> "Biieno, amigo,” was the “Greaser’s”</p><p>only comment as he shuffled out of the </p><p>door, and Big Bill King returned to the </p><p>business which Mazaro’s timid knock had </p><p>interrupted. The particular business in </p><p>hand and, in fact, about the only business </p><p>in which William Gordon King had engaged </p><p>since his arrival in Paradise six months pre- </p><p>viously. was cursing the stars that had </p><p>guided him to this forlorn town whose big- </p><p>gest attraction was its burying-ground and </p><p>whose chiefest enterprises were loafing in </p><p>the daytime and enlarging the cemetery </p><p>by night. </p><p> For, by one of the jokes of fate, William</p><p>Gordon King, the many-sided, was doing </p><p>time in Paradise, in the heart of the desert </p><p>country, with the office of County Attorney </p><p>serving as the shackle.</p><p> As a matter of history, it was no star at ai!</p><p>that guided him to Paradise, but the greasy </p><p>finger of Mazaro Gonzales, whose acquain- </p><p>tance he had made a year previous when </p><p>both were shifting railroad-ties on the new </p><p>line of road entering Paradise. Shifting </p><p>railroad-ties was not King’s regular profes- </p><p>sion; neither was county-attorneying. </p><p> His original intention and overwhelming</p><p>ambition when he journeyed West and </p><p>climbed the mountains was to gouge out the </p><p>heart of the Taos Range and become a great </p><p>copper king, but as months rolled by and </p><p>the only copper he found within reach was </p><p>the few pieces stamped with Indian heads </p><p>which he retained of his original capital, he </p><p>turned to the only paying profession he </p><p>could find, and it brought him side by side </p><p>with Mazaro on the new railroad grade. </p><p> When the season’s work was over and</p><p>Mazaro said, “ Go my town, Paradise,” he </p><p>accepted the suggestion, and before the end </p><p>of six months “Bill King” found himself </p><p>bearing up as best Fie could under the title of </p><p>County Attorney and sitting day after day </p><p>in his office in a o'ne-story adobe building </p><p>with an equipment of a half-dozen law books </p><p>242 </p><p>NECESSITY’S LAW </p><p>IN PARADISE </p><p>STELLA. BURKE MAY </p><p>Necessity’s Law in Paradise </p><p>243 </p><p>inherited from a suddenly deceased prede- </p><p>cessor. The law books, be it understood, </p><p>contained all the knowledge of law the office </p><p>' of County Attorney now held. It was not </p><p>necessary to know law to be elected County </p><p>Attorney in Paradise. </p><p> When the good citizens of Paradise had</p><p>first suggested the office to William Gordon </p><p>King, he hesitated for a moment, but only </p><p>for a moment. During that moment of </p><p>hesitation a vision of the railroad grade </p><p>arose before his eyes and the next he </p><p>was nominated for County Attorney. He </p><p>argued with himself that, granting he had </p><p>no knowledge of law, neither had he pos- </p><p>sessed any knowledge of mining or railroads, </p><p>and if in the few months he had been in their </p><p>midst, the inhabitants of Paradise had seen </p><p>in him the making of a legal light, far be </p><p>it from him to depreciate himself. The </p><p>previous occupations of miner and day- </p><p>laborer were unknown to his supporters in </p><p>Paradise, with the exception of Mazaro. </p><p>Mazaro kept his own counsel and Big Bill </p><p>did the same.</p><p> At the hour of Mazaro’s visit, Bill King</p><p>had occupied the office of County Attorney </p><p>for just two weeks, that is, he had held pos- </p><p>session of the office. There had been no </p><p>duties to perform, so it was not the obliga- </p><p>tions of office that caused him to curse his </p><p>stars. It was not the position of County </p><p>Attorney. It was not even Mazaro, who </p><p>had guided him thither. It was Paradise, </p><p>just Paradise—the most desolate spot in all </p><p>this barren country. And in this dreary </p><p>desert with its sacrilegious name, he had </p><p>sworn to stalk for one year as a mighty limb </p><p>of the law. </p><p>THE sound of the church-bell an- </p><p>nounced the Angelus hour and, </p><p>kicking his cigar-stubs into a cor- </p><p>ner, the County Attorney of Paradise </p><p>started home to his evening meal at the </p><p>ranch of Pedro Espejo. </p><p> There was small companionship between</p><p>ihe Easterner and Pedro, the ranch-owner, </p><p>or his wife, and “Senor” King ate his </p><p>supper and drank his vile, black coffee in </p><p>silence. </p><p> Paradise weighed heavily upon him to-</p><p>night and wrapped him in a gloom too dense </p><p>for the wreaths of smoke from his big black </p><p>cigar to penetrate. Not even the remem- </p><p>brance of Mazaro Gonzales’ visit or Ma- </p><p>zaro Gonzales’ family troubles could seep </p><p>through the pall of his own self-absorption, </p><p>until some remark of Espejo’s wife, spoken rf </p><p>in Spanish to her husband, in which she men- </p><p>tioned the name of Bonita, brought him out </p><p>of his pit of despair, for Bonita was the </p><p>name of Mazaro’s sister. </p><p> “I wonder if Francisco does beat up his</p><p>wife,” he mused. “Funny that Mazaro </p><p>should have made that call on me this after- </p><p>noon. Maybe he wanted the benefit of my </p><p>legal knowledge,” and he almost smiled. </p><p>“Maybe—Great Heavens!” and his breath </p><p>stopped as the seriousness of the situation </p><p>dawned upon him. Had Mazaro come to </p><p>him for legal advice? Was the story of the </p><p>brother-in-law, told in the brief words of </p><p>this Greaser, his ignorant way of consult- </p><p>ing an attorney? </p><p> An overwhelming terror seized Big Bill</p><p>King, who had never known fear in his life. </p><p>The more he thought, the greater grew his </p><p>fear. He had known Mazaro as a quiet, </p><p>peaceable fellow who lived alone in his Uttle </p><p>adobe shack and seldom spoke of himself or </p><p>his affairs. Once or twice he had spoken of </p><p>Bonita to Bill King when the day’s work </p><p>was over on the railroad grade, and always</p><p>in a bluntly tender way, but never until </p><p>to-day had he mentioned the fact of her </p><p>domestic infelicity. </p><p> So scant was the County Attorney’s</p><p>acquaintance with methods of jurispru- </p><p>dence that he had given freely of his advice </p><p>to Mazaro, never dreaming that anything </p><p>more than a hypothetical case was being </p><p>presented. He had spoken to a friend, not </p><p>a client. </p><p> As the evening wore on he became more</p><p>and more oppressed with the thought, and </p><p>finally determined to ease his conscience by </p><p>going to Mazaro’s ’dobe and talking the </p><p>matter over. </p><p> Once outside the ranchhouse, he felt bet-</p><p>ter and breathed deeply of the still night air. </p><p>However much the Greasers might be stick- </p><p>ing knives between one another’s fifth and </p><p>sixth ribs within their cabins, the night </p><p>without was quiet as the near-by graveyard, </p><p>and the only sound was the howl of the </p><p>lobos, or big wolves, that came from the dis- </p><p>tant hills. </p><p> King walked quickly along the white,</p><p>dusty road, watching the shifting patterns </p><p>traced on the path as the moonlight slanted </p><p>through the scattering mesquite. </p><p> As he neared the church he heard the</p><p>tolling of a bell and, rounding a corner, he </p><p>Adventure </p><p>heard a wailing, moaning sound. A coffin </p><p>was being borne by six bare-headed men. </p><p>Behind it trailed a dozen or more women, </p><p>each with a black shawl over her head and </p><p>each vying with the other in an effort to </p><p>make the loudest noise as they passed into </p><p>the church where the wail changed to the </p><p>most dismal chant imaginable. </p><p> In his present state of mind, this wailing</p><p>of women and the chanting of the funeral </p><p>service added tenfold to his already de- </p><p>pressed spirits as he quickened his steps </p><p>toward the home of Mazaro, across the </p><p>plaza. </p><p> Approaching the little wooden bridge,</p><p>across the arroyo, he heard the sound of </p><p>hoof-beats. Clackety-clack, clackety-clack— </p><p>nearer and nearer came the pounding of the </p><p>horse’s hoofs. </p><p> King stepped aside to give the rider the</p><p>right of way. As the horse dashed past, </p><p>Eig Bill King’s heart stood still, for as the </p><p>moonlight fell upon the rider, the legal light </p><p>or Paradise saw Francisco, the brother-in- </p><p>law of Mazaro, clinging to the broncho’s </p><p>reck with his left arm, while his right hung </p><p>iimp and lifeless, and blood streamed from</p><p>his face and head. King opened his mouth </p><p>to shout to the broncho to stop, but choked </p><p>:he cry in his throat when the sound of an- </p><p>other horse’s hoofs was borne to him across </p><p>ihe arroyo. A second time he stood aside, </p><p>:his time in abject terror, and as he crouched </p><p>down beside the chaparral he recognized </p><p>the form of the DeputyrSheriff in mad </p><p>haste, pursuing the pony which bore the </p><p>perhaps dead body of Bonita’s husband. </p><p> A thousand thoughts crowded into King’s</p><p>brain, but uppermost of all were thewords he </p><p>had said to Mazaro a few hours before: “I </p><p>would shoot him dead with buckshot!” </p><p> Imperfect as was his knowledge of law, he</p><p>icsew enough about procedure in Paradise </p><p>to hazard a bet that the Deputy-Sheriff </p><p>would arrest Mazaro without the formality </p><p>of a complaint. From what he gathered of </p><p>the conversation at Espejo’s ranch, the mat- </p><p>ter of Bonita’s family difficulties was a </p><p>known quantity! in Paradise; and Big Bill </p><p>knew that a little technicality like the </p><p>County Attorney’s signature on a warrant </p><p>for arrest would never bother a peace officer </p><p>in Paradise. </p><p> “Well,” he soliloquized, as he turned his</p><p>steps toward Pedro’s ranch, “I guess I’m in </p><p>for it, but I’d better keep out of the way </p><p>until the brick falls.” </p><p>BIG BILL slept little that night. </p><p>He had more on his conscience </p><p>than he had ever had in all his </p><p>life, and his conscience had borne some </p><p>burdens, too, for as he once remarked, “he </p><p>had committed about all the crimes in the </p><p>calendar, except suicide.’’ </p><p> There was something altogether discon-</p><p>certing in the thought that the first duty </p><p>performed in the capacity of County Attor- </p><p>ney was to advise a Greaser to murder his </p><p>brother-in-law, and the further thought that </p><p>the next duty would be to prosecute his </p><p>first client. </p><p> Of course Mazaro was arrested. It</p><p>didn’t take Deputy-Sheriff Hawkins long to </p><p>trace the criminal. Mazaro had admitted </p><p>and, in fact, had boasted in the Five Fingers </p><p>Saloon that afternoon that he intended to </p><p>shoot Francisco dead, but, from all he could </p><p>learn of the conversation, King could not </p><p>find that Mazaro had implicated the new </p><p>County Attorney in any way. </p><p> Before morning Deputy-Sheriff Hawkins</p><p>had rounded up Mazaro and had him locked </p><p>in one of the kennel-like cells that look out </p><p>upon the dirty courtyard called a jail in </p><p>Paradise.</p><p> Mazaro offered no resistance. With dog-</p><p>like silence he submitted to the law, never for </p><p>a moment making any attempt to vindicate </p><p>himself. What was going on behind those </p><p>dull, half-shut eyes, the County Attorney </p><p>could not guess. Moreover, there was </p><p>enough going on in the County Attorney’s </p><p>own mind to keep him pretty busy. </p><p> For, while Mazaro slept in his dirty cell,</p><p>there was little sleep for the County Attor- </p><p>ney. Day after day and night after night </p><p>he spent in his office in the quaint little </p><p>one-story building, poring over the few law </p><p>books the den afforded. “Money’s Digest ” </p><p>and the “New Mexico Reports” were </p><p>thumb-marked from beginning to end in </p><p>the hope of finding some authority justifying </p><p>such a crime as Mazaro’s. Instead of pros- </p><p>ecutor he became attorney for the defense </p><p>as he turned page after page, uttering mal- </p><p>edictions upon the heads of all his prede- </p><p>cessors who had left him so small a library. </p><p>Even the copy of “Compiled Laws of New </p><p>Mexico” was gathered up from the floor </p><p>where it had served as door-prop, but, like </p><p>the others, it failed to throw any light 011 </p><p>the question. </p><p> In desperation he dug an abandoned vol-</p><p>ume of “Chitty on Criminal Law” from </p><p>Necessity’s Law in Paradise </p><p>245 </p><p>a dusty drawer of fee desk and removed </p><p>from its supporting place under the back </p><p>ieg of the table “Bishop’s Criminal Pro- </p><p>cedure” and fell upon them with feverish </p><p>anxiety. After hours and hours of pawing </p><p>through “assault with felonious intent” to </p><p>11	premeditated murder,” he heaved a sigh</p><p>of relief as he came across “justifiable hom- </p><p>icide.” “Justifiable homicide,” he read, </p><p>“in an effort to prevent bodily harm to </p><p>parent, child, brother, sister-” There! </p><p>He had them! Sister—“in an effort to pre- </p><p>vent bodily harm to sister!” </p><p> For five seconds he breathed easier, but,</p><p>as he read on, came the fact of the premedi- </p><p>tation; the boasting of Mazaro in the Five </p><p>Fingers Saloon. As for Mazaro’s visit to </p><p>him, that was known to only the County </p><p>Attorney and Mazaro, and unless the </p><p>Greaser admitted it in testimony, the </p><p>County Attorney resolved that it should be </p><p>forever a buried secret. Nevertheless, the </p><p>fact remained that Mazaro had boasted </p><p>that he intended to kill Francisco, and no </p><p>amount of law reading could wipe out the </p><p>Jact that kept coming back to taunt Bill </p><p>King, that it was purely and simply a case</p><p>t..f premeditated murder. </p><p> “Well, by George!” he exclaimed, as</p><p>a new thought struck him. “Francisco </p><p>isn’t dead yet! Maybe he won’t die, so un- </p><p>less Mazaro treats me to a load of his buck- </p><p>shot or that sweet little brother-in-law gets </p><p>well and tries to beat me to death, I may </p><p>.;ome out all right yet.” </p><p> But before night a new phase was given</p><p>to King’s troubles, and one that made his </p><p>former anxiety fade to a mere mirage. In </p><p>searching through his legal books and pam- </p><p>phlets he learned something new. That </p><p>in just seven days the annual term of </p><p>court would be held in Paradise! In fulfill- </p><p>ment of his oath of office, he, the County </p><p>Attorney, must, on the opening day of </p><p>court, present to the Grand Jury all viola- </p><p>tions of the law within the jurisdiction of </p><p>his office. When he took the oath, this </p><p>meant nothing and the date made no im- </p><p>pression upon him. Now the awful mean- </p><p>ing of it stunned him. In seven days he </p><p>must prosecute Mazaro Gonzales for taking </p><p>his advice! </p><p> “I can’t do it, that’s all,” he repeated</p><p>again and again. “I can’t prosecute that </p><p>poor devil for doing what I told him to do. </p><p>And if I don’t, I’ll have to lay the case be- </p><p>fore the Grand Jury ; make a clean breast of </p><p>it; exonerate Mazaro, and then—then it’s </p><p>Big William once more to the railroad- </p><p>ties!” </p><p>ALL this while Mazaro was glorying </p><p>in his incarceration, hoping, pray- </p><p>ing that his shot had been fatal; </p><p>glad to stay in jail, willing to eat crusts, to </p><p>sleep on a dirty floor, to suffer anything if </p><p>only Francisco were dead and little Bonita </p><p>would smile up into his face as she did when </p><p>she used to bake his tortillas before the little </p><p>adobe cabin had seemed so lonely and </p><p>Bonita so sad. </p><p> For seven days Francisco lay unconscious</p><p>on the sheepskin on the floor of old Maria’s </p><p>hut where the Deputy-Sheriff had carried </p><p>him on the night of the crime. There were </p><p>no hospitals in Paradise. There was seldom </p><p>need for them. Usually the Mexicans did </p><p>their work so well that a priest and a grave- </p><p>digger performed the last rites without the </p><p>aid of a hospital. </p><p> But Mazaro had miscalculated some-</p><p>where and death was not instantaneous as </p><p>he had prayed it might be. If Mazaro had </p><p>but seen little Bonita hovering over her </p><p>liege lord during those hours of unconscious- </p><p>ness and delirium, and ministering to his</p><p>wants with her left hand while around her </p><p>right she wore a huge bandage covering the </p><p>marks of her husband’s last caress, he </p><p>would have bitten through the bars of his </p><p>cell and completed his work. But Mazaro </p><p>didn’t see. He only prayed in his cell. </p><p> At last the seven days had passed and the</p><p>day before the opening of court arrived, </p><p>with Big Bill King in a state of mind border- </p><p>ing on insanity. In all that god-forsaken </p><p>town there was no one ear into which he </p><p>could pour his tale of woe with any hope of </p><p>sympathy. He had determined on the only </p><p>course possible—to lay his story before the </p><p>Grand Jury and take his medicine. He had </p><p>reached the ultimate limit in his state of </p><p>anxiety and was waiting for the Grand Jury </p><p>to convene and know the worst. </p><p> Just out of curiosity, he thought, he would</p><p>make a call upon old Maria and inquire after </p><p>the ill-being of Francisco. Old Maria was </p><p>baking in the little bee-hivelike oven out- </p><p>side her house. </p><p> “How is Francisco to-day?” he asked of</p><p>her. </p><p> “He gon-a home; tak’ away from these</p><p>plaze, senor,” she replied indifferently. </p><p> “What!” he shouted in her ears, so loud</p><p>246 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>that she dropped the hot coals she was </p><p>raking. “He’s not dead?” and his voice </p><p>trembled with the burden of this last straw. </p><p> “No, no dead. Gon-a home with Bon-</p><p>ita.” And she adjusted the black shawl on </p><p>her head and turned to go in the low door, </p><p>but hesitated and added, as though un- </p><p>certain whether the information contained </p><p>news: “Mazaro, he gon-a, too, to hees </p><p>plaze,” and the door closed. </p><p> Here was new field for thought for the</p><p>County Attorney. The execution of the </p><p>law, it seemed, was being handled in Para- </p><p>dise unaided by the County Attorney.^ </p><p>Mazaro had been arrested without his sigr- </p><p>nature to the complaint, and had been re- </p><p>leased, likewise without his assistance. </p><p>Now that the fear of the Grand Jury no </p><p>longer stared him in the face, he was begin- </p><p>ning to feel annoyed that the County Attor- </p><p>ney was of so httle account in Paradise, </p><p>when he remembered that Deputy-Sheriff </p><p>Hawkins had told him once that in Paradise </p><p>they “never monkeyed with anything less </p><p>than murder.” “If they kills ’em,” Hawk- </p><p>ins had said, ‘‘all right. If they don’t kill </p><p>’em, we don’t have no time to bother with </p><p>trials.”</p><p> “Well, I guess my job’s good for the rest</p><p>of the year,” King assured himself. “That </p><p>is, it’s good unless Mazaro gets another two- </p><p>bits’ worth of buckshot and happens around </p><p>my way.” He had never uprooted the </p><p>lurking suspicion that Mazaro would hold </p><p>him responsible for his arrest. </p><p> But Mazaro didn’t trouble Big Bill</p><p>King’s slumbers that night and, for the </p><p>first time since the day Mazaro followed his </p><p>advice, King slept. </p><p>EARLY in the morning he was at </p><p>the office to prepare for the open- </p><p>ing of court. He had started dust- </p><p>ing his library and had reached “Chitty </p><p>on Criminal Law” when a timid knock was </p><p>heard at the door. </p><p> “Come in!” he shouted, at least he</p><p>started to shout, but the “in” died away in </p><p>a faint whisper as Mazaro Gonzales entered, </p><p>greasy sombrero in hand. </p><p> The County Attorney got ready to dodge</p><p>the buckshot, but found sufficient voice to </p><p>ask the Mexican to be seated. Mazaro </p><p>stood shyly just inside the doorway. In a </p><p>voice lowered to the most abject apology </p><p>and with his chin drawn in until it rested on </p><p>a dirty handkerchief tied around his neck, </p><p>he mumbled: </p><p> “Senor, Meester King,” he began, “are</p><p>you perfeckly disgust with me? ” </p><p> By this time the County Attorney’s voice</p><p>had left him completely. He looked blank- </p><p>ly at Mazaro and waited. </p><p> Bowing as though revealing an unpar-</p><p>donable sin to his father confessor, while </p><p>a great light dawned over Big Bill King, </p><p>Mazaro Gonzales gulped twice and said: </p><p>“Well, you see, senor—you see, 01’ Lars </p><p>he don’t keep no buckshot. You can’t kill </p><p>no man with birdshot!” </p><p>SIR JOHNTHAWKWOOD </p><p>A TALE or THE WHITS COMPANY IN ITALY </p><p>BY MARION POLK ANCELLOTTI </p><p>SYNOPSIS: Sir John Hawkwood, the famous English mercenary, at the time of this story in the service </p><p>of Della Scala, Prince of Verona, boldly refuses to kidnap the Prince’s ward and cousin, the Princess Giulia, </p><p>and allow the Prince to make a pretended rescue for the purpose of furthering his love-suit. Hawkwood </p><p>and his lieutenant, O’Meara (in love with the Princess’s friend, Francesca di Montalto), fear a treacherous </p><p>■revenge; Hawkwood overhears a plot of the Prince’s favorite, Della Torre, and his wife Violante, to undo </p><p>him by a false charge of treachery. He attempts to warn Giulia, but she repulses him with scorn for his </p><p>low birth and riotous life. He forcibly retains her scarf to wear as his colors in battle. Ashamed of his</p><p>past life and regardless of his own great danger, Sir John forestalls Potrero, the Prince’s henchman, and </p><p>himself carries off the Princess, her uncle Del Mayno, and Francesca to a deserted castle. Del Mayno is </p><p>released. Sir John plans to hold the castle against the Prince till aid comes from Florence enabling him </p><p>to send the Princess to her kinsman, the Duke of Padua. The Princess regards him as a mercenary cut- </p><p>throat and even attempts to stab him. </p><p>CHAPTER XVII </p><p>AN ATTACK FROM WITHIN </p><p>COULD make shift to hold the </p><p>place for as long as our scant </p><p>provisions lasted, unless Prince </p><p>Antonio came against me with a </p><p>large force and powerful cannon. And I </p><p>thought he would not do this until he had </p><p>wasted time in sending Gianni Potrero, or </p><p>another troop of the same sort—and every </p><p>tour gained was an aid to me, since in ten </p><p>days or thereabouts I might look for succor </p><p>from Florence. At intervals I made the </p><p>rounds of the castle to see that my men </p><p>were not nodding at their posts.I found </p><p>nothing of that sort, but it was plain that a </p><p>spirit of discord was stirring. When I came </p><p>on two men together, they were deep in some </p><p>conference which they broke off with an air </p><p>half sheepish and half sullen. The meaning </p><p>of all this was easy to guess. There had </p><p>been a deal of secret discussion as to why </p><p>the Prince’s cousin was our prisoner, and </p><p>some of my troop had come to the con- </p><p>24.7 </p><p>248 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>elusion that the business was not to their </p><p>liking. </p><p> Returning to the hall, I kicked the fire</p><p>and polished the hilt of my sword. A </p><p>mutiny! And if I fell, what would then be- </p><p>come of the Princess? I shuddered to think </p><p>what might chance if O’Meara and I were </p><p>cut down and the wild horde about us were </p><p>left free to do their own will. However, it </p><p>was useless to worry. I needed all my </p><p>strength and had better try to sleep. But </p><p>hardly had I closed my eyes when a new </p><p>thought sent me to my feet in a cold chill. </p><p>What if some among my men should try </p><p>tampering with the Princess’ door? In the </p><p>end I stretched myself at full length close to </p><p>her threshold on the stone paving. </p><p> In the morning I bade O’Meara take food</p><p>to the ladies, whom I had no intention of </p><p>seeking that day. It was quite useless, I </p><p>knew, to try to convince the Princess of my </p><p>good faith, and I had resolved to make no</p><p>further effort. </p><p> O’Meara did not return, and after finish-</p><p>ing my meal in solitude I began to experience </p><p>considerable curiosity as to what he could be </p><p>about. Yielding at last, I went quietly up </p><p>the stairs, and paused with my foot on the </p><p>topmost step, my mouth falling open in </p><p>astonishment. </p><p> Francesca and O’Meara had come out</p><p>into the gallery. I smiled. Since Giulia had </p><p>failed the night before in her attempt to </p><p>crush me with her anger and her cold steel, </p><p>no doubt her lady had determined to see if </p><p>she might not have better luck in winning </p><p>O’Meara over to their cause. </p><p> A wide stone bench was built into the</p><p>wall, and on this lay Madonna Francesca in </p><p>the most limp and pathetic heap imaginable, </p><p>her misty golden hair disheveled, her dark </p><p>eyes full of tears, her pretty lips quivering </p><p>in a fashion that might well have made any </p><p>living man long to kiss them into smiles. </p><p>The Irishman stood before her, and at sight </p><p>of him I came near to betraying my presence </p><p>with a roar of mirth. Never in my life </p><p>had I beheld such a picture of abject cow- </p><p>ardice as he now appeared before this little </p><p>golden-haired lady. </p><p> “Ah,” she sobbed, piteously enough. “I</p><p>can not believe it of you, Messer O’Meara, </p><p>indeed I can not! Only two days ago we </p><p>were in the Prince’s loggia, and you swore you </p><p>loved me with all your heart and soul-” </p><p> “And I did that same!” he protested</p><p>oassionately. </p><p> She turned away from him pettishly. '11</p><p>can never trust you again, I can never look </p><p>on you without fear and horror!” she in- </p><p>formed him relentiessly. “Do you think I </p><p>shall ever forget the ride you gave me yester- </p><p>day? I am stiff and sore and frightened yet </p><p>—and see how you bruised my finger against </p><p>your steel vest! It is blue at the tip, you </p><p>can see for yourself! ” And she extended a </p><p>little, white hand with an intensely tragic </p><p>gesture. </p><p> The utter horror that instantly depicted</p><p>itself on O’Meara’s face appeared to mollify </p><p>her slightly, and amused me to such a point </p><p>that I came near betraying my presence by </p><p>a burst of laughter. A bruised finger, </p><p>indeed! The Irishman was accustomed to </p><p>see blood run like water, and I had seen him </p><p>take wounds that were near mortal with </p><p>never a groan, yet his anguished solicitude </p><p>was as sincere as though he were some young </p><p>girl who had never looked on a bare blade. </p><p>I LEFT the two at their wrangling</p><p>and made the round of the castle, </p><p>—	finding nothing that heartened me</p><p>greatly. The dissatisfaction of the men had </p><p>grown in the night; presently there would be </p><p>an outbreak—and I found myself looking </p><p>forward to it with an uneasiness I had never </p><p>felt before in time of peril. I gave no sign, </p><p>but strode about briskly, praising some, </p><p>rating others, giving curt orders after my </p><p>usual fashion, but I knew that the instant </p><p>my gaze was off them they fell to grumbling </p><p>and plotting behind my back. The air had </p><p>the still tenseness of a coming storm. And </p><p>if my own troopers turned against me, how </p><p>was I to hold the castle against Antonio? </p><p> Weary and disheartened, I went up on the</p><p>battlements, gazing across the black woods </p><p>and the fertile country that melted away in </p><p>the distance. How soon might I hope to </p><p>see the Florentine troop come across that </p><p>stretch of land to help me in my need? And </p><p>what if, for reasons of policy, they should </p><p>forget my old services and fail me? I de- </p><p>cided that it was best not to consider this </p><p>possibility. Come what might, having gone </p><p>thus far I must go farther, and save the </p><p>Princess. </p><p> I had been reflecting in melancholy soli-</p><p>tude for perhaps an hour when hurrying </p><p>footsteps sounded near me and Pierre came </p><p>rushing into sight. “Sir John, Sir John!” </p><p>he cried eagerly. “ Come below, I beg you! </p><p>Messer O’Meara has sent me to summon you. </p><p>Sir John Hawkwood </p><p>249 </p><p>It is the men—curse them, they have gone </p><p>mad! They say you have betrayed them </p><p>and turned the Prince against them. Last </p><p>night they saw the jewels the Princess wore, </p><p>and now they swear to seize them and </p><p>scatter over Italy to seek fortune where </p><p>they may. But first they will kill you and </p><p>Messer O’Meara, and as for the women-” </p><p> I darted down the stairs with him at my</p><p>heels. There was a ringing in my ears, a </p><p>quick darkness before my eyes. I was well </p><p>used to danger and looked for no other fate </p><p>than to die some day by the sword; nor was </p><p>my life so noble a thing that I would have </p><p>grieved greatly over the losing of it. But </p><p>the Princess! Had I brought her here that </p><p>she might fall into the hands of men like my </p><p>mercenaries? Better a thousand times that </p><p>I had left her to Antonio della Scala! The </p><p>thought lent wings to my feet as I hurried </p><p>down into the castle. </p><p> The murmur of voices told me that the</p><p>men were gathered in the gallery. As I</p><p>drew nearer I caught the angry note in their </p><p>tones, the accent of unbridled lawlessness </p><p>that spelt terrible danger. For a moment </p><p>I paused on the stairs, knowing better than </p><p>to burst in upon theni with any appearance </p><p>of haste and fright; and in that moment </p><p>my anxiety seemed to pass away, leaving </p><p>me confident of my power to rule the </p><p>storm. </p><p> A great crash fell on my ears, followed by</p><p>a hoarse, evil shout of triumph. Delaying </p><p>no longer, I left the stairs and strode into </p><p>the gallery. </p><p> The crash had been caused by the break-</p><p>ing in of the Princess’ door, which had flown </p><p>into splinters. The men were surging for- </p><p>ward now, then giving back slightly, for in </p><p>the opening stood O’Meara, his face white </p><p>with anger, his eyes blazing, and his drawn </p><p>sword flashing in his hand. Behind him </p><p>stood Madonna Giulia. She was very pale </p><p>and had a look of restrained horror, but held </p><p>herself proudly erect and made no sign of </p><p>^ear. Francesca was clinging to her in </p><p>terror, trembling and hiding her face. </p><p> “God curse ye all for a set of cowardly</p><p>devils!” O’Meara was crying fiercely. </p><p>“Come on, then—come on, and taste cold </p><p>-teel! Never fear, Princess—and you, </p><p>.-navourneen, keep up heart,” he encouraged </p><p>'he ladies, across his shoulder. “’Tis Sir </p><p>j,’ohn will be after settling the knaves in the </p><p>wink of an eye when he comes.” He gave a </p><p>-ar-whoop of delight at seeing me. “All’s </p><p>well now, " he went on to the ladies, with an </p><p>easy assurance most flattering to my powers. </p><p>“Make yourselves easy, and never trouble </p><p>to look any more at these dogs!” j </p><p>I strode across the gallery, straight </p><p>through the crowd, which parted instinct- </p><p>ively to give me room. I had reached </p><p>O’Meara and the doorway before one of the </p><p>men shrieked out, bidding the others cut me </p><p>off and end me with a dagger-thrust. Again </p><p>they surged forward, and I looked on a </p><p>circle of fierce, evil faces full of the dangerous </p><p>passions of the wild beast. All were armed. </p><p>I caught the flash of many a ragged-Iooking </p><p>knife and many a keen cutlass. Instinctive- </p><p>ly I turned my head for a glance at the </p><p>Princess. Her eyes had the look of one who </p><p>gazed on a vision of hell, nor did they change </p><p>as they rested on me. To her I was but of </p><p>the rest, as evil as they, as brutal. And I </p><p>have no doubt I appeared so in that instant, </p><p>for I had learned long ago that the only </p><p>fashion in which one might rule a band of </p><p>wild ruffians like my free lances was by</p><p>playing the part of a wilder ruffian than the </p><p>greatest among them; and I confronted </p><p>them now with a look fierce and grim </p><p>enough to put their swagger to shame. </p><p>CHAPTER XVIII </p><p>ONE AGAINST MANY </p><p> WELL!” I said sternly. “And what</p><p>does this mean, I should be glad to </p><p>hear? I commanded that this gallery should </p><p>be kept empty; I come down to find my en- </p><p>tire force assembled in it, and a door broken </p><p>to bits! Who is to blame, then? Who has led </p><p>you? Faith, I would not choose to stand in </p><p>his boots, for by my knightly spurs I will </p><p>have him beaten to a jelly for this day’s </p><p>work! Answer me, you dogs—what does </p><p>this thing mean?” </p><p> They kept silence for a moment—so</p><p>strong is the habit of obedience that my un- </p><p>moved front made them quail. Had I </p><p>hesitated ever so little, then they would </p><p>surely have struck me down, and the Prin- </p><p>cess’ fate would have been irrevocably </p><p>sealed. Since I confronted them threaten- </p><p>ingly, they looked half shame-faced, and no </p><p>one seemed anxious to make the first move </p><p>against the door. </p><p> “Well, am I to stand here forever staring</p><p>at you?” I demanded, and backed the </p><p>question with such a volley of camp oaths </p><p>250 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>as no doubt offended the Princess more than </p><p>the sight of steel. “Have you lost your </p><p>longues? You have lost your courage, at </p><p>least, I see! And you have good cause to </p><p>lose it, for you shall all pay for this! What, </p><p>is there no one of you that dares stand for- </p><p>ward and face me? Rally up your spirits, </p><p>and a spokesman who will dare tell me what </p><p>all this may mean!” </p><p> There was a growl of threatening anger,</p><p>and, encouraged by the sound, the leader </p><p>ventured to step forward. It was Jacques, </p><p>as I had guessed from the beginning. I had </p><p>kept him down with a strong hand and he </p><p>had many a grudge against me to pay off. </p><p>Knowing him as I did, I felt anew the danger </p><p>of the moment. If I failed, if Madonna </p><p>Giula fell into this man’s hands- </p><p> “So, it is you!” I cried contemptuously,</p><p>as he came a pace forward. “A pity they </p><p>could get no better leader! Let me tell you, </p><p>my friend, an hour from now there will not </p><p>be an inch of skin left on your back, so </p><p>flaunt your time while you may, and act the </p><p>hero! Go on—have you no tongue, after </p><p>all?”</p><p> For a moment he quailed, then laughed</p><p>maliciously. “My back is safe enough, mon </p><p>capitaine” he mocked. “In an hour—in a </p><p>half-hour—nay, in half of that—you will be </p><p>dead! We have had enough of you—we are </p><p>finished with the White Company! When </p><p>you are gone we will go back to France and </p><p>take service there. Say a prayer, Sir John, </p><p>if you have not forgotten.the art. We will </p><p>give you a moment to save your soul! ” The </p><p>others, surging forward ominously, laughed </p><p>in an evil fashion at the jest. </p><p> “I am not dead yet,” I said coolly, “nor</p><p>do I think that such rogues as you can ever </p><p>kill me. But come, you make me curious. </p><p>Why is it that you are all so angered </p><p>against me?” And I began to rock on </p><p>my heels, laughing as at the best joke in </p><p>the world. </p><p> “Because you are a traitor to us, mon</p><p>capitaine!" the ruffian answered, showing </p><p>his teeth in a snarling smile. “ You turned </p><p>against Prince Antonio, giving us no warn- </p><p>ing of it, and embarked in this scheme against </p><p>his cousin. Now our lives are not worth a </p><p>pin here in Verona. You have put all our </p><p>heads into a noose, but it is only your neck </p><p>that will be wrung! What do you say to </p><p>that, Sir John Hawkwood?” He had come </p><p>quite close to me, and was sneering mali- </p><p>ciously into my face. </p><p> THE situation was desperate and I</p><p>took the only possible course, one </p><p>which might, I knew, bring ruin 011 </p><p>us, or might perhaps save us—there was no </p><p>guessing which. “What do I say?” I re- </p><p>torted. “ I say that you need a lesson in the </p><p>proper fashion of address to use to your </p><p>captain, and that I shall give it to you!” </p><p>And I caught him by the back of the neck </p><p>and began to beat him lustily with the flat </p><p>of my sword. </p><p> At his cry of rage and pain I was quite</p><p>sure that his comrades would sweep forward </p><p>and annihilate me; but they did nothing of </p><p>the sort. Jacques was not too well loved </p><p>among them, though he had a large follow- </p><p>ing in his rebellion, and I have small doubt </p><p>it was the general sentiment that one so </p><p>boastful as he should be able to defend </p><p>himself. Since he was apparently capable </p><p>of doing nothing more than struggle help- </p><p>lessly in my grasp and yell to them for </p><p>succor, they at once experienced a feeling </p><p>of contempt for him, and an added respect </p><p>for me. For the moment, at least, my bold </p><p>move had succeeded. </p><p> “Have you more to say, you dog?” 1</p><p>asked grimly, as I belabored him. “Then </p><p>let us hear it, by all means! Are you turned </p><p>coward already? Another time you will </p><p>mind your manners with me,__I think!” </p><p>And I added another string of oaths for the </p><p>benefit of my hearers, who thought no speech </p><p>emphatic which was not so garnished. </p><p>“Well, is your lesson learned, or Will you </p><p>have more? Ah, would you then, knave?’ </p><p> He had made a desperate clutch at his</p><p>dagger and got it out of its sheath; seeing </p><p>which, and none too soon, I struck him full </p><p>across the side of the head with the hilt of </p><p>my sword, and he fell like a log at my feet, </p><p>in a dead swoon. I kicked the body out of </p><p>my way. </p><p> “Well,” I said coolly, turning to confront</p><p>the others, “and who comes next to ques- </p><p>tion me?’’ </p><p> No one answered. Had they rushed me</p><p>where I stood, as I had looked for them to </p><p>do, nothing on earth could have saved me. </p><p>O’Meara and I stood alone, two against two- </p><p>score. But as I looked about the circle, a </p><p>feeling of triumph ran through my veins </p><p>like wine. </p><p> There were men at the rear of the crowd</p><p>who had taken no part in the tumult, who </p><p>had merely waited to see how the tide would </p><p>turn. These, I knew, were not unfriend]) </p><p>Sir John Hawkwood </p><p>to me. Others were well enough disposed </p><p>save for a natural anger at the thought that </p><p>I had led them into danger of the Prince’s </p><p>vengeance for some purpose of my own. </p><p> There was a movement in the crowd, and</p><p>Pierre came through and faced me. “I </p><p>hope, Sir John, you’ll not use me as you did </p><p>Jacques,” he said, kicking contemptuously </p><p>at the fallen man and grinning broadly, “ but </p><p>I’d like to ask you a question of my own. </p><p>You’ve led us for years now, and if in some </p><p>ways you’ve been a hard master, you’ve </p><p>been a just one, too. You’ve played us fair, </p><p>and never tricked us. I believe the same of </p><p>ycfu now. We can’t tell why you have the </p><p>Prince’s cousin here a prisoner, but I’ll </p><p>never believe you are leading us into dan- </p><p>ger without good reason. Just tell me as </p><p>much, .and say that you mean to play us </p><p>fair, and I’ll stand for you against any odds </p><p>that come!” </p><p>TEE time for close-mouthed de- </p><p>fiance had passed. I must quiet </p><p>these fellows with some plausible </p><p>explanation of my strange actions. To be </p><p>sure, it would not be wholly true, and it is </p><p>the bounden duty of all knights to scorn</p><p>false statements. As a common thing I was </p><p>as truthful as any other man, but in the </p><p>present situation, with the lives of us all </p><p>hanging on tfie fall of the dice, I admit with- </p><p>out shame that I would have sworn away </p><p>my soul if I could thereby have added one </p><p>Iota to the Princess’ safety. </p><p> “Why, you fools,” I began, with an</p><p>appearance of bluff heartiness, “I am lead- </p><p>ing you into no danger at all, though I will </p><p>admit the enterprise is a trifle difficult. </p><p>Since you have come to your senses and </p><p>ceased to threaten me, I am willing enough </p><p>to tell you the meaning of it all. A short </p><p>time since I overheard Prince Antonio con- </p><p>ferring with Della Torre, and learned that </p><p>ae was weary of my services and had it in </p><p>mind to turn me off. That was a poor </p><p>prospect both for me and for you, eh? So </p><p>1 looked about for a way to better it. Well, </p><p>I knew that this lady was kin to the Duke </p><p>of Padua, who claims her as his ward and </p><p>has long tried to get possession of her; and </p><p>I fancied he might be willing to give a rich </p><p>reward to those who put her in his hands. </p><p>I held secret communication with him, and </p><p>arranged the terms—then I carried off the </p><p>iady. We are to hold her safe here until the </p><p>Duke sends a strong escort to bring us </p><p>safely into Padua, where we will be well </p><p>treated, I can promise you. Come, is not </p><p>this better than waiting in Verona until </p><p>Prince Antonio is pleased to turn us adrift? </p><p>And have I not a shrewder head than this </p><p>fellow Jacques, who would have persuaded </p><p>you that I had some trick in mind? [Our </p><p>reward will pay us well for all our trouble. </p><p>Are you content?” </p><p> I heard the Princess give a low gasp be-</p><p>hind me, but for the moment I paid her no </p><p>heed at all. I was looking with desperate </p><p>eagerness at the troopers to see if they ac- </p><p>cepted what I had said. If they did, all was </p><p>well. Fired by the hope of gain, they </p><p>would defend the castle like madmen, and </p><p>we would be safe until the Florentine men </p><p>came to my aid. After that, I cared very </p><p>little how soon they knew I had tricked </p><p>them in my tale. After conferring for a </p><p>time they began to give back sheepishly, </p><p>some of them cursing Antonio for his plan to </p><p>throw us over and congratulating them- </p><p>selves on the rare revenge of robbing him of </p><p>his cousin; others guessing how much Fran- </p><p>cesco Carrara would give for so great a </p><p>sendee. Presently, too, they began to cast </p><p>furtive glances at me, as if uncertain how J </p><p>might be inclined to visit my anger at their</p><p>unruliness upon them. “ Oh, we were fools </p><p>to doubt you, Sir John! You have a better </p><p>head than any of us,” one of the ring-leaders </p><p>muttered apologetically. </p><p> “You will be fools if you do it twice, for</p><p>I shall not be so patient again!” I answered </p><p>grimly. “Take yourselves off while I stay </p><p>in a good-natured mood!" </p><p> They obeyed me with cheers and glances</p><p>of admiration, and in a moment the gal- </p><p>lery was empty. </p><p>CHAPTER XIX </p><p>THE COMING OF VIOLANTE </p><p>WHEN the last man had clattered down </p><p>the stairs I swung about on my heel </p><p>and faced the three who had stood behind </p><p>me throughout the episode. O’Meara had </p><p>appeared to enjoy himself a great deal more </p><p>than the circumstances warranted. On my </p><p>coming, all feeling of responsibility and </p><p>anxiety had seemed to leave him, and he </p><p>had leaned calmly on the wall, watching my </p><p>struggles with a merry glint in his blue eyes, </p><p>and laughing heartily when I pommeled </p><p>Jacques into submission. Now that all was </p><p>252 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>over he sheathed his sword, then flung his </p><p>arms about me and favored me with a </p><p>bear’s embrace which came near making </p><p>ray ribs crack. </p><p> “ Glory be, ’twas yourself settled them in</p><p>no time! But the affair was a close one, do </p><p>you know that? May we never be nearer </p><p>dying till our last day comes! Faith, at one </p><p>time I was mortal afraid they’d kill you </p><p>first,” he rattled on. </p><p> “ Oh, hold your tongue, Michael!” I said</p><p>curtly, turning to the ladies. Francesca was </p><p>on her knees with her face in her hands. </p><p>The Princess was standing proudly erect, </p><p>her pale face turned toward me, and breath- </p><p>ing such indignant contempt as I shall </p><p>never forget. </p><p> “ So now at last I have learned the truth,</p><p>Sir John Hawkwood!” she said in a low </p><p>voice that trembled curiously with emotion. </p><p>“You have taken a bribe from the Duke of </p><p>Padua to seize me and bring me to him! </p><p>Now I understand!” </p><p> For an instant I did not answer her.</p><p>Perhaps I had cherished some vague hope </p><p>that the manner in which I had saved her </p><p>from imminent death might a little soften </p><p>her toward me—might perhaps even lead </p><p>her to say a proud word of thanks. The </p><p>scorn and anger in her face hurt me sharply. </p><p> She continued to look at me with a search-</p><p>ing disdain. “Listen, sir,” she said pres- </p><p>ently, in the tone which she might have used </p><p>to a dog. “You care only for money. </p><p>Honor, knightliness, chivalry—all these are </p><p>nothing to you. Good—I will make you an </p><p>offer. Tell me what Francesco Carrara has </p><p>promised you for this pretty business, and I </p><p>will give you double the sum to set me free.” </p><p>I bowed low to her. “Thank you, ma- </p><p>donna,” I said, with a bitter laugh. “Re- </p><p>member that even a man as vile as I may </p><p>not care to betray the master whose enter- </p><p>prise he has undertaken. I believe that even </p><p>my enemies do not deny me this one virtue.” </p><p>HER face twisted suddenly. “ How </p><p>can it be, how can it be!” she cried, </p><p>turning away from me passionately. </p><p>“Is there no good in you, that you treat a </p><p>helpless girl so for your own gain? Have </p><p>you no shred of knightliness, you that wear </p><p>aknight’s spurs?” She confronted me again, </p><p>and this time her eyes were kinder. “ When </p><p>you stood between me and that crowd of </p><p>cut-throats, Sir John Hawkwood, my heart </p><p>softened to you. I thought at least he is a </p><p>brave man, at least he does not fear to risk </p><p>his life. And a moment later I heard from </p><p>your own Kps for what base motive you had </p><p>brought me here! It is too much; I can not </p><p>believe that any man can fall so low!” </p><p>“Madonna Giulia,” I cried, “listen to me! </p><p>What I told the men was but a tale of my </p><p>own inventing, a means to pacify them and </p><p>turn them off. Do you not-” </p><p> Her face hardened again. “I do not</p><p>believe you!” she flung at me. “By your </p><p>own confession you have lied either to me ©r </p><p>to your troopers, and I have no trust for a- </p><p>knight who lies. Do your will with me—I </p><p>am a helpless woman who can not wield’a </p><p>sword-”	- ....</p><p> “Small matter for that, Priices^.-when</p><p>you possess a tongue!” I retorted,-stung out </p><p>of my manners. “Since you chposejtp dis- </p><p>believe me, I will say no more; As -your </p><p>door is broken down, I must beg;you to'cross </p><p>the gallery and enter the room .thfrft atx the </p><p>right.” </p><p> She hesitated for a moment, looking as if</p><p>she would speak again, butnny grim manner </p><p>silenced her. She was tinning ajvay when </p><p>Pierre came hastily into the galley. </p><p> “Your pardon, Sir John,” he* Cried,.-much</p><p>excited, “but a small company:Qf;horse- </p><p>men are coming from the direction Cf‘Ver- </p><p>ona! What they want I can not guess, .for </p><p>they are not enough to storm the cas^e ~ ■ </p><p>“Wait for me below!” I cut him short.</p><p>Then, striding across the gallery, I'opened </p><p>the door of the room I had chosen: for the </p><p>ladies, bowed to them, and awaited their </p><p>entrance. The Princess stood motionless, </p><p>her color risen, her eyes bright as stars. </p><p> “Men are coming from Verona!” she</p><p>cried. “They are coming to find me, to </p><p>free me—is it not so? ” </p><p> “That, Princess,” I answered coldly, “is</p><p>what I propose to descend and discover, if </p><p>you will first oblige me by entering this </p><p>room.” </p><p> “You will keep me imprisoned here?”</p><p>she cried angrily. “You will let me know </p><p>nothing of this party that has ridden here </p><p>to help me? ” </p><p> •“Depend upon it, Princess, whatever</p><p>troop of horsemen ride to Castel Paura to </p><p>effect your liberty will turn tneir horses1 </p><p>heads back to Verona with their, object un- </p><p>fulfilled!” </p><p> Our eyes met in a clashing glance. “You</p><p>have the right of force, SirJohn'EJaw’kwqod,” </p><p>she said coldly, taking Francesca’s hand in </p><p>Sir John Hawkwood </p><p>253 </p><p>hers and drawing the girl forward. They </p><p>entered the room together, and I closed the </p><p>door and drew the outer bolt. </p><p> “ Come,” I said quickly to O’Meara, and</p><p>we ran swiftly up to the battlements of </p><p>the castle. </p><p>OFF in the distance a small group of </p><p>horsemen were riding in the direc- </p><p>tion of our stronghold. They might </p><p>have been a dozen, not more. “There is no </p><p>danger,” I said to the Irishman, drawing a </p><p>breath of relief as my eye ranged over them. </p><p>“But why are they coming here?” </p><p> O’Meara muttered an oath and caught</p><p>my arm “Do you see—do you see?” he </p><p>cried «xcitedly. “ ’Tis a woman there in the </p><p>midst bf them! Now by all that’s wonder- </p><p>ful,- Sir John, can you tell me what it is that </p><p>a woman’s wanting here? ” </p><p> “1 cari.tell you that she is here for no good</p><p>purpose,” I said curtly, “for I have just </p><p>reqogrijzed'Ker as Madonna Violante, Della </p><p>Torre’s -wife, and of all women I have ever </p><p>sceh she is thfc most dangerous. Let us go </p><p>down.info the court and set Pierre to par- </p><p>leying With them across the moat.” </p><p> That Worthy presently returned with a</p><p>puzzled face. “ It is my Lord Ranucio della </p><p>Torfe, Sir John—the Prince’s favorite,” he </p><p>tpJdYne. “He wants speech with you, and </p><p>begs .‘permission to enter with two of his </p><p>party. He will tell me nothing of his</p><p>business.” </p><p> “Cower the draw-bridge and let them in,”</p><p>I commanded, “but take care that no more </p><p>than three pass the portcullis.” </p><p> A moment later I heard the hoofs of the</p><p>horses rattling on the crazy draw-bridge. </p><p>My troopers came thronging into the court- </p><p>yard in great excitement. </p><p> Della Torre came first, a splendid sight,</p><p>as always, and as serene and haughty as </p><p>though he were riding into the royal palace </p><p>at Verona. I had seen very great gentlemen </p><p>look less at ease when surrounded by my </p><p>grim-faced ruffians, and much as I detested </p><p>my Lord Ranucio I admitted inwardly that </p><p>he was no coward. </p><p> Madonna Violante followed him. At</p><p>sigtft of her a cold shiver ran over me, a </p><p>presentiment of evil. And yet what harm </p><p>could come? Truly, I was growing woman- </p><p>ish i Hastily I turned to look at the third </p><p>arrival, who proved to be no other than </p><p>Gianni,Potrero. </p><p> There was "a- moment’s silence, then I</p><p>stepped forward with a low bow. “Wel- </p><p>come, my lady—welcome, my lord the fav- </p><p>orite, and you, sir knight of the noble order </p><p>of bravoes!” I cried, saluting each in turn. </p><p>“ Who would have guessed that one day Sir </p><p>John Hawkwood would receive so noble a </p><p>party in his own castle—that the great </p><p>Della Torre would be kept waiting at the </p><p>moat! Well, and how can I serve you, that </p><p>you deign to flatter me by taking note of </p><p>my existence?” </p><p> Messer Gianni gave me a very black look,</p><p>while Madonna Violante stared through me </p><p>as though I were made of air. As for Della </p><p>Torre, he dismounted slowly, came forward </p><p>a step, and spoke in a remote, indifferent </p><p>fashion. “Sir John Hawkwood,” he said, </p><p>“I have not come here to talk of your mad </p><p>and fatal act. All that you will settle later </p><p>with Prince Antonio. I have come here </p><p>to-day at my master’s bidding to demand </p><p>one thing of you, which, if you possess any </p><p>honor, you can not refuse.” </p><p> “Well?” I asked curtly. “It is plainly to</p><p>be seen you are no soldier, you waste so </p><p>much good time in words.” </p><p> He flushed and gave me an angry glance.</p><p>“Prince Antonio is filled with anguish at the </p><p>brutal seizure of his cousin,” he said, trying </p><p>to resume his measured fashion of speech. </p><p>“If you have any spark of chivalry left in </p><p>your nature, you will allow Madonna Vio- </p><p>lante to speak alone with the Princess and </p><p>to learn from her own lips whether she has</p><p>come to any harm.” </p><p> I stood in silence for a time, reflecting.</p><p>I was sure that some deep plot underlay the </p><p>seemingly simple request, and yet my reck- </p><p>less pride rose up. I hated Della Torre, I </p><p>hated Violante, and I would not have them </p><p>think that I feared them or anything they </p><p>might do. </p><p> I turned to O’Meara, who had stood at my</p><p>elbow throughout the scene. “Go to the </p><p>Princess,” I bade him. “ If she wishes for an </p><p>interview, the matter is all one to me.” </p><p>CHAPTER XX </p><p>BLACK CLOUDS </p><p> I TRUST, Sir John, that this is not a</p><p>trick,” Della Torre sneered, as Mi- </p><p>chael left us. “I know something of that </p><p>Irishman of yours—he would swear black </p><p>was white at your bidding.” </p><p>“Pray do not judge Messer O’Meara by </p><p>254 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>yourself, iry lord!” I answered politely. </p><p>“I am well aware that it is your business to </p><p>lie in your master’s service, and that you do </p><p>it with great success; but it is an accom- </p><p>plishment that I have never required from </p><p>my followers.” </p><p> A guffaw from my troopers pointed the</p><p>remark and increased Della Torre’s fury. </p><p>He fingered his sword-hilt, then controlled </p><p>himself with an effort. “You use insult </p><p>safely, Sir John Hawkwood!” he told me, </p><p>in a voice thickened with passion. “You </p><p>know that I can not stoop to fight you!” </p><p>“Perhaps it is more prudent in you to </p><p>refrain,” I mocked. “You remember, no </p><p>doubt, how I served your friend Lord </p><p>Raimondo.” </p><p> “1 prefer to wait,” he answered, white</p><p>with furj', “and see the business done by </p><p>hands more fit than mine to touch you! </p><p>The Prince has some pleasant plans for </p><p>your end, Sir John. You recall how he </p><p>served the traitor Cagliari? Your death </p><p>fall be more lingering-” </p><p> “He has not caught me yet,” I pointed</p><p>out. “ Keep your sympathy till it is needed, </p><p>my good friend. Is it the wheel he plans </p><p>for me, or will he despatch me secretly with </p><p>a dagger-thrust? I have heard that the </p><p>latter is his favorite device. Was it not so </p><p>that you and he rid Verona of Bartolomeo </p><p>della Scala?” </p><p> His pallor told me that the blow had gone</p><p>home. He was about to favor me with a </p><p>fierce retort when O’Meara’s voice an- </p><p>nounced from behind us that the Princess</p><p>desired instant speech with Madonna Vio- </p><p>lante. I shrugged my shoulders and bit my </p><p>lip, for I had entertained a feeble hope that </p><p>she might refuse, since she had no love for </p><p>She favorite’s shrewd, scheming wife. </p><p> Della Torre went over to his wife, assisted</p><p>her gallantly to dismount, and offered her </p><p>bis arm to lead her into the castle. I waved </p><p>him back. “ Messer O’Meara will escort the </p><p>Lady Violante to the Princess,” I stated </p><p>coldly. “You, my lord, will remain here.” </p><p>For the second time Della Torre flinched, </p><p>for his wife was the one person in the world </p><p>for whom he felt real tenderness. </p><p> “ What matter, my lord? ” she said, gently</p><p>loosening his clasp. “ I am not afraid. Sir </p><p>John Hawkwood, I see, enjoys the giving of </p><p>orders and the regulating of trifles. Well, </p><p>surely it would be cruel in us to deny him </p><p>this pleasure—he will have so short a time </p><p>'to play the master!” She gave me a con- </p><p>temptuous glance, then swept into the </p><p>castle, her head high, O’Meara following her. </p><p>looking rather grim. </p><p>FOR a time there was silence save </p><p>for the whispers of my staring </p><p> -	troopers. Della Torre was obviously</p><p>uneasy, Messer Gianni in the sulks. Being </p><p>none too happy myself, I decided to divert </p><p>myself with some further exchange of wit </p><p>with these two. </p><p> “Well, now, Potrero,” I began, “tell me</p><p>frankly, as one soldier to another, did you </p><p>not admire the pretty fashion in which I </p><p>seized your prey from under your nose at </p><p>the inn yesterday? ” </p><p> He scowled furiously. “He laughs best</p><p>who laughs last, Sir John,” he muttered. </p><p>“Yes, you played me a pretty trick, but for </p><p>all that I would not like to stand in }'our </p><p>boots now!” </p><p> “ You speak very mysteriously.. I see you</p><p>have a plot in progress against me,” I </p><p>remarked. “Faith, I am glad to be quit of </p><p>the Veronese Court—never did I see a place </p><p>so full of plots; they make the head of a </p><p>plain, blunt Englishman turn round. There </p><p>is Della Torre, for instance. Two days ago </p><p>he was plotting with his wife to forge a </p><p>packet in my hand, convey it to the Prince’s </p><p>notice, and so convict me of conspiracy with </p><p>Padua and put me from his way forever!” </p><p>Della Torre turned white .as death and </p><p>gazed at me as at an apparition from the </p><p>grave. </p><p> “You are mad!” he muttered through</p><p>dry lips, after a long moment of frightened </p><p>silence which I e'njoyed to the full. “W at</p><p>do you mean?” </p><p> “I mean that a man should not plan such</p><p>evil tricks in an open loggia where he may </p><p>well be overheard,” I answered airily, “ You </p><p>look extremely foolish, Della Torre. If the </p><p>Prince could see you now I think he would </p><p>regret that he ever gave his favor to a person </p><p>who so much resembled an imbecile. Take </p><p>my counsel—if you must blacken your noble </p><p>soul with such schemes, at least school your- </p><p>self to meet discovery without such a look </p><p>of guilt!” </p><p> “Keep your advice! ” he answered rudely,</p><p>recovering himself. “ It is you that are the </p><p>fool, Sir John Hawkwood. Had you flat- </p><p>tered the Prince and done all he bade you, </p><p>in time you might have supplanted me, and </p><p>ruled Verona! Instead, you stake your life </p><p>on this mad enterprise, the saints know why, </p><p>Sir John Hawkwood </p><p>255 </p><p>and will come to such an end as will make </p><p>you envy the traitor Cagliari! ” </p><p> “That is as may be,” I answered, shrug-</p><p>ging. “Whatever my fate proves, I shall </p><p>never envy you, my Lord Ranucio. But </p><p>here is Madonna Violante returned to bear </p><p>witness that I have not cut the Princess’ </p><p>throat or robbed her of her jewels!” </p><p> Della Torre’s wife paused beside us, as</p><p>calm and composed as ever. “ The Princess </p><p>is unhurt,” she said to her husband, “and </p><p>has met with no injury save the outrage of </p><p>the seizure, for which this man must an- </p><p>swer to the Prince. Come, we have done </p><p>our errand; let us get back to Verona.” </p><p>Della Torre helped her to her horse, </p><p>mounted his own, and made me a low and </p><p>mocking bow. “Farewell, Sir John,” he </p><p>sneered. “We give you thanks for your </p><p>courtesy. When we meet again, I think we </p><p>shall stand on a very different footing!” </p><p>“Since truthfulness and plain-speaking </p><p>are a soldier’s virtues,” I answered coolly, </p><p>“I must tell you with all frankness that it </p><p>would not greatly displease me were we </p><p>never to meet again.” </p><p> "I believe it!” he cried, with a mocking</p><p>iaugh. “But'the Prince desires otherwise </p><p>—and the Prince’s will be done, say I!” </p><p>Again he saluted me, and they moved slowly </p><p>out of the court-yard. </p><p> I turned to O’Meara. “ She did not come</p><p>here to pass the time of day with the Prin- </p><p>cess,” I said, knitting my brows. “What </p><p>have they got in their minds? ” </p><p> He shook his head. “I’ve no power to</p><p>read thoughts, but it’s mischief,” he said.</p><p>“Ah, I hate her—that woman! Were I </p><p>Della Torre, I would have cut her throat the </p><p>day after the wedding, except for the fact </p><p>that I would never have wedded her at all! ” </p><p>CHAPTER XXI </p><p>THE WAITING </p><p>THE day passed uneventfully, and the </p><p>night, and the next day. Under this </p><p>inactivity lay something that menaced me </p><p>—something that I would learn when it was </p><p>too l&amp;te. </p><p> Madonna Violante’s coming had one visi-</p><p>ble result—it wrought a change in the Prin- </p><p>cess’ behavior. Hardly had the little troop </p><p>ridden away from the castle when she sent </p><p>for me. “You are shrewd enough to know, </p><p>Sir John, that two helpless girls can not fly </p><p>across a moat,” she said, with some scorn, </p><p>“and therefore you surely need not fear to </p><p>let us go where we please within the castle </p><p>walls. I am not accustomed to imprison- </p><p>ment, and it wearies me. As for Madonna </p><p>Francesca, she is pining likeabird in a cage.” </p><p>I was willing enough to grant her request,, </p><p>for, now that my men believed they were to </p><p>gain a rich reward for taking her to Padua, </p><p>she was quite safe at their hands. “ Surely, </p><p>Princess, go where you please,” I answered. </p><p>“I would have given you the freedom of the </p><p>castle sooner had I guessed you would care </p><p>to wander about it.” </p><p> She shrugged slightly. “There is small</p><p>good in moping over what can not be </p><p>helped",” she said coldly. “ Come, Francesca, </p><p>we will go on the battlements and breathe </p><p>Spring air again, since our jailer is pleased </p><p>to be merciful.” </p><p> After that they roamed the castle at their</p><p>will. More than once I found her ques- </p><p>tioning one of my men in her haughty </p><p>fashion, and getting answers that were </p><p>roughly mil. Most of the time she sat on </p><p>the battlements gazing off in the direction of </p><p>Verona. O’Meara was often with them, for </p><p>the sight of Francesca seemed to draw him </p><p>like a magnet; and though -the Princess </p><p>treated him very coldly at first, I think she </p><p>ended by liking him, as indeed few people in </p><p>the world could have failed to do after a </p><p>brief acquaintance. </p><p> As for me, I held to myself and spent my</p><p>time in solitude. If there were hours when </p><p>I longed to join the group, if at times the </p><p>Princess’ proud pale face beckoned me even </p><p>as Francesca’s merry mocking eyes drew the </p><p>Irishman, I was too proud to yield. She </p><p>scorned and distrusted me when I was freely </p><p>risking my life to help her. Very good, she</p><p>should not have my hateful company to </p><p>endure. I preferred to pass lonely hours in </p><p>the castle hall, thinking of many things, </p><p>wishing vaguely that I might wipe out ten </p><p>years of my life and live them over in a </p><p>different fashion. Oh, I was not too happy, </p><p>and if there were sins in my life I think I </p><p>paid the price of them in those days when </p><p>I held the Princess prisoner for the sake of </p><p>her own good. </p><p>IT WAS near nightfall of the second </p><p>day, and for hours I had been strug- </p><p>gling fiercely with the longing to see </p><p>the Princess. I cursed myself angrily for </p><p>a fool. Far better to stay alone, to save at </p><p>Adventure </p><p> ieast a shred of dignity in her eyes by not</p><p> thrusting myself into her presence when she</p><p> had plainly shown me her contempt. And</p><p> yet, even as I told myself this, I got to my</p><p> feet and went slowly into the castle.</p><p> There were voices in the room that opened</p><p> from the gallery, and I paused at the door,</p><p> still silently urging myself to play the man</p><p> and remain apart. I could pass on un-</p><p> noticed. Yet I stood there motionless, gaz-</p><p> ing at the Princess, who sat by the window</p><p> with the last light of the sun falling across</p><p> her dark hair.</p><p>' She was thinking deeply, it appeared, for </p><p> her face was turned away from O’Meara and</p><p> Francesca. My heart beat more quickly as</p><p> I looked at her. She was the loveliest</p><p> woman in the world, I thought, and the</p><p> farthest from me by birth and nature. Why</p><p> was I standing there with my eyes glued to</p><p> her face? It gave me no pleasure, only</p><p> suffering, and I would do better to go see if</p><p> my men were keeping their watch.</p><p> “And so, glory be,” O’Meara con-</p><p> cluded, with great enthusiasm, “we drove</p><p> them flying before us into the back of. be-</p><p> yant, and the day was ours—and all thanks</p><p> to Sir John!”</p><p> The Princess turned slowly toward him.</p><p> “You think him a great man, this master of</p><p> yours?” she asked, with some scorn in her</p><p> voice.</p><p> “Was it master you said, Princess?”</p><p> O’Meara demanded, turning to her with</p><p> ready good-fellowship, for he was equally at</p><p> ease with a king or with a beggar. “No,</p><p> you’re wrong to use that word. There’s no</p><p> man in all this broad beautiful earth of ours</p><p> that can call himself master of an O’Meara.</p><p> But if you mean the finest general that ever</p><p> stepped, the rarest leader, the best friend</p><p> and greatest soldier, why then, yes, I’m</p><p> thinking he’s the greatest man I’ve ever</p><p> known or ever will know!”</p><p> I had dragged myself a few paces from the</p><p> door, repeating again and again that I must</p><p> not enter. Francesca’s pretty voice came</p><p> to me faintly as she broke in. “At first I</p><p> hated your captain,” she told him, “but now</p><p> there are times when I think he does not</p><p> appear altogether evil. He has the look of</p><p> one who suffers for his sins-”</p><p> “You are mad, child!” cried the Princess.</p><p> “Think of the tales they tell of him in</p><p> Verona—a ruffian, a cut-throat, drinking in</p><p> taverns, quarreling in the streets, swearing</p><p> and buffeting, ruling his men by terror!”</p><p>She broke off as if in utter distaste for my </p><p>many crimes. </p><p> My hesitation was at an end. Come what</p><p>might of it, I would see her and talk with </p><p>her, though heaven knew what I could say, </p><p>for her charges were all true enough, and I </p><p>had no intention of denying them. </p><p> “That’s as unjust a speech as ever you</p><p>uttered, Madonna!” cried my faithful com- </p><p>rade. “ You’ve heard these tales from Court </p><p>fops, I’ll swear—jackdaws not fit to touch </p><p>Sir John’s shoes! Let them once try to </p><p>equal what he’s done and they’ll change </p><p>their tune! ’Tis blithe I’d be to set them </p><p>in the midst of a bloody battle, with the </p><p>odds all against them and the day well-nigh </p><p>lost, and then see if they’d be after knowing </p><p>the way to bring order from slaughter and </p><p>victory from despair, as I’ve seen Sir John </p><p>do more times than I cculd count-” </p><p> “There, Michael, you have chanted my</p><p>praises enough,” I said, and they started as </p><p>I strode across the room. “I have just come </p><p>from the battlements, where the evening </p><p>breeze is very soft and sweet. Madonna </p><p>Francesca, I am sure, would enjoy it greatly </p><p>if you took her there to walk.” </p><p> Francesca, I thought, felt no great dis-</p><p>taste for the proposal, but she evidently con- </p><p>sidered it due herself to crush me for my </p><p>presumption. “I will go if the Princess de- </p><p>sires me to leave her, and not otherwise, Sii </p><p>John,” she answered saucily, with a fling of </p><p>her head. </p><p> Madonna Giulia folded her hands in her</p><p>lap and assumed a look of proud endurance. </p><p>“Have you not learned yet, child,” she </p><p>asked, “that Sir John Hawkwood is the </p><p>master here, and that we needs must do as </p><p>he wills? What matter whether I desire you </p><p>to go or stay, if he bids you go?” </p><p> “You wrong me, Princess,” I said, looking</p><p>at her straightly. “Do me the justice to</p><p>admit that I have not once entered your </p><p>presence save when you have sent to bid me </p><p>come. If you desire it, I will leave you nov. </p><p>—you are the mistress, and may command.” </p><p>“I had not guessed it!” she retorted. </p><p>“But there, what matter? Go, Francesca, </p><p>and I will stay to hear what our jailer de- </p><p>sires to tell me.” </p><p>FRANCESCA went out readily </p><p>enough, O’Meara following her in </p><p>unmistakable rapture at the pros- </p><p>pect of an interview in which to urge his </p><p>suit. The Princess and I kept silence for a </p><p>Sir John Hawkwood </p><p>257 </p><p>time, then she turned her head and looked </p><p>at me. “Perhaps, Sir John,” she said, “you </p><p>have thought better of my offer to out-bid </p><p>the Duke of Padua? Is it of that you wish </p><p>to jpeak?” </p><p> “No,” I answered grimly. Why had I</p><p>sought speech with one who had such power </p><p>to hurt me with every word? </p><p> “It would have been better for you had</p><p>you accepted that offer when I made it,” she </p><p>murmured, and I thought there was a tinge </p><p>of regret in her voice. “Now I shall escape </p><p>in spite of you, and the Prince will not show </p><p>you any mercy.” </p><p> “I do not need his mercy yet,” I an-</p><p>swered more cheerfully, “and I hope that </p><p>I never shall.” </p><p> We were silent again. I turned and</p><p>walked the length of the room twice or </p><p>thrice, seeking for words to express the </p><p>things I wished to tell her. Looking up sud- </p><p>denly, I caught her regarding me with a </p><p>gaze that held reluctant pity, and my </p><p>thoughts went back to Violante’s strange </p><p>visit. Then I forgot all else in the con- </p><p>sciousness of Madonna Giulia’s softer atti- </p><p>tude toward me, the sadder look in her </p><p>proud eyes, the gentler curve of her scarlet </p><p>lips. </p><p> It was she who broke the long silence, and</p><p>I started, fearing an angry word; but her </p><p>voice was curiously sad and gentle. “I </p><p>wonder why you ever came to Italy, Sir </p><p>John,” she said, as if to herself. “I wonder </p><p>what evil fate ever brought you to Verona.” </p><p>I did not answer her, lest my voice should </p><p>break the spell. </p><p> “You fought bravely in France,” she</p><p>went on, “you won a knight’s spurs, all men </p><p>honored you. What trick of destiny turned </p><p>you into such a path as this? Now you will </p><p>come to a most cruel end, you that might </p><p>have lived out a long and honored life in</p><p>your own land. It is a sad thought, and </p><p>against my will it hurts me.” </p><p> “I, too, have often wondered why fate</p><p>played such tricks with me,” I answered </p><p>soberly, “and have cursed destiny and my- </p><p>self. But now, Princess, I am content.” </p><p>She would not understand, I knew, that I </p><p>was content because I was now standing </p><p>between her and Antonio della Scala, the </p><p>one defense that kept her evil kinsman from </p><p>her. Surely this was payment enough for </p><p>all the sufferings of my life. </p><p> The trouble in her beautiful face was</p><p>growing steadily. She clasped her hands </p><p>and pressed thepi against her heart. “ There </p><p>is something under all this that I can not </p><p>understand,” she said, looking at me </p><p>strangely. ‘ ‘ There is more in you than I can </p><p>read, Sir John. I have felt it from the first, </p><p>and struggled against the belief, and tried to </p><p>think you entirely evil. But to-night— </p><p>when it is too late—I find myself doubting </p><p>and regretting.” The pride was all gone </p><p>from her eyes now, and only anxiety re- </p><p>mained. “ Sir John,” she said in a low, un- </p><p>certain voice, “tell me the truth! Tell me </p><p>why you brought me to this place!” </p><p> “Will you hear me without anger?” I</p><p>asked. “ Will you listen with an open mind </p><p>to a strange story?” </p><p> She bowed her head. “I will try,” she</p><p>answered. </p><p> “Then you shall hear,” said I, “.and I</p><p>swear by the soul of the Black Prince that I </p><p>will say no word that is not the truth!” </p><p>CHAPTER XXII </p><p>FOE LOVE OF A WOMAN </p><p>TJX)R a time there was silence in the dim </p><p>*	room, while I gathered my thoughts and</p><p>tried to still the beating of my heart, and </p><p>the Princess sat motionless, gazing at me </p><p>with that strange look of trouble always in </p><p>her eyes. At last I spoke. </p><p> “Before I tell you why I brought you</p><p>here,” I said, “there is something else that </p><p>you should know—something that has ruled </p><p>my actions for a long time, that has led us </p><p>both where we stand to-night. Will you </p><p>listen, Princess?” </p><p> “Yes,” she said, in a low voice.</p><p> “I have been in Verona for some eight</p><p>months,” I began. “I came here for no love </p><p>of the Scaligeri, but because Prince Antonio </p><p>offered me good payment for my sword. </p><p>You know what I am—a free companion, </p><p>wandering where my service takes me, fight- </p><p>ing now for one man and now another. It </p><p>is not a very noble profession, though as I</p><p>have practised it there is no dishonesty in </p><p>the trade. As for the life I have led, you </p><p>know that, too—I should be foolish to de- </p><p>fend it. I heard you tell O’Meara what </p><p>you held me—a swaggering cut-throat, a </p><p>drunken mercenary.” </p><p> “Perhaps,” she said wistfully, “I did you</p><p>wrong.” </p><p> “No, you were right,” I answered, for I</p><p>had sworn a solemn oath that she should hear </p><p>Adventure </p><p>only the truth from my lips. ‘'I was what </p><p>you thought me—though I think that now </p><p>I am somewhat better. Well, I came to </p><p>Verona and entered the Prince’s service. </p><p>One day I went to the palace to take leave of </p><p>him before marching for an attack on a </p><p>Paduan fortress. And then, suddenly, I saw </p><p>you for the first time.” </p><p> A startled look crossed her face. “You</p><p>saw—me? ” she murmured. </p><p> “Yes,” I said, “I saw you, standing in the</p><p>alcove of a window, with a jeweled lute in </p><p>your hands. You wore a dress the color of </p><p>dull gold, and had pearls on your neck and </p><p>in your hair. A little crowd of gentlemen </p><p>were all about you, and you were singing a </p><p>soft catch of song. I could repeat it word </p><p>?or word; it has rung in my ears ever since, </p><p>in battle, in quiet, even in my dreams. </p><p>When you had finished, all the room ap- </p><p>plauded you, and you smiled in a proud, in- </p><p>different fashion and tossed the lute away. </p><p>As you did so our eyes met. I suppose you </p><p>noted me no more than if I had been a </p><p>picture on the wall, but it was otherwise </p><p>with me. I went on into the Prince’s closet, </p><p>and he was greatly angered because I seemed </p><p>to pay no heed to what he told me. Faith, </p><p>I could not have listened to him then had he </p><p>possessed the tongue of an angel!” </p><p> The Princess had straightened herseif</p><p>slightly. “I do not understand, Sir John,” </p><p>she said, with pride and displeasure entering </p><p>her voice once more. “You are surely </p><p>wasting words. What matter when you saw </p><p>me first?”	#</p><p> “Be patient, Princess,” I answered, with</p><p>a slow smile. “When you know the truth </p><p>you will see that I deserve some kindness </p><p>from you—and I ask. as my rewafd only this </p><p>one hour, and the right to tell you freely </p><p>what is in my heart.” </p><p> She sank back in her seat, looking at me</p><p>with the same strange air of perplexity and </p><p>trouble. </p><p> “As time went on,” I continued, “I saw</p><p>you often. Many a time you passed me on</p><p>the streets, riding out to the hunt, or with </p><p>a falcon on your wrist. Sometimes I saw </p><p>you in the’palace garden, walking among the </p><p>flowers, or plucking roses and lilies. More </p><p>than once I watched when the Prince led you </p><p>out to dance, And always, always, from </p><p>the first moment when my eyes fell on you, </p><p>I loved you with my whole unworthy heart 1 ” </p><p> “ Sir John Hawkwood! ” she cried sharply.</p><p>“ How dare you say such words? How dare </p><p>you speak of love to me? You, a mercenary, </p><p>an adventurer!” Her softness was gone </p><p>now, and the scornful lady of the past looked </p><p>at me once more from her lovely face. </p><p>“YES, a mercenary, an adventurer, </p><p>unworthy, God knows, to touch your </p><p>finger,” I answered soberly. “But </p><p>yet a lover, worshipping you with as deep </p><p>and reverent an affection as any crowned </p><p>king or mighty hero ever gave his lady. 1 </p><p>had no thought that you would ever learn </p><p>it, no hope that I might ever win you. ] </p><p>believed that I would never even stand face </p><p>to face with you and change words on in- </p><p>different subjects. Knowing well how far </p><p>I stood below you, I had no wish to lower </p><p>you by any contact with me. And yet </p><p>whenever I might I gazed on you from a </p><p>distance, and suffered silently and endured </p><p>proudly—and loved you with all my heart, </p><p>with all my heart!” </p><p> “ You loved me—you? A tanner’s son? ”</p><p>she cried. It seemed to me that now there </p><p>was less anger in her tones, though she strove </p><p>hard to make them cruel. </p><p> “I am the son of a tanner,” I answered,</p><p>“yet I love you as never man loved woman </p><p>before! I could recount to you the tale of </p><p>each day I saw you, Once, as I passed you, </p><p>a clasp fell from your sleeve, and I raised it </p><p>and placed it in your hand. You thanked </p><p>me coldly, not glancing at me, and my heart </p><p>beat until it hurt my side. Since the day </p><p>when first 1 saw you, your face has been be- </p><p>fore me always. I saw it in camp when 1 </p><p>lay before the fire, and longed to sleep and </p><p>could not for the pain in my soul. I saw it </p><p>as I rode into battle, and it so maddened me </p><p>that at times I prayed for a straight sword- </p><p>thrust to end my useless life and all its </p><p>agony. Night and day I saw you, in the </p><p>streets, in the palace, in the conflict, in the </p><p>open country-” </p><p> “Say rather in the tavern!” she mocked</p><p>disdainfully. But her voice was faint now. </p><p> “Yes, in the tavern, too,” I said, "when</p><p>I sat over the cups till dawn. Does that </p><p>offend you? It is true. And many a night</p><p>I drank till I lost all knowledge, only be- </p><p>cause the dull pain in my heart was beyond </p><p>my bearing and I could not endure the </p><p>proud, indifferent gaze your eyes turned on </p><p>me. You were part of my life, Princess— </p><p>you were with me in my best moments and </p><p>in my worst ones. You have made me pay </p><p>for all my sins—never doubt it I When I </p><p>Sir John Hawkwood </p><p>*59 </p><p>thought of what you were, and of what I </p><p>was, and how far I had fallen from what I </p><p>might have been, then do you think I did </p><p>not suffer? ” </p><p> She did not speak. She was staring at</p><p>me, her face very pale in the gloom. Night </p><p>was coming fast, and I could see her only </p><p>with dimness now. </p><p> “There is no need that you should feel</p><p>anger at me,” I told her gently. “ My love </p><p>never harmed you. It harmed no one save </p><p>myself, and even to me it has brought great </p><p>good. Do you think, Madonna Giulia, that </p><p>I would have had it otherwise? I would </p><p>rather suffer for your sake than be happy </p><p>because I had never seen you. And I have </p><p>known happy hours, too. Will you hate me </p><p>if I tell you this? Well, I must take the </p><p>risk, since I have sworn to tell the truth. </p><p> “Sometimes I lay by the camp fire at</p><p>midnight and dreamed I was a great prince, </p><p>and free to tell you of my love. Sometimes </p><p>I pictured what I well knew could never be </p><p>—what I would not have had be, for your </p><p>sake. I dreamed that if you knew me, and </p><p>learned to love me, out of the nobleness of </p><p>your heart you might find the power to toss </p><p>away rank and greatness and gladly give </p><p>yourself to a poor soldier of fortune who </p><p>stood alone save for his sword. I saw my- </p><p>self shield you and protect you, and make </p><p>poverty so sweet a thing that you would </p><p>never look back with longing to the days </p><p>when you reigned a Princess. I saw you </p><p>Hearn that want, sweetened by love, is far </p><p>happier than state and power without it. I </p><p>pictured us all alone, you and I, hand in </p><p>hand, walking through life, well contented </p><p>sinte we had each other. Was not that a </p><p>foolish dream, Madonna Giulia? Yet it was </p><p>so dear to me that I could not tear it from </p><p>my heart! ” </p><p>THE room was dark now, and I </p><p>could see nothing but the dim out- </p><p>line of her form. She did not speak </p><p>as I paused, and I was glad, for I- had not </p><p>dared to hope that she would hear my tale </p><p>with so much patience.</p><p> “I had a third dream,” I said slowly.</p><p>“Sometimes I thought that, since I could </p><p>never possess you, it would be the crown of </p><p>my life if I might die in doing you some </p><p>service. I was accustomed to hold this the </p><p>most foolish of all my vain imaginings. And </p><p>yet at last the time has come when I can </p><p>serve you, and I do it gladly and proudly; </p><p>and if I die in the enterprise, I will die in the </p><p>most worthy act of all my life. First I </p><p>must get you into safety, then I care not a </p><p>jot what may come—it would be as well </p><p>that my life should end with its best deed.” </p><p> “End!” She breathed the word so softly</p><p>that I hardly heard it. </p><p> “You will think,” I said in a low voice,</p><p>“that my love was a poor thing, since it </p><p>made me no better than I was before. I </p><p>raged against fate, and my anger drove me </p><p>to many evil things, and day by day I made </p><p>myself more and more unworthy of a glance </p><p>from your eyes. In one short night I be- </p><p>came another man. Since I have brought </p><p>you here I have not been the mercenary who </p><p>served Antonio della Scala at Verona. I </p><p>have been an English knight once more.” </p><p> In the pause there was a sound of stum-</p><p>bling steps outside, and Pierre came in from </p><p>the gallery, bearing lights. The blackness </p><p>of the room flamed suddenly into brightness, </p><p>and I saw something that made my heart </p><p>leap. Pierre' set the candles down, then </p><p>stood staring stupidly until I curtly bade </p><p>him begone. </p><p> The Princess was lying back in her chair,</p><p>her face hidden in her arms, her shoulders </p><p>shaken. She was not angered at me for my </p><p>presumption, not embittered at my daring </p><p>—she was weeping as if her heart would </p><p>break. What had I done to wound her? </p><p>I cursed myself for a rough fool who had no </p><p>place among women, and racked my brains </p><p>for a way to soothe her. </p><p> “Are you weeping because you pity me,</p><p>madonna?” I asked, thrilling with joy de- </p><p>spite myself at the thought. “There is no </p><p>need. God knows I had not meant to pain </p><p>you! See you, although my love is mad and </p><p>hopeless, it has done great good, for as long </p><p>as I may live now I can never be again what </p><p>I was a week ago.” </p><p> She said nothing, and I crossed the room</p><p>and fell on one knee beside her. “ You have </p><p>brought back the old Sir John Hawkwood, </p><p>Princess,” I said, “and I thank you, and </p><p>am your servant for as long as my life shall </p><p>last.” I gently raised one of her hands from </p><p>where it lay against the chair, and touched</p><p>it to my lips. It had the chill of death. </p><p> “ That is all,” I said cheerfully, stepping</p><p>back. “I thank you for your patient hear- </p><p>ing, which will be a sweet memory to me in </p><p>days to come, when I am far from you and </p><p>may not see your face. Now I will tell you </p><p>what chanced in Verona a few days since* </p><p>260 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and why I brought you here to save you </p><p>from Antonio della Scala-” </p><p> “No, no, do not tell me! Ah, what mat-</p><p>ter now!” </p><p> The Princess had sprung up from her</p><p>chair and was fadng me, white as death, and </p><p>with such terror and anguish in her eyes as </p><p>made me cold with horror. </p><p> “What is it?” I cried. “What is it,</p><p>madonna?” </p><p> “I did not know!” she cried pitifully, ap-</p><p>pealing to me as if for pardon. “I did not </p><p>.know—you never told me! Ah, why did I </p><p>not hear you patiently on the first night you </p><p>brought me here? Now it is too late, and </p><p>there is no help-” </p><p> “What is it?” I cried again, frightened by</p><p>the look of pale anguish in her face. </p><p> “They are coming!” she wailed, throw-</p><p>ing her arm across her eyes. “They are </p><p>coming! Within the hour they will be here! ” </p><p>CHAPTER XXIII </p><p> THE SCARP WITH THE GOLD FLOWERS</p><p>CXDR a moment I stood staring at her, </p><p>^ too dazed for words. At last the mean- </p><p>ing of her warning burst on my clouded wits, </p><p>and I sprang forward and caught her by the </p><p>hand. “Be calm, Madonna Giulia,” I said </p><p>quietly, though my blood was all on fire. </p><p>"Do you mean that Antonio della Scala is </p><p>coming here to-night?” </p><p> She uncovered her eyes and looked wildly</p><p>at me, and the sight of her anguish moved </p><p>me as the thought of danger could never </p><p>have done. “Yes,” she murmured, half </p><p>inaudibly. </p><p> “But how can you know that? Who has</p><p>cold you?” I asked, in utter amazement. </p><p> “Madonna Violante,” she answered, with</p><p>cears of despair running down her cheeks. </p><p>“She came here, and you let her see me, and </p><p>together we formed the plot. You can do </p><p>nothing, they will be here within the hour!” </p><p>In an instant all was clear to me. “Ah!” </p><p>I cried, with a sudden sharp, unreasonable </p><p>bitterness gnawing at my heart, “you </p><p>plotted this with Madonna Violante—you </p><p>told me nothing of it! You did not trust </p><p>me ever so little, Princess, and yet I was</p><p>freely risking my life to do you service!” </p><p>Every vestige of her pride and scorn had </p><p>left her. She looked at me with the pale, </p><p>desperate face of a suffering child. “I did </p><p>not know that you loved me, that you wished </p><p>to help me! ” she wailed, her hands stretched </p><p>out in prayer for pardon. “You had not </p><p>told me this! I had heard you say that you </p><p>would sell me to Francesco Carrara to fill </p><p>your purse and the purses of your bravoes. </p><p>Madonna Violante told me that I was not </p><p>safe in your hands; she said that one day </p><p>you would boast that-” </p><p> “Do you not know that Ranucio della</p><p>Torre and his wife would lie away their souls </p><p>if they could gain thereby? Do you trust </p><p>them? Do you know me so little, when 1 </p><p>have striven so hard to serve you?” </p><p> “You had not spoken then,” she re-</p><p>peated drearily. “I did not know. Ah, </p><p>what have I done, Sir John? ” </p><p> “No great harm, save that by your mis-</p><p>trust you have hurt me,” I answered, forcing </p><p>myself to cheerfulness. “Let them come, </p><p>they shall not get you! We will give An- </p><p>tonio della Scala such a welcome as will be </p><p>little to his fancy!” I swung on my heel </p><p>with a laugh, for the prospect of a fight was </p><p>sweet to me. </p><p> She caught my arm: “Oh, you do not</p><p>understand! They will not attack the castle </p><p>walls!—they have a surer way to make their </p><p>entrance! I have killed you, Sir John, when </p><p>you were striving hard to serve me! All </p><p>my life I shall have your blood on my hands </p><p>and your death on my soul!” </p><p> A wild triumph filled me at the words, for</p><p>now I saw that she trusted me. “Tell me </p><p>all, madonna,” I said. “Never fear, I Mil? </p><p>find a way to outwit them.” </p><p> “You can not!” she moaned, and hid her</p><p>face again. “Antonio knows this castle well. </p><p>He knows the secret passage-” </p><p> “The passage!” My heart was beating</p><p>faster. </p><p> “Yes, yes. There is an underground pas-</p><p>sage that crosses beneath the moat and opens </p><p>through a moving block of stone in the </p><p>castle store-room. They can enter it </p><p>through a great hollow oak in the wood </p><p>yonder. They will come and take you, and </p><p>I have doomed you to certain death!” She </p><p>looked at me with hopeless eyes. </p><p> “No matter, Madonna Giulia,’’ 1 said</p><p>cheerfully. “I have seen more desperate </p><p>affairs than this. We will barricade the </p><p>entrance to the passage-” </p><p> She shook her head with a moan. :‘It is</p><p>too late! How can I tell you what I have </p><p>done? I begged you to give me the freedom </p><p>of the castle only that I might get speech </p><p>with your men, and T bribed your fellow </p><p>Sir John Hawkwood </p><p>261 </p><p>Jacques—the soldier whom you beat the </p><p>morning of the mutiny-” </p><p> “Yes,” I said. “Go on, Princess.” I</p><p>knew now that the matter was desperate, </p><p>but if my wild life had done me no other </p><p>good it had at least given me the power of </p><p>meeting danger with coolness, and my voice </p><p>was calm and unhurried. </p><p>SHE looked at me in amazement. </p><p>Do you not understand? ” she cried. </p><p> “I have brought you to ruin! The</p><p>man was eager for revenge. I bribed him </p><p>with the jewels I wore and a promise of </p><p>gold in the future, and he helped me.” </p><p> “I understand,” I answered. “What did</p><p>he do? Tell me in as few words as may be.” </p><p>“He has taken off the stones from the </p><p>mouth of the passage and left it free for </p><p>my cousin’s men.” she answered. “He has </p><p>done what you can not repair by hours of </p><p>work—and at any instant we may hear the </p><p>cries of my cousin’s men! They will kill </p><p>you—they will cut you down before my </p><p>eyes, or, worse, they will take you back to </p><p>Verona and end your life by torture! Why </p><p>do you not curse me, Sir John? ” </p><p> She had taken my wild look for anger, and</p><p>small blame to her. My calm was gone. </p><p>Jacques had made an entrance for An- </p><p>tonio’s men, and had ruined my scheme for </p><p>the saving of Antonio’s cousin. I could not </p><p>hold the castle now; the Princess was </p><p>doomed. </p><p> “Curse you, child?” I said at last, and</p><p>my voice had a strange hoarse note that I </p><p>had never heard in it before, but which I </p><p>had heard in the voices of men who turned </p><p>cowards at the pinch. The sound shamed </p><p>me, and yet I swear I felt no fear for myself </p><p>and took no thought for my own life. All </p><p>my mind was set on her. “Why should I </p><p>curse you? I am trying to devise a way to </p><p>save you. This is a terrible thing that you </p><p>have done so innocently! It will bring </p><p>you great trouble-” </p><p> “To me?” the Princess cried, raising her</p><p>face in a bewilderment that drowned her </p><p>terror. “ What harm can come to me? Are </p><p>you mad, Sir John? I shall be safe among </p><p>my own people; it is you that will be in the </p><p>hands of your foes-” </p><p> “You do not understand,” I said dully.</p><p>“ Can you not see that there were two plots </p><p>woven about you? The day I carried you </p><p>from the inn to the castle here, Gianni Po- </p><p>trero was hard upon my heels. He had been </p><p>minded to do the same thing—and by ths </p><p>Prince’s orders.” </p><p> “The Prince’s orders! And why?” ske</p><p>cried, staring. </p><p> “Because you would not wred him when</p><p>he wooed you,” I muttered, not thinking of </p><p>what I said, only wondering how I was to </p><p>save her. “He planned that you should </p><p>be carried off by Gianni Potrero, who was to </p><p>make pretense at holding you for ransom. </p><p>Later you were to be rescued by the Prince, </p><p>and he fancied that you would feel much </p><p>gratitude, and admiration for him and listen </p><p>more willingly to his suit. I overheard the </p><p>plot in the palace loggia, and planned to save </p><p>you by taking you to the Duke of Padua. </p><p>Do you understand now? ” </p><p> She did not answer me, and I turned to</p><p>look at her, struck by her silence. She could </p><p>have turned no whiter than she was before, </p><p>but all her strength seemed gone, and she </p><p>swayed and fell limply into her chair. She </p><p>believed me—she took my statement with- </p><p>out question, though it concerned her own </p><p>cousin! Even in this desperate pass I felt </p><p>a reckless triumph in the thought. </p><p> “Yes,” she breathed, struggling hard for</p><p>composure. “Yes, I understand at last. </p><p>In an hour I shall be in Antonio della Scala’s </p><p>hands and at his mercy in this wild, lonely </p><p>place! What will become of me when he </p><p>finds that I have no gratitude for him, that </p><p>I am not duped, that I fear and loathe him? </p><p>Oh, always I have known that he was an </p><p>evil man, though for the sake of our com- </p><p>mon blood I have struggled hard to think </p><p>otherwise! And of late I have had a horror </p><p>of him; when he wooed me the ghost of dead </p><p>Bartolomeo rose between us; I fancied I saw </p><p>blood upon his hands! He has sworn to wed </p><p>me, and to-night I will be in his power!” </p><p>She drew herself up with a gesture of des- </p><p>perate pride. Oh, I am ashamed, Sir John </p><p>—-I have ruined you and brought you to </p><p>your death, and now I am cold with fear of </p><p>my cousin and W'hat may come to me when </p><p>you are slain!” </p><p>(fgg| THINK as I might, rack my brains as </p><p>{JIIlP much as I chose, I could plan noth- </p><p>ing save to barricade the room into </p><p>which the secret passage opened, and hold it </p><p>as best I could; and this would prove effica- </p><p>cious only for a brief time. But now a new </p><p>thought flashed into my head, and I wheeled</p><p>to face the Princess with an exclamation </p><p>of joy. </p><p>262 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> She misunderstood me. “You do not</p><p>care what may come to me, then?” she cried </p><p>bitterly. “It does not distress you that I </p><p>shall fall into my cousin’s power? Ah! then </p><p>all this talk of love with which you enter- </p><p>tained me a few moments since was but a </p><p>cheat?” </p><p> “No, Princess,” I answered quietly. “I</p><p>love you, and it is for me to save you—and </p><p>so I shall do, with God’s help. Be calm </p><p>now, waste no time in fear, for we shall be </p><p>hard pressed to carry out my scheme before </p><p>Antonio comes.” </p><p> “You will save me?” she cried in-</p><p>credulously. </p><p> Voices and laughter came to us from with-</p><p>out. Francesca and her Irish lover were </p><p>returning from the battlements. A mo- </p><p>ment later they were in the room, and the </p><p>laughter died on their lips as they gazed </p><p>from the Princess’ white face to my grim, </p><p>set one. </p><p> “What’s gone amiss, Sir John?” O’Meara</p><p>cried, springing forward and catching me by </p><p>the arm. </p><p> I laid my hand on his shoulder and drew</p><p>him to me. “Michael,” I said soberly, </p><p>“you are the one friend I have in all the </p><p>world. I have trusted you for years, though </p><p>I trust no one else on earth. You would not </p><p>refuse me anything on which my heart was </p><p>set, would you, lad? ” </p><p> He looked bewildered and somewhat emo-</p><p>tional. “Faith, and I think you’ve got no </p><p>need to ask that!” he answered, almost </p><p>angrily. “It’s ask and have, Sir John! </p><p>Tell me to go to Verona and strike the Prince </p><p>across the face, or to besiege the city walls </p><p>all alone, and I’ll not say no-” </p><p> “I am sure of that,” I answered, keeping</p><p>my hold on his shoulder. “ But would you </p><p>do something harder, Michael? Would you </p><p>turn your back on a deadly fight for my </p><p>sake, and ride for safety as fast as ever your </p><p>horse could take you? ” </p><p> The Irishman’s expressive features twisted</p><p>in an obvious struggle. “ ’Tis a deal to ask </p><p>of any man, and above all of one of my </p><p>country,” he cried, “but, bedad, I love you </p><p>so well I believe I’d be after doing even that </p><p>if you asked it! But you’ll not ask it, will </p><p>you, Sir John, dear?” he pleaded, in mani- </p><p>fest alarm. </p><p> “I must, Michael,” I answered. He was</p><p>staring at me now with his mouth fallen </p><p>open. Francesca, conscious that an evil </p><p>moment was upon us, had run to the Prin- </p><p>cess and put her arms about her. “Antonio </p><p>della Scala is to come here within the hour, </p><p>and will enter by a secret passage that runs </p><p>beneath the moat. We can not resist him, </p><p>therefore we must not let him find the Prin- </p><p>cess here. I had meant, as you know, to </p><p>remain here until a strong troop of Floren- </p><p>tines might escort Madonna Giulia safely </p><p>across the Paduan boundaries, but since </p><p>this is impossible you must take her to-night </p><p>—at once. You shall have twenty men; it is </p><p>not a great number, but I can do nothing </p><p>better for you. Ride as if the devil were at </p><p>your heels, cut through any obstacles that </p><p>cross your way, never draw rein for an </p><p>instant till you reach Padua and Duke </p><p>Francesco!” </p><p> “And what of yourself meanwhile, Sir</p><p>John?” said O’Meara, in a very low voice. </p><p> “Oh, I shall have plenty to do, never</p><p>doubt it,” I answered cheerfully. “I will </p><p>remain here and hold the castle as long as </p><p>may be against the Prince, that he may be- </p><p>lieve Madonna Giulia is still here and make </p><p>no move to pursue her. That should give </p><p>you a safe start.” </p><p>“YES, we should get away safely,” </p><p>said O’Meara, vaguely and indiffer- </p><p>ently, as if he cared little whether </p><p>they did or not. “But you? ’Tis signing </p><p>your own death-warrant you are-” </p><p> “Hush!” I whispered fiercely, with a</p><p>glance at the Princess. He broke off and </p><p>stood silent, very pale, biting at his lip. I </p><p>went over to Madonna Francesca and spoke </p><p>to her gently. “ Madonna, you can help us </p><p>greatly in this matter if you choose. Are </p><p>you brave enough to run some risk for the </p><p>sake of your lady? ” </p><p> She looked at me in a bewildered fashion.</p><p>“I do not understand,” she murmured. </p><p>“ The Princess is in no danger—what harm </p><p>can come to her through falling into her </p><p>cousin’s hands? It is what she desires-” </p><p> “No, no, child!” cried the Princess des-</p><p>perately. “ I have been tricked, I have been </p><p>duped by the Prince! It was his plan to </p><p>have me brought here that he might force </p><p>me into marriage with him. Sir John heard </p><p>the plot and did all that a true knight could </p><p>to save me, and in my madness I have ruined </p><p>him! If Antonio takes me now, the Virgin </p><p>help me!” </p><p> “Will you aid us in saving your lady?”</p><p>I asked Francesca again.</p><p> She drew away from the Princess and</p><p>Sir John Hawkwood </p><p>263 </p><p>stood erect, her pale face raised. “I am not </p><p>brave, and I am very foolish and feather- </p><p>headed,” she answered, with a pitiful little </p><p>effort at mirth, “ but I would gladly give my </p><p>life for Madonna Giulia! Tell me how I </p><p>may help her and you shall have no cause </p><p>to call me coward.” </p><p> “Then you must stay here in the castle</p><p>while she leaves us,” I answered. “ O’Meara, </p><p>go get your men to horse! Choose out the </p><p>most evil and greedy of the troop—the ones </p><p>who would be most like to fail me when they </p><p>found the pinch a hopeless one; in that way </p><p>I shall have the stancher men left for the </p><p>holding of the castle, and you will have no </p><p>trouble, for those who ride with you will </p><p>look for a rich reward in Padua.” </p><p> He hesitated, looking at me uncertainly.</p><p>“I’ve said I’d leave you, and I’ll be keeping </p><p>my word, though it hurts me near beyond </p><p>all bearing to do it,” he said, coming close </p><p>to me. “But Madonna Francesca there, </p><p>Sir John? Sure, and death is all in the </p><p>day’s work for us men, but what of a </p><p>sweet little girl like that who never has </p><p>looked on a drop of blood and never </p><p>should? Have we got the right to bring </p><p>her into peril?” </p><p> She had heard him, and even at this mo-</p><p>ment a faint smile played about her mouth. </p><p>“I shall not be in great danger, Messer </p><p>O’Meara,” she said prettily, coming up and </p><p>laying her fingers on his arm. “ Prince An- </p><p>tonio will not dare do me any serious evil, </p><p>no matter how far I enrage him. My </p><p>family is poor now, but we have kinsmen </p><p>who are powerful, and all Verona would cry </p><p>out if harm came to me. Never fear! But </p><p>I would—I would-” She broke off with </p><p>tears filling her eyes. </p><p> “What then, mavourneen?” he cried</p><p>passionately. </p><p> “I would,” she repeated, between tears</p><p>and laughter, “that you were not going, </p><p>Messer O’Meara! You must find means to </p><p>come back to Verona some day, for if I </p><p>should never see you again-” </p><p> “Yes? Yes? Tell me, then?” he urged</p><p>eagerly. </p><p> “I would find me a convent!” she an-</p><p>swered, sobbing and laughing at one and the </p><p>same time. “ For I will be a nun, I vow it, </p><p>before my Lord Ravignani shall call me </p><p>wife, or any other noble of Verona, or any </p><p>..nan on earth save—save-”</p><p> It was here that O’Meara forgot all the</p><p>■world in his rapture and caught her in his </p><p>arms and covered her face with kisses. She </p><p>clung to him, laughing joyfully through her </p><p>tears, as pretty a picture as I had ever seen; </p><p>and though I well knew that every moment </p><p>was precious to me, I had not the heart to </p><p>interrupt the brief heaven of these two who </p><p>might never meet again on earth. </p><p>“SIR JOHN HAWKWOOD,” said </p><p>the Princess’ voice in my ear. She </p><p>was standing close beside me, pale </p><p>and tense, but very composed. “I will not </p><p>go!” she said, and with an accent of finality </p><p>that chilled me. “I have caused all this by </p><p>my own fault. I shall stay, and share the </p><p>evil that is coming. That is the only repara- </p><p>tion I can make you now!” </p><p> The other two were oblivious to us, and</p><p>did not see that I bent and took both the </p><p>Princess’ hands in mine. “You speak like a </p><p>great lady and a brave woman,” I answered, </p><p>“but you are wrong. There is a greater </p><p>reparation than that which you can make </p><p>me. Whether you stay or go, my death is </p><p>certain; but it rests with you whether I die </p><p>in all content, having redeemed my spotted </p><p>life in some part, or whether I die with all </p><p>my sins uncleansed and my heart in a tu- </p><p>mult of despair. Go—let me feel that I have </p><p>saved you, that I have not lived in vain. </p><p>You will let me die in peace, Madonna </p><p>Giulia? I have tried to serve you, I have </p><p>risked all in your behalf, and this is my first </p><p>and last prayer, the only thing that I shall </p><p>ever ask you.” </p><p> She was silent for a long moment, and I</p><p>saw that there were heavy tears on her </p><p>lashes. “Yes, I will go,” she said at last, </p><p>very softly. </p><p> “I thank you, Princess.” I could say no</p><p>more than that in a steady voice. </p><p> She raised her eyes to mine, and they had</p><p>a wonderful star-like look. “ Do you remem-' </p><p>b'er, Sir John,” she said, “that one day in </p><p>the palace loggia—it was the afternoon when </p><p>you would have warned me of my cousin, </p><p>and I would not listen—you took my scarf? </p><p>Have you it now?” </p><p> “Yes,” I answered, in amazement.</p><p> “Then give it to me,” she said.</p><p> “You desire it?” I asked, with a keen</p><p>stab of pain at my heart. “I was unworthy </p><p>of it when I took it, true—but am I all un- </p><p>worthy now? May I not keep it until the </p><p>end, tie end which will soon be here?” </p><p> She shook her head and held out her hand,</p><p>Slowly, biting my lips to keep down the</p><p>264 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>pain, I drew the soft, gold-embroidered </p><p>thing from the breast of my doublet and </p><p>gave it to her. She took it, and now I saw </p><p>that she was smiling in a wonderful fashion </p><p>such as I had never before seen on the lips </p><p>of any woman, it was at once so sweet and </p><p>so sad. </p><p> “You are the only man who has ever</p><p>served me for my own sake and for no object </p><p>of his own,” she said softly. “You are the </p><p>truest knight I have ever known, Sir John!” </p><p>And with her own hands she passed the </p><p>scarf across my shoulder and knotted it over </p><p>my bright cuirass. </p><p> For a moment I could find no words, nor</p><p>any power to speak them. Coming to my- </p><p>self at last, I went on one knee and kissed </p><p>her hand. “Princess,” I said, my voice </p><p>quavering in a womanish fashion, for which </p><p>I felt no shame at all, “you have given me </p><p>back my knighthood, and I ask no greater </p><p>joy or honor than to die for you!” </p><p> TO BE CONCLUDED</p><p>ENTS R, THE HERO </p><p>BY RUTH COMFORT MITCHELL </p><p>OWN through the endless miles </p><p>of maguey fields, gray-green and </p><p>dusty under the glare of the hard </p><p>turquoise sky, past huddled brown </p><p>villages, leaving the Pyramids behind and </p><p>picking up the faint silhouette of Mt. Ori- </p><p>zaba on the horizon, swaying, lurching, the </p><p>.Vera Cruz train sped eastward, Mr. Gelb- </p><p>hauser’s new private car “Dianthe” play- </p><p>ing “snap-the-whip” on the end. </p><p> Young Tommy Jerrolds, who had been</p><p>asked only to play with the Levering girls, </p><p>and hadn’t said ten words to them since </p><p>they left Los Angeles, held his usual point </p><p>of vantage beside Miss Millard, reveling </p><p>alike in her favor and the scowls of Herman </p><p>Gelbhauser, Jr., who regarded him wrath- </p><p>fully from across the aisle. The boy </p><p>stooped to rescue the book which slipped </p><p>from her lap to the floor. “ That’s five times </p><p>in half an hour! Must be studying hard!” </p><p>Miss Millard nodded her thanks without </p><p>turning her gaze from the window. “I’m </p><p>too busy, Tommy.” </p><p> “Heavens!” he protested, “What can</p><p>you see in this endless pulquc-'psXcYi? Miles </p><p>upon miles of smiles, acres of mornings </p><p>after-” </p><p> She shook her head impatiently. “Oh,</p><p>not this, especially, but all of it—the coun- </p><p>try—the people—the air—I can’t explain it! ”</p><p>Her host leaned toward her, his broad </p><p>face beaming. “I’m delighted that you </p><p>are enjoying yourself, Miss Millard. There </p><p>is, indeed, much of interest—to one capable </p><p>of appreciating it.” </p><p>Enter, the Hero	265</p><p> “Whew, I guess that cut!” said young</p><p>Tommy cheerfully. “But lea've your scene- </p><p>less scenery long anough to do your Span- </p><p>ish, Miss Di! Come on—we’d gone as far </p><p>as ‘What does Your Honor’s Papa want?’ </p><p>‘He wants the soap,’ and ‘The young lady </p><p>needs the silk handkerchief of the French- </p><p>man’—(careless young lady!) Now then; </p><p>'Que necesita la-” </p><p> “Mr. Gelbhauser, you’ll have to come</p><p>and play the rubber with me!” called a </p><p>cross voice from the other end of the car. </p><p>“Jim’s asleep again!” </p><p> Herman Gelbhauser rose reluctantly, and</p><p>Miss Millard turned to the boy with a </p><p>quick whisper. “Tommy, you mustn't 1’’ </p><p> “Well, you know you don’t want-”</p><p>he began defensively, but she cut him short </p><p> “Shi Do go and talk to the girls!”</p><p> “Oh, they’re busy!” He looked over his</p><p>shoulder to where the Misses Levering </p><p>lolled in their chairs and jabbed vicious eye- </p><p>lets in their embroidery. “Look here, it’s </p><p>none of my business, but I know you’re not </p><p>strong for Hermie! You can’t be!” His </p><p>freckled face flushed hotly. “You’re so </p><p>beautiful and keen, you’re there a million; </p><p>and what’s he, besides the old codger’s </p><p>son?” he nodded to the farthest corner of </p><p>the car where a little old man with a hand- </p><p>kerchief over his head snored gently. </p><p> Miss Millard’s lip curled. “Vulgarly</p><p>speaking, Tommy, fie’s ‘there a million’— </p><p>several of them.” </p><p> “Don’t!” said the boy sharply. “It</p><p>isr’t like you.” </p><p> She squared herself to the window, her</p><p>elbows on the sill, and watched the sliding </p><p>picture with somber eyes. “ I don’t see why </p><p>you think anything that’s sordid and cal- </p><p>culating and mean is unlike me It’s all </p><p>I’ve known.” </p><p> “Well, it’s not!” doggedly. “And it</p><p>makes me hot to have that bunch down </p><p>there talking you over, saying you’ll make </p><p>up your mind on this trip whether it’s to be </p><p>Hermie or Chase!” </p><p> A slow blush spread over Diana Millard’s</p><p>beautiful face from chin to brow. “I don’t </p><p>know why I let you talk to me like this.” </p><p>Young Tommy moved closer. “I’ll tell </p><p>you. Because you know I’m only a kid,</p><p>and out of the running, and because I—I </p><p>understand, and know you’re the sweetest, </p><p>finest—well, you are, and it makes me sick </p><p>to hear them betting it’ll be Chase, because </p><p>his pictures are the rage, or Hermie, with </p><p>his imitation polish and the old man’s </p><p>money—and the car that he named for you </p><p>as near as he dared!” </p><p> From the group at the other end came</p><p>the acid aftermath: “Well, naturally, when </p><p>I led you the ten!”—“Make up your own </p><p>signals as you go along, don’t you?” A </p><p>man pushed his chair back noisily, and </p><p>flung himself out on to the platform, bang- </p><p>ing the door behind him. </p><p> “Hermie’s car,” said the boy softly,</p><p>“full of sweet, jolly, congenial people who </p><p>like him for himself alone! Miss Di-” </p><p>The train jarred to a standstill with a great </p><p>flurry of whistles and bells, and the occu- </p><p>pants of the “Dianthe” sprang to their </p><p>feet in welcoming haste. </p><p> Miss Millard stood on the lowest step</p><p>and let the rest clamber past her,watching </p><p>them merge into the stream of Pullman </p><p>passengers who rushed to the venders of </p><p>dulces and tortillas, and the shacks of the </p><p>Mexicans. </p><p> “Not going to mingle?” asked Derwent</p><p>Chase, joining her. </p><p> “No,” said the girl disgustedly. “Look</p><p>at them, crowding into their huts, stepping </p><p>on the dogs, snatching up the babies, peek- </p><p>ing into the kettles, laughing at them— </p><p>ugh! We’re the barbarians!” </p><p> She looked over the snarl of people on</p><p>the platform to the rolling brown country </p><p>where a dusty road led away to the dimp- </p><p>ling hills. Four oxen plodded toward them, </p><p>drawing a crude, two-wheeled cart piled </p><p>high with golden hay, their great heads </p><p>pushed forward under the heavy beam </p><p>bound to their horns. Beside them pat- </p><p>tered a peon, all in dingy white, save for his </p><p>yellow sombrero and the scarlet band at his </p><p>waist. A pair of forlorn minstrels, a blind </p><p>man steered by a little, lame old woman, </p><p>wormed their way through the crowd and </p><p>halted before Diana, wailing a mournful </p><p>ballad to the thin strumming of the man’s </p><p>guitar. </p><p> Young Jerrolds hurried back to his post.</p><p>“Some class, isn’t it? ” he grinned. “Looks </p><p>like a stage setting—all the scenery and the </p><p>chorus, and—by Jiminy, look! There in </p><p>the station door—‘Enter the Hero!’” </p><p>STANDING in the low doorway, </p><p>like a picture too large for its frame,</p><p>was a tall man in well worn English </p><p>riding-clothes, his fresh coloring and the </p><p>fair hair under his canvas helmet in striking </p><p>266 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>contrast to the dusky faces about him. He </p><p>stood for a moment looking with frank curi- </p><p>osity at the tourists thronging the plat- </p><p>form, his blue eyes resting f5r a permissible </p><p>second on Miss Millard, th*i swung past </p><p>them and boarded the car ahead. </p><p> “ Say, me for him, strong!” cried Tommy</p><p>warmly. “Kind of a cross between the </p><p>‘Brushwood Boy’ and that fellow in ‘Sol- </p><p>diers of Fortune’! By golly, I bet that chap </p><p>knows lots about this country! I’m going </p><p>to talk to him! See you next station!” he </p><p>raced down the platform as the train began </p><p>to move, and jumped on the steps of the </p><p>Pullman. </p><p> “I dare say you can spare the Infant</p><p>Class? ” laughed Chase, as he took Tommy’s </p><p>seat. </p><p> The train had hardly slowed down for</p><p>the next town when the boy rushed back </p><p>to the “Dianthe.” “Say, Mr. Gelbhauser, </p><p>there’s a mighty interesting fellow in there </p><p>—think you’d all enjoy him. Can I bring </p><p>him in?” </p><p> Herman, Jr., considered ponderously.</p><p>“That will be as the ladies of the party </p><p>wish,” he said, looking only at Miss Millard. </p><p> Diana looked at the boy’s eager face, and</p><p>then smiled at her host: “It might be very </p><p>pleasant.” </p><p> “Tell your friend—if you’re sure, of</p><p>course, that he’s a proper sort of person— </p><p>that we’ll be pleased to have him join us </p><p>for tea,” said Mr. Gelbhauser graciously, </p><p>and Tommy dashed oil to return with his </p><p>discovery in tow. </p><p> He was one Edgar Blythe-Masterson, it</p><p>seemed, late of England, and now in charge </p><p>of an extensive sugar hacienda near Cor- </p><p>doba. The “Dianthe’s” party in the main </p><p>fell upon him with the cordiality born of </p><p>much boredom, and he took their tea and </p><p>cakes and their advances with frank appe- </p><p>tite. Tommy, curled into an incredibly </p><p>small space on the floor that he might be </p><p>near his divinity, listened rapturously, </p><p>looking up at her for approval when the </p><p>Englishman, in answer to the queries of the </p><p>other men, told of crops and conditions and </p><p>politics and, by reason of quaint diction and </p><p>much ingenuous earnestness, infused the </p><p>simplest statement with color and warmth. </p><p> “Then it isn’t all poppycock, this revolu-</p><p>tion story?” asked Chase. “There’s al- </p><p>ways danger of an outbreak? ” </p><p> Tommy saw Diana’s dark eyes traveling</p><p>consideringly from the newcomer to Her- </p><p>man Gelbhauser, much too carefully dressed </p><p>and mannered; to Chase, weary-eyed and </p><p>much too clever; to the other men of the </p><p>group, modifications of the two types. </p><p> “Well, rather!” the Englishman an-</p><p>swered with a laugh. “Down here in the </p><p>tierra caliente things are always simmering, </p><p>d’you see?—and the lid’s just about due to </p><p>fly off again. There’s a charcoal-burner, a </p><p>sort of half-witted chap—Florenzio some- </p><p>thing-or-other—who thinks he’s had visions, </p><p>and they’ve been rioting all over the shop, </p><p>with him at their head. Oh, there’ll be </p><p>nothing big, you know—the Government </p><p>will be dow'n on them like a shot before </p><p>they’re fairly started, and stand a hundred </p><p>of ’em against a wall and snuff out. the revo- </p><p>lution with a few volleys, and the vision </p><p>chap will be packed off to San Juan de </p><p>Ulua—the very unpleasant island prison </p><p>you’ll see in the harbor of Vera Cruz—to </p><p>rot out his life in a cell where the water’s </p><p>knee-deep at high tide, and-” </p><p> “Nevertheless,” Gelbhauser cut in with</p><p>authority, “it’s generally conceded that the </p><p>Government is most excellent, and that </p><p>Diaz has redeemed Mexico from a nation </p><p>of savages.” </p><p> “ Granted,” said Blythe-Masterson pleas-</p><p>antly. “He’s a Napoleon, of a sort, is Diaz, </p><p>and he’s worked nothing short of a miracle </p><p>with the crude stuff he took hold of, but—” </p><p>he hesitated, “you can’t have omelette with- </p><p>out breaking eggs, and there’s always the </p><p>other view-point. And so long as there are </p><p>fellows who think it a glorious privilege to </p><p>get themselves shot or sealed up alive for </p><p>the sake of ‘Libertad,’ we’ll be having </p><p>revolutions!” </p><p> “But, my gracious, Mr. Blythe-Master-</p><p>son,” chirped the elder Miss Levering, </p><p>“isn’t it dangerous, living in such a wild </p><p>country?” </p><p> “Oh, of course, there’s always the off</p><p>chance that some misguided patriot will </p><p>pot you on general principles, but I rub </p><p>along very comfortably. Y’ see, I’ve tucked </p><p>away a run-away enganchador or two— </p><p>contract laborers, you know—and the Beg- </p><p>gars know I’ve a leaning to their side.” </p><p> “Does your company like to have you</p><p>risk antagonizing the Government?” asked </p><p>Herman, Jr. </p><p> “My—oh, I’m for myself, you see. Yes,</p><p>it makes it rather jolly. I shouldn’t like </p><p>being accountable. My word, here’s Ori- </p><p>zaba, and I’m-getting off here! I’ve en- </p><p>Enter, the Hero </p><p>267 </p><p>joyed meeting you no end! You’ll be stay- </p><p>ing over in C6rdoba, of course, and you’ll </p><p>all come out to the hacienda for tea? Or— </p><p>better still—stop the night? That would </p><p>be jolly! I’ve a goodish bit of room, for </p><p>I’m expecting the people from home over </p><p>this year, and I can perfectly well put you </p><p>up. I’ll call it a promise, then?” </p><p> He stood with his hand on young Tommy’s</p><p>shoulder, his cheery glance running over the </p><p>languid group till it rested eagerly on Miss </p><p>Millard. </p><p> “Good-by, then, for a bit—Beg pardon?</p><p>You’re having the car cut off here? You’re </p><p>staying over in Orizaba? Oh, I say, what </p><p>luck!” he dropped into his chair again with </p><p>.frank delight. </p><p>• </p><p>AND so it fell out that when the </p><p>“Dianthe” started on the wonderful </p><p>drop from Orizaba to Cordoba three </p><p>days later, on a marvelous green and gold </p><p>morning, it was the Englishman who sat </p><p>beside Miss Millard on the observation plat- </p><p>form, Tommy standing guard close by, and </p><p>Messrs. Gelbhauser and Chase hovering </p><p>unhappily in the middle distance. The </p><p>boy managed to whisper in her ear: “ Guess </p><p>I’m poor as a discoverer—T. Columbus </p><p>Jerrolds, please write! ” And Diana blushed </p><p>“ the bjushiest blush you ever saw,” Tommy </p><p>wrote his mother afterwards, “and there </p><p>your Angel Son sat, playing the Human </p><p>Barbed Wire Fence, listening to scraps </p><p>iike—‘And so you’ve been in Surrey,’ (beeen, </p><p>Mumsie!) ‘almost in sight of my home! </p><p>Only fancy 1’—and Chase and Iiermie </p><p>thirsting for my gore!” </p><p> All too soon there was C6rdoba smiling</p><p>up at them, and then Cordoba station, with </p><p>the villagers drawn up to meet the train for </p><p>all the world like a comic-opera chorus, and </p><p>a slim Mexican with Chesterfieldian man- </p><p>ners riding a dancing horse and leading an- </p><p>other to meet Blythe-Masterson, who </p><p>called a hearty “Hello, Romaldo! How </p><p>are you?” </p><p> “ Senor,” replied Romaldo with a glitter-</p><p>ing sftiile, with great difficulty removing </p><p>his sombrero and restraining both horses, </p><p>“I am your Honor’s servant who kisses </p><p>your hands, and all is well at Las Golon- </p><p>drinas!”</p><p> They watched the Englishman mount</p><p>and ride away, the elegant Romaldo falling </p><p>correctly behind, but his master pulled up </p><p>sharply at a shrill cry, leaning down to </p><p>greet a droll little row lined- up to meet </p><p>him. There were two tiny boys, almost </p><p>eclipsed by sombreros, and three small girls </p><p>with heads sedately covered by rebosas, the </p><p>youngest sucking a bashful finger. He </p><p>leaned gravely down to shake each one </p><p>by the hand, rummaged in his pocket for a </p><p>parcel of dulces, waved again to the “Di- </p><p>anthe” and clattered off down the sunny </p><p>street. </p><p> Mr. Gelbhauser’s party climbed on the</p><p>mule-car which runs between the station </p><p>and the town and were jolted through </p><p>avenues of tropical trees, past the clamor </p><p>of the market-place, beside the gay plaza </p><p>with the old cathedral on its edge, into the </p><p>heart of the tierra caliente. </p><p> “Wonder which way his hacienda is?”</p><p>said Tommy. “Will we go out to-day or </p><p>to-morrow?” </p><p> “I don’t know that we will go either to-</p><p>day or to-morrow,” answered his host </p><p>crisply. “We are probably capable of en- </p><p>tertaining ourselves during our brief stay. </p><p>There seems nothing to see—besides the </p><p>laziest set of idlers we’ve seen yet!” </p><p> “That fellow frivoling away his time with</p><p>the Saratoga, for instance? ” asked Tommy </p><p>sweetly, pointing to a slender youth with a </p><p>heavy trunk slung on his back and a basket </p><p>in his hands. “Or his friend loafing along </p><p>behind with the four suit-cases and the two </p><p>satchels?” </p><p> “ The gentleman transplanting the boiler</p><p>seems to be rather busy, too,” laughed </p><p>Chase, nodding toward an aguador, trotting </p><p>briskly under his enormous water-jar, and </p><p>Herman, Jr., joined grudgingly in the laugh. </p><p> Perhaps it was the aftermath of that irri-</p><p>tation that held him in its grip in the deli- </p><p>cious cool of the evening, as they strolled </p><p>back from the concert in the Alameda, </p><p>when not even Diana’s face under a pale </p><p>blu&lt;’ rebosa could light his gloom. Nor </p><p>could the excellent supper the porters had </p><p>set out in the “Dianthe,” for he stood </p><p>moodily apart while the others ate, hinting </p><p>darkly of an early morning departure. A </p><p>crowd—some who had been listening to the </p><p>concert and others who had swelled the </p><p>number—came swarming down to the sta- </p><p>tion, singing and shouting, and halted near </p><p>the car. </p><p> “I wonder if our friends are merely out</p><p>for the air, or if this is a rally?’’said Chase. </p><p>“Looks rather promising.” </p><p> The crowd swayed nearer, gesticulating</p><p>268 </p><p>Adventur-e </p><p>and pointing to the windows of the “Di- </p><p>an the.’' </p><p> “Oh, please,” cried the younger Miss</p><p>Levering timidly, “mayn’t we have the </p><p>shades down?” </p><p> “I see no reason why,” said Gelbhauser</p><p>sourly. </p><p> “Isn’t it just possible,” said Diana dryly,</p><p>“that the sight of us at our fifth meal may </p><p>be a little irritating to people who may </p><p>have difficulty in getting two?” </p><p> His heavy face flushed unpleasantly.</p><p>“You’ve become inoculated with British- </p><p>Mexican Socialism, I see, but I shall pay </p><p>no attention to them. It is not our affair </p><p>if they choose the vicinity of our car for </p><p>their meeting.” </p><p> “Revolution, run away, Come again some</p><p>other day, Little Hermie wants to play!” </p><p>chanted Tommy softly, and the Misses </p><p>Levering giggled nervously. Gelbhauser, </p><p>who had caught the drift, wheeled on the </p><p>boy with his face stormy, but a stone </p><p>whizzed through the window, grazing his </p><p>cheek and just breaking the skin. </p><p> “That settles it!” he shouted, running</p><p>into his state-room, while a pocket edition </p><p>of pandemonium reigned in the car, and re- </p><p>turning with his revolver. </p><p> “Gelbhauser, are you crazy?” cried</p><p>Chase, springing at him. “What-” </p><p> “I’ll show you!” he screamed furiously.</p><p>“I’ll show you how to deal with these cat- </p><p>tle!” Shaking off the restraining hand he </p><p>fired into the crowd. There was a cry of </p><p>rage and pain, and then all that had gone </p><p>before in the way of noise became as the </p><p>calm of a Summer day—shrieks, curses, a </p><p>fusillade of stones, a knife which gleamed </p><p>past Diana and imbedded itself in the wall. </p><p> Chase and Tommy sprang to the doors,</p><p>calling to the rest to pull the shades, and </p><p>the members of the “Dianthe’s” party </p><p>looked at each other in pallid silence while </p><p>the menacing roar grew louder. Then, sud- </p><p>denly, a new note was added to the tumult </p><p>—a shout which sent the color flooding </p><p>back into Miss Millard’s whitte face. “I </p><p>knew he would come for us!” she said, with </p><p>a little laugh, and Tommy threw open the </p><p>door to admit Blythe-Masterson, breath- </p><p>less and imperative. </p><p> “Quick!” he gasped. “You’ll have to</p><p>run for it! I heard they were meeting, and </p><p>hurried to-” He looked at the pistol </p><p>in Gelbhauser’s limp hand. “You had the </p><p>bad luck to wing Florenzio—the vision- </p><p>chap, and there’s the deuce- to pay! Get </p><p>the women out of the window on-that side—, </p><p>it’s dark—Romaldo’s there—he’ll take you </p><p>to the hacienda! Quick, I say! I'll stand </p><p>them off here till you get a bit of a start!” </p><p>Tommy and Chase had flown to obey </p><p>him as he spoke, but Herman, Jr., brand-. </p><p>ished his pistol hysterically. “Am I to ' </p><p>abandon my car to these savages? ” </p><p> “Man alive!” shouted the Englishman,</p><p>“I’ll do my best to save your car, but I-’pi </p><p>trying to save your skin! Quick, I tell yoyl- ’• </p><p>He opened the door and shouted something </p><p>in Spanish to the mob, then slammed it </p><p>again and ran to Tommy and caught-his: </p><p>arm. “I say, you’ll look after her?” V - </p><p>“Bet your neck!” said the boy- briefly, </p><p>and Blythe-Masterson went out on the-plat- </p><p>form and shut the door behind him. </p><p>THE elegant Romaldo was-receiv- </p><p>ing the limp and terrified ladies </p><p>from the arms of Tommy ari.d </p><p>Chase, and when they were all on thfe </p><p>ground he pointed to the left, motioned for </p><p>silence, and set off through th.e /lark at a </p><p>run, the Americans stumbling after him. </p><p>Diana had been the last to be lifted down, </p><p>and she clutched Tommy’s hand and'hung. </p><p>back. </p><p> “What will they do to him?” she whis-</p><p>pered fiercely. “We can’t-” </p><p> “Come along!” said Tommy impor-</p><p>tantly. “He told me to take care of you!” </p><p>Diana stood still. “Tommy, did he, hon- </p><p>estly? When? What did he say?” </p><p> “Come on!” panted the boy, pulling her.</p><p>“Do you think this is a pink tea? Hurry!” </p><p>From the other side of the car they could </p><p>hear the Englishman’s voice in earnest ex- </p><p>postulation, and the yells and hisses of the </p><p>crowd. </p><p> “Tommy, they’ll kill him! We can't</p><p>leave-” </p><p> “Now you’ve done it! They’re coming</p><p>round! Pull that thing over your face. </p><p>Sh! Back into the shadow!” </p><p> A section of the crowd swayed round the</p><p>end of the car, and Tommy dragged Mise </p><p>Millard deeper into the shade, creeping be- </p><p>side the car to the end of it, then stumbling </p><p>and pushing through the friendly dark, </p><p>jostled by the mob, which was* breaking </p><p>and surging to all sides. They made' a </p><p>spurt to a freight-car, and leaned against</p><p>it, gasping.	.</p><p> “Sh!” broathfd Tommy;, "'“If anybody</p><p>Enter, the Hero </p><p>269 </p><p> comes near, say something Spanish—any-</p><p> thing!”</p><p> “I c-can’t think of anything but the soap,</p><p> •	or the silk handkerchief of the French-</p><p> man ! ” she whispered wildly. “ Oh, Tommy,</p><p> they’re coming this way!”</p><p> They ran on again, Tommy pulling and</p><p> urging. “Run! Run! Didn’t you ever</p><p> play basket-ball? Didn’t you ever play</p><p> tag? Faster!”</p><p> On through the soft, murky darkness,</p><p> away from the station and the lights, till</p><p> the sound of the voices grew faint and died</p><p> away, and Miss Millard sank down in re-</p><p> bellion. “Not—another—inch—Tommy!</p><p> Oh, if I ever—breathe again!”</p><p> “And now we’re lost, like the Babes in</p><p> the Wood,” sat'd Tommy.</p><p> “■■Never mind,’'’ said Diana, breathless</p><p> but serene, “he’ll come for us! He’ll find</p><p> 'us!*’</p><p> Tommy found breath to whistle “Rule</p><p> Brittania;” and he whistled it again, an</p><p> hour later, when he heard a galloping horse.</p><p> “My word, I’m glad to find you! I’ve</p><p> been scouring the jungle!” The English-</p><p> man had flung himself off and was holding</p><p> both Miss Millard’s hands. “You’re safe?</p><p> You’re quite sure you’re not hurt?” Then</p><p> reproachfully, to Tommy, “You promised</p><p> ras you’d look after her!”</p><p> “Well, she-” began the boy, but a</p><p> frantic cough from Diana checked him.</p><p> “We were slow in getting started, and the</p><p> mob cut us off from the rest. Then we</p><p> beat it—my friend, Miss Diana of the</p><p> chase, and me, and-”</p><p> “You shall ride my horse,” Blythe-Mas-</p><p> terson said to Miss Millard, “and Jerrolds</p><p> and I will walk beside you. I didn’t want</p><p> to alarm the others when I saw you were</p><p> not with them at the hacienda, and I told</p><p> them you were safe at the hotel, so they</p><p> haven’t been worrying.”</p><p> They set off through the velvet blackness</p><p> of the night, Tommy limping wearily and</p><p> considerately in the rear, and Romaldo met</p><p> them at the gate of Las Golondrinas.</p><p> “Senor,” he said, “I am your Honor’s</p><p> servant who kisses your hands, and your</p><p> guests are all sleeping, save only the fat</p><p> senor, who wails for his car.”</p><p> Diana wtis given a steamer chair in the</p><p> ksgrjtat'patio, and the wife of Romaldo</p><p> surirfffQiiecf to attend her. She was also, it</p><p>-	qjfpeargd,-. tfie senor’s servant who kissed</p><p> his hands,* pnd *he .chfef of-her joys was ris-</p><p> ing at one o’clock to prepare chocolate</p><p> for beautiful and famished young ladies.</p><p> After that she showed Miss Millard to</p><p> her room.</p><p> ft AND it seemed hardly an hour after</p><p>-jigPv- her soft “Buenos noches” that she </p><p>was saying “Buenos dias” beside </p><p>the bed, with another cup of steaming </p><p>chocolate. Diana hurried down to the </p><p>patio, and found the “Dianthe’s” party </p><p>assembled, weary-eyed and much subdued. </p><p> “It seems beastly inhospitable to speed</p><p>your going this way,” said their host un- </p><p>happily, “but I know you’ll feel more com- </p><p>fortable when you’ve put a good bit of </p><p>country between you and your adventures </p><p>of last night. I got them to take your car </p><p>down to Vera Cruz on the midnight freight. </p><p>Romaldo will drive you to Atoyac, where </p><p>you’ll catch the train. I—I’m no end sorry </p><p>to hurry you.” He led the way to the gate, </p><p>where the four-horse stage and three sad- </p><p>dle-horses were waiting, and helped the </p><p>women in. </p><p> Diana, dazed and wondering, leaned</p><p>down to speak to him. “You—you are </p><p>coming with us? ” </p><p> “Unfortunately, no. I—er—I have</p><p>things to look after here—things to be at- </p><p>tended to at once. It’s beastly luck, but I </p><p>can’t possibly leave the ranch this morning. </p><p>Romaldo, one moment!” </p><p> Miss Millard, watching in utter bewilder-</p><p>ment, saw him slip a folded paper into the </p><p>Mexican’s hand and whisper to him earn- </p><p>estly. Then Romaldo leaped to the driver’s </p><p>seat, cracked his long whip, and they were </p><p>off in a cloud of golden dust. </p><p> Young Tommy’s hand found hers undei</p><p>the robe as he ran his horse close beside </p><p>when they slowed down for a turn. “I </p><p>don’t know how,” he whispered, “but </p><p>Hermie did it! He was with him half an </p><p>hour, before the rest came down, and— </p><p>you saw Blythe-Masterson’s face! Shall I </p><p>slay Hermie at once or reserve him for </p><p>torture?” </p><p> She pulled her thick veil down over her</p><p>face and leaned back in the corner of the </p><p>seat in silence, careless of the close-clipped </p><p>smiles of the Levering girls and the hard </p><p>fun in Chase’s eyes. Five little days, then, </p><p>was to be the sum of it all! The “ Dianthe ” </p><p>was waiting; Herman, Jr., was waiting; </p><p>life, as she had known it, was waiting. A</p><p>brisk, fresh wind had swept through the </p><p>270 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> ^lot-kouse, revealing it, cleansing it, but</p><p> the door was shut now, and the air was</p><p> danker than ever—spent, stale, heavy with</p><p> •	forced blooms.</p><p> Gelbhauser, thudding solidly on his slim</p><p>. moflnt, reined in beside her, a chastened </p><p>diear«on his wide face. “All’s well that </p><p>ends*well, eh, Miss Millard? I’m sorry I </p><p>was so upset last night. I hope I don’t have </p><p>to^jxplain to you that it wasn’t the broken </p><p>window. It was the principle of the thing. </p><p>.

The revered emploj'er </p><p>also read two times and three. </p><p>—but I am not, not, NOT engaged to him, and </p><p>I never— </p><p>“Senor,” said Romaldo, politely and </p><p>patiently, “I am your Honor’^ servant </p><p>who-” </p><p>“Saddles my horse!” cried his master, </p><p>“And gets a month’s wages if I make the </p><p>two-ten for Vera Cruz!” </p><p>the fight of </p><p>PATSY M9GLYNN </p><p>BY EDWARD ALEXANDER PHILLIPS </p><p> IS A STEP sounded at the street</p><p>door the Widow McGlynn glanced </p><p>significantly at her daughter, and </p><p>the two, as though acting upon a </p><p>signal, jerked the comers of their aprons to </p><p>£heir moist eyes and assumed an air of </p><p>cheerfulness. But rapid as the change had </p><p>been, it did not escape the quick eye of the </p><p>powerfully built young man who suddenly </p><p>appeared in the doorway and now sent his </p><p>searching, half-accusing gaze from one to</p><p>the other. </p><p> “Crying again, eh?” he challenged, more</p><p>in deprecation of a foolish habit than in </p><p>unkindness toward those who indulged it. </p><p>“Well. I suppose it does women-folks good- </p><p>The Fight of Patsy McGlynn </p><p>271 </p><p>I’ve heard so. But you mustn’t cry any more </p><p>to-night, mother. See what I’ve brought </p><p>you—a brand new five-dollar gold-piece!” </p><p> Thfc widow took the coin, slipped it in her</p><p>.bosom and disappeared from mortal sight </p><p>into the yawning chasm formed by her big </p><p>boy’s outstretched arms and expansive </p><p>cliest. Held thus for a full minute in total </p><p>eclipse, the world must ever remain in </p><p>ignorance as to how she would have inter- </p><p>preted the series of astonishing facial con- </p><p>tortions with which the young giant now </p><p>favored his staring sister. Nor was that </p><p>rattled young woman herself able to guess </p><p>what was intended to be conveyed to her by </p><p>the volley of cumbrous winks, smirks and </p><p>grins whjck came her way. There was </p><p>something so ridiculous in the pantomime, </p><p>with its impromptu setting, that she laughed </p><p>outright—and was sorry in a second, as a </p><p>fierce frown of disapproval darkened her </p><p>brother’s face. In apparent disgust at her </p><p>dullness, he jerked his head toward the door </p><p>by which he had just entered and—released </p><p>his prisoner. </p><p> “ Patsy, you’re a regular old grizzly bear! ”</p><p> gasped the smiling old mother, now re-</p><p> stored to the best of humor. ‘‘You nearly</p><p> smothered me, so you did; you’re that</p><p> strong 1 Where’s Annie?”</p><p> “Stepped across to the Morrissy’s—back</p><p>in a minute. And while you’re fixing us a </p><p>bite to eat, mother, I’ll drop down to the </p><p>corner and see if there is any news from the </p><p>factory.” </p><p> A few minutes before filled with appre-</p><p>hension of the calamity she felt must speed- </p><p>ily come upon the little family, the widow </p><p>now moved with sprightly step about the </p><p>narrow kitchen, humming an air to the ac- </p><p>companying rattle of pots and pans—an air </p><p>that came faith-full and hope-laden from the </p><p>heart and dissipated every fear. Such are </p><p>mothers of big boys. </p><p> To be sure the boiler-factory had been</p><p>closed for months, keeping Patsy out of </p><p>work. The coal-man was importunate. </p><p>The grocer refused further supplies. The </p><p>rent-collector had threatened to put them </p><p>out. For the past few weeks Patsy had </p><p>earned varying sums at some training-</p><p>quarters across the Bay, where he had </p><p>assisted in preparing certain athletes for </p><p>certain conjing contests—she didn’t know </p><p>what. She only hoped he was not mixing </p><p>up with prize-fights and those terrible prize- </p><p>fighters. Anything but that! </p><p> Her son’s small and irregular earnings had</p><p>been far from adequate. Troubles seemed </p><p>to be coming from every direction, threaten- </p><p>ing to culminate all at once. During the long </p><p>day, when her son was away, she simply </p><p>could not avoid the dreadful picture of </p><p>hurrying disaster. Human reason refused </p><p>to justify any hope of escape. There was fio </p><p>avoiding the inevitable. How was it that, </p><p>in face of the coming calamity, Patsy man- </p><p>aged to remain cheerful? She couldn’t </p><p>understand it; yet she was forced to admit </p><p>that it was no more strange than the regular </p><p>disappearance of her own fearful apprehen- </p><p>sions when night brought him rollicking </p><p>home and stood him there in the center of </p><p>the little sitting-room, his great arms spread </p><p>out, like the wings of some gigantic bat, in- </p><p>viting her to the enjoyment of her regular </p><p>evening “smother.” </p><p> But even the training-club employment</p><p>was now at an end. Patsy had said so him- </p><p>self when he gave her that five-dollar piece, </p><p>bidding her make the most of it. Matters </p><p>were thus worse than ever. Still she hummed </p><p>that air. Fear had flown. Hope was in </p><p>her heart. Why? </p><p>“NOW, you look here, Sis,” com- </p><p>manded Patsy McGlynn, towering </p><p>over his sister Annie in the half- </p><p>light of the areaway before their little flat, </p><p>“You look here!” </p><p> “I’m looking,” said the girl, squaring</p><p>herself in mock belligerency. </p><p> “I want advice,” he announced curtly.</p><p> “Well, sir, you’ve come to the right shop.</p><p>What seems to be the nature of your </p><p>trouble? ” </p><p> “No josh—this is serious. I want ad-</p><p>vice, but it has to be advice with a siring </p><p>to it.” </p><p> “Advice with a strin—what do you</p><p>mean?” </p><p> “I mean I want you to give me the</p><p>advice I tell you to give me. Are you </p><p>game? ” </p><p> “Game? You know I’m game. State</p><p>your case.” </p><p> “It’s like this. You know that fellow</p><p>Mike Doolan I’ve been training for the </p><p>heavyweight fight Friday night? Well, he’s </p><p>supposed to be the hardest proposition the</p><p>Coast has ever turned out. They had to go </p><p>to Australia to get a man to lick him—Jack </p><p>Farnum. Even at that, the betting is ten </p><p>to seven, with Doolan the favorite, which </p><p>2? 2 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>shows how the ‘insiders' feel about it. </p><p>Now, you listen to what I’m saying, for I </p><p>wouldn’t say it to any one else on earth— </p><p>without your advice. </p><p> Doolan first hired me to wrestle with</p><p> him, because I’m husky and heavy and he</p><p> nSeSed a lot of hauling about to prepare him</p><p> for work in the clinches. He got all the</p><p> jiauling he wanted, all right. Well, the</p><p> fhird day after I began work one of his</p><p> sparring partners failed to show up and 1</p><p> t Was asked to spar with him for four rounds.</p><p> At the end of the bout he called me into his</p><p> dressing-room and offered me the job of</p><p> boxing with him at odd times up to the date</p><p> of the fight. He said, though I was young,</p><p> I had speed and, as that was the main thing</p><p> he had to overcome in Farnum, I was just</p><p> the kid he needed to make him extend him-</p><p> self. He didn’t want me to do any leading,</p><p> he said—only to block his leads and counter</p><p> lightly when I saw an opening.</p><p> “Look at me, Sis. I hadn’t boxed with</p><p> that fellow three times before I knew I could</p><p> hit him when and where I pleased! More</p><p> than that, I knew I was faster, could hit</p><p> harder and that he couldn’t put a glove on</p><p> me in a week, if I didn’t want him to. And</p><p> here’s another thing—a couple of ’em: I</p><p> knew that he knew I was at least his equal</p><p> at all points of the game, and I knew that he</p><p> knew that 1 knew it. Follow me?</p><p> “Now, make a note of this: I never did</p><p> extend myself boxing with Doolan. Mother</p><p> needed that five-spot the‘great heavyweight’</p><p> was paying me for each set-to, and I</p><p> couldn’t afford to lose the job. So, while he</p><p> couldn’t have helped knowing I was as good</p><p> at the game as he was, he didn’t know whai</p><p> an easy mark he’d be for me if it came to</p><p> a real ‘go.’</p><p> “Now, I’ve not told any one these things.</p><p> It would sound like boasting, and I’ve no</p><p> ambition to be a fighter. Only you and I</p><p> are ‘wise,’ for, though a good many wit-</p><p> nessed our bouts, I carefully followed my</p><p> boss’s instructions, working always on the</p><p> defensive and keeping the sting out of my</p><p> leads, counters and swings.</p><p> “We boxed the last bout this afternoon,</p><p> and, when we got through, Doolan took me</p><p> into his private room and offered me $250</p><p> to second him at Friday night’s fight, I told</p><p> him how mother and you feel about prize-</p><p> fighting, but he said he could arrange it so</p><p>I	could serve under an assumed name</p><p>That $250 looked mighty juicy, the way </p><p> things are with us, Sis, and I finally agreed</p><p> to act as Doolan’s second.</p><p> “Then something happened that just</p><p>about knocked me dean silly. What do </p><p>you suppose that alleged sport told me? </p><p>That Friday night’s fight was fixed! Sure— </p><p>a fake! Doolan was to foul Farnum in the </p><p>eighth round, and I was to admit the claim </p><p>when Famum’s second made it. That’s as </p><p>far as he got with my instructions when a </p><p>gang of newspaper men and others broke </p><p>into the room and my boss shook me by the </p><p>hand and said we’d go further into the </p><p>details to-morrow. So you see, Sis, this </p><p>brace of pug highwaymen propose on nexl </p><p>Friday night to steal between thirty thou- </p><p>sand and forty thousand dollars from the. </p><p>Califrisco Club, which is promoting the </p><p>contest, and the public, which is always </p><p>ready to encourage legitimate sport with </p><p>its good hard money. And your fair- </p><p>haired brother is supposed to |be in with </p><p>the robbery! What do you think of it?” </p><p> “I think it’s a shame and a scand-”</p><p> “Hold! Here’s where I test your game-</p><p>ness. You know I’d rather have my head </p><p>cut off than betray the confidence of a </p><p>decent man, don’t you?” </p><p> “Certainly I know it.”</p><p> “Well, this is the first time I’ve been</p><p>honored with the confidence of a thieving </p><p>scrub, I want you to advise me to go to </p><p>Mr. Fulmer, president of the club, and </p><p>explain the whole situation.” </p><p> “That’s easy. I advise it.”</p><p> “And, after that, I want you to advise</p><p>me to do what I think best for all con- </p><p>cerned.” </p><p> “But, what--”</p><p> “No ‘buts.’ Be game! I want you to</p><p>advise it.” </p><p> “Well—er—g-go ahead.”</p><p> “Good. Now, you wouldn’t throw a</p><p>man down for doing what you advise him to </p><p>do, would you? ” </p><p> “Why, no—that is—certainly not.”</p><p>“Then, when I get through doing what </p><p>you have advised me to do, I want </p><p>you to stand up, like a thoroughbred, </p><p>and tell mother that I did it at your </p><p>suggestion.” </p><p> “But—you—you-”</p><p> “Are you a quitter?”</p><p> “N-no-but I-”</p><p> “Be game, Sis!

Mother’s waiting.</p><p>The Fight of Patsy McGlynn </p><p>273 </p><p>II </p><p>PATSY McGLYNN stepped from </p><p>the side door of President Fulmer’s </p><p>residence and hurried down the </p><p>street. Three blocks away he slackened his </p><p>pace and walked leisurely in the direction of </p><p>the ferry. “I don’t want to get over there </p><p>ahead of the old man,” he said, “so I’ll </p><p>mosey along, easy like.” </p><p> It was mid-afternoon when the young</p><p>athlete sauntered up to the training-quar- </p><p>ters. A big crowd was about the place and </p><p>the sports, reporters, photographers and </p><p>others, who had come to see the noted heavy- </p><p>weight don the gloves for the last time be- </p><p>fore the great fight, were voicing their dis- </p><p>appointment at Doolan’s announcement </p><p>that he would box no more until he faced </p><p>Farnum in the ring, two days hence. Acci- </p><p>dents, he had explained, were likely to hap- </p><p>pen. He might injure his hands, or strain </p><p>a tendon. The event was the most impor- </p><p>tant in his career and he couldn’t afford to </p><p>take chances. He was in perfect condition </p><p>for the fight of his life. His friends and </p><p>backers would have to excuse him. </p><p> The disgusted visitors growled and moved</p><p>away to catch their train back to the city. </p><p>Only a few remained, and of this number </p><p>Patsy noticed, without surprise, President </p><p>Fulmer, the treasurer and two of the club </p><p>directors. They were talking to Doolan </p><p>who, now appearing for the first time to </p><p>notice the presence of his late sparring part- </p><p>ner, called him up and introduced him to the </p><p>distinguished visitors. Patsy was glad to </p><p>meet the gentlemen, especially the famous </p><p>Mr. Fulmer, of whom he had heard so much </p><p>—though he had pictured him a much older </p><p>man, he said. </p><p> “ I got that crowd out of the way on pur-</p><p>pose,” explained the pugilist. “ These gentle- </p><p>men want to see me in action. Get your </p><p>ring clothes on, Patsy. We’ll box four </p><p>rounds for ’em. It’s only a-” </p><p> “I’ll tell you what we want, McGlynn,"</p><p>broke in the pompous president, taking mat- </p><p>ters into his own hands. “We want to see </p><p>some real glove-work—something fast and </p><p>furious. Of course you’re liable to get </p><p>battered up some, but you’re no doubt used </p><p>to that. Here’s ten dollars to buy salve for</p><p>the bruises that are waiting for you, and,” </p><p>he rattled on, “ to encourage you to do your </p><p>best, we four spectators will each give you </p><p>another ten dollars if you succeed in knock- </p><p>ing this big fellow out.” All hands joined </p><p>in the laughter which greeted this announce- </p><p>ment from the great sporting promoter, and </p><p>Patsy thieved a knowing glance at him asie </p><p>started for his dressing-room, muttering, </p><p>“Four t’ms ten’s forty, and one’s fifty- </p><p>mother’11 have a fit!”	• *</p><p>* ' </p><p>BjW PUGILIST and pupil sat in opposite </p><p>imu! corners °f ^e training-ring, antf </p><p>President Fulmer, watch in hand, </p><p>squeezed through the ropes and addressed </p><p>“the audience.” </p><p> “Gentlemen,” he said, “I am running</p><p>this show, and I hope that fact will be a </p><p>sufficient guarantee that it is on the square. </p><p>At the first sign of faking on the part of </p><p>either of these principals the contest will be </p><p>declared off and there will be things doing </p><p>which are not down on the bill.” </p><p> Doolan laughed at this “little joke,”</p><p>though, to tell the truth, that laugh of his </p><p>did not add materially to the sum total of </p><p>the world’s supply of mirth. There was a </p><p>note of seriousness in Fulmer’s speech and </p><p>manner which was not to be mistaken. As </p><p>for Patsy, he was kept busy during the </p><p>president’s remarks, in two directions—the </p><p>sustained simulation of absorbing interest </p><p>in official instructions, and the avoidance </p><p>of a series of desperately winked signals </p><p>from Doolan’s corner. </p><p> As Fulmer proceeded, with increased em-</p><p>phasis, to picture the dire things in store for </p><p>the first man who showed signs of faking, </p><p>the bearing of the big professional, now </p><p>plainly disgusted at Patsy’s gaping dullness, </p><p>was observed to undergo a sudden change. </p><p>A new idea seemed all at once to possess </p><p>him. He ceased to smile. His face became </p><p>set. He glared at the man in the center of </p><p>the ring, at the young athlete in the oppo- </p><p>sit corner, and jammed the thin layer of </p><p>padding back from that part of the glove </p><p>which covered his right knuckles. Patsy </p><p>observed all this. He knew what it meant. </p><p>Though making no outward sign, he smiled </p><p>—smiled, as the late lamented Bill Nye would </p><p>have said—elsewhere. </p><p> “Time!” called the self-appointed referee.</p><p>“Shake hands!” </p><p> Doolan, jaws set, eyes a-gleam, moved</p><p>warily to the center of the ring. Patsy, with </p><p>right hand extended, stepped lithely for-</p><p>ward to meet him. Doolan drew close to </p><p>the young fellow and, instead of grasping </p><p>the proffered glove with his right hand, he </p><p>274 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>threw the weight of his left upon it and, </p><p>before- McGlynn could divine his purpose, </p><p>hjs mighty right whizzed through the open- </p><p>ing, caught Patsy flush in the face and sent </p><p>him reeling against the ringpost across the </p><p>enclosure, limp and dazed. </p><p> ' Doolan bounded across the ring to finish</p><p> Ins' work before the victim of his treachery</p><p> could recover from the shock, but Fulmer</p><p> sprang in front of him and waved him back</p><p> The three spectators were on their feet</p><p> ^yelling, “Foul!” “Shame!” But the an-</p><p> *gry referee commanded silence and, stand-</p><p> ing between the boxers, ordered Doolan to</p><p> hi? corner. The slight delay gave McGlynn</p><p> £n opportunity to collect his scattered</p><p> senses and, after giving his head a shake or</p><p> two, he was himself again, except for a</p><p> rapidly swelling lump under the left eye.</p><p> Fulmer started to make another speech,</p><p> hesitated, bit his lip, glared from one to the</p><p> other of the boxers, and then, stepping over</p><p> to McGlynn, asked, “Do you want this</p><p> contest to proceed?"</p><p> “Certainly,” answered the young fellow</p><p> cheerily, “I’m good as new.”</p><p> “Then we’ll make that read twenty, in-</p><p> stead of ten, from each spectator, if you</p><p> knock him out,” whispered Fulmer in his</p><p> ear.</p><p> “Thanks.’’ And, gazing across the ring</p><p> at the scowling Doolan, he muttered, “ Four</p><p> fc’ms twenty’s eighty, and ten’s ninety'—</p><p> mother’ll have two fits!”</p><p> “Time!”</p><p> Patsy stepped to the center, and waited.</p><p> Doolan took a couple of strides from his</p><p> comer, and stopped. The youngster, mov-</p><p> ing like a cat, lessened the distance between</p><p> them by a yard—another foot—another.</p><p> At all but reaching distance they faced each</p><p> other, standing like graven images, motion-</p><p> less, each waiting for the other to lead. A</p><p> full minute of this tense inaction, then a</p><p> quick feint caused the veteran to drop his</p><p> left hand—an inch. It was enough. Across</p><p> the lowered guard flashed the fist of the</p><p> hard-hitting novice. It found a target at</p><p> the point of the jaw and—the lights went</p><p> out for Mr. Doolan!</p><p> Ten minutes later the “ Pride of the Coast’ ’</p><p> came out of his trance and propounded</p><p> the usual question. He was informed that</p><p> he was on the floor of the shower-bath room,</p><p> having been carried there by Patsy McGlynn</p><p> and three attendants; that he had met with</p><p> an accident while boxing; that he was the</p><p> victim of a compound fracture of the jaw,</p><p> that he was shy sundry molars, incisors and</p><p> bicuspids; that President Fulmer was wait-</p><p> ing to see him.</p><p> As soon as he could be made presentable,</p><p>Mr. Doolan went into executive session with </p><p>Fulmer and his directors. Patsy McGlynn </p><p>was also present. It was not a long session, </p><p>Mr. Doolan falling readily into the views </p><p>expressed by the president of the Califrisco </p><p>Club and his fellow officers. The Club, </p><p>through its representatives, expressed poign- </p><p>ant regret, yea, pangs of pain, at the mis- </p><p>hap which would prevent Mr. Doolan’s </p><p>appearance at the coming fistic entertain- </p><p>ment; and, with panting interest for his </p><p>future welfare, pointed out the benefits of </p><p>continuous travel beyond the limits of the </p><p>State. Mr. Doolan, with fiis hand to his </p><p>jaw, nodded the thanks he could not find </p><p>words to express and—the session adjourned. </p><p>“I’M SURE I’ve tried to bear up </p><p>eg under the strain,” sighed the Widow </p><p>w McGlynn, “ but it doesn’t seem to do </p><p>any good. Matters become worse every day. </p><p>There is no hope anywhere. The rent-” </p><p> “What’s the matter with me?” cried</p><p>Patsy, bursting into the room like an ele- </p><p>phant rampant on its hind legs. “Ain’t 1 </p><p>a tolerable imitation of the hope you’re </p><p>talking about? Look me over—I’m a </p><p>billionaire!’1 </p><p> “Patsy, Patsy, how can you be so fool-</p><p>ish? The rent-man and the coal-man and </p><p>the grocer have been here again, and we’re </p><p>going to be put out next Monday morning! ” </p><p>“Well, this is only Wednesday night.” </p><p>“But how are we going to live? I paid </p><p>bills with that money you gave me last </p><p>night and we haven’t a cent. How can </p><p>we-’’ </p><p> “ Mother, look here. Did you ever know</p><p>anybody to win anything by being gloomy </p><p>and looking on the dark side of things?” </p><p> “Well, what is the use--”</p><p> “Did you?”</p><p> “I suppose not, but--"</p><p> “And haven’t you noticed that good</p><p>fortune always follows cheerfulness?” </p><p> “Not always.”</p><p> “Yes, always! Drawing a hand from his</p><p>pocket the incorrigible held it above his </p><p>mother’s head and, with the other taking </p><p>her gently but firmly by the chin, he com-</p><p>manded, “Now smile! Smile!” </p><p> Her son’s ridiculous attitude forced the</p><p>The Fight of Patsy McGlynn </p><p>275 </p><p>good woman to smile in spite of herself, and </p><p>instantly the massive hand above her head </p><p>opened and she was submerged under a </p><p>shower of greenbacks and coins. </p><p> “Patsy! Wh-where in the name of—</p><p>where did all this money come from? ” </p><p> “From that smile of yours, of course!”</p><p>teased the roaring Patsy. “Let it be a </p><p>lesson to you!” And while the happy </p><p>mother went into retirement against the </p><p>dancing heart of her big boy, Sister Annie </p><p>collected the scattered fortune with a broom. </p><p>in </p><p>THE Thursday morning papers an- </p><p>nounced under scare-heads that, </p><p>owing to an injury received while </p><p>training, the famous pugilist, Mike Doolan, </p><p>would be unable to meet the Australian </p><p>heavyweight, Jack Farnum, on Friday </p><p>night. Fortunately, however, the Cali- </p><p>frisco Club management had been able to </p><p>procure a substitute for the injured fighter— </p><p>an Unknown whom Farnum had agreed to </p><p>meet under conditions absolutely identical </p><p>with those arranged for his fight with the </p><p>Coast favorite. </p><p> These conditions called for a purse of</p><p>twenty thousand dollars, winner take all, </p><p>and a division of the gate-receipts on a basis </p><p>of seventy-five and twenty-five per cent, to </p><p>the winner and loser respectively. All bets </p><p>on the interrupted event had been declared </p><p>off and the first effect of the announcement </p><p>had been to make the Australian a big fa- </p><p>vorite over the Unknown, the “ wise ones ” </p><p>figuring that, barring Doolan, no heavy- </p><p>weight then on the Coast had a chance </p><p>against the foreigner. </p><p> Mr. Fulmer owned one of the finest pri-</p><p>vate gymnasiums in the city and it was </p><p>there that Patsy McGlynn spent all of </p><p>Thursday, perfecting himself in a few tricks </p><p>of “foot-work” and trying to demonstrate </p><p>to the personal friends of his patron that the </p><p>Club had been fully and entirely justified </p><p>in presenting him as a substitute for the </p><p>injured fighter. Of course it was impos- </p><p>sible to conceal the identity of the Unknown </p><p>from the newspaper men, but when the </p><p>young fellow frankly explained to them </p><p>his reasons for wishing to keep his name </p><p>out of the papers they patted him on the </p><p>back, promised him all possible protection </p><p>and wished him all kinds of success.</p><p>Next day the young athlete lounged about </p><p>home until late in the afternoon, keeping his </p><p>mother and sister in merry humor, and </p><p>explaining, with minute attention to every </p><p>horrible detail, the ghastly fate he had </p><p>planned for them if he ever again caught </p><p>them giving way to sad and gloomy </p><p>forebodings. </p><p> “The only way to make the bugbear of bad'</p><p>luck hike to the woods is to grin in his face,” </p><p>he said. “Laugh at him—that’s the dop*! </p><p>Now, I want you two to keep grinning till </p><p>I get back home. I’ll be a little late, maybe, </p><p>but you keep grinning. Start in right now * </p><p>—one—two—three—that’s it! Now keep </p><p>it up!” And he was gone. </p><p>“McGLYNN,” said Fulmer, “X </p><p>want a serious word with you. </p><p>I’ve got a big bunch of money </p><p>here, mostly my friends’, to be wagered at </p><p>the ringside. I don’t want to lose it.” </p><p>“Bet it on me, then, Mr. Fulmer, and get </p><p>it all placed before the first round is over.” </p><p>“But why are you so certain of success, </p><p>Patsy? This man Famum is a mighty tough </p><p>proposition. I want to know the grounds </p><p>for your confidence. Of course, I think you </p><p>have a fair chance; but why are you so </p><p>absolutely certain about it? ” </p><p> “Mr. Fulmer,” returned the young boxer,</p><p>in a tone of unusual seriousness, “I’m going </p><p>to win this fight because I think I’m going to! </p><p>You can do anything, if you think you can! ” </p><p>“There’s lots of glory in it, if you win.” </p><p>“I’m not looking for that brand of glory, </p><p>Mr. Fulmer. I’m after that big purse your </p><p>Club has hung up, and the long end of the </p><p>gate-receipts. I’m fighting to-night for— </p><p>for mother and Annie. It’ll be my first and </p><p>last prize-fight. And I’m going to win! So </p><p>get your money up early—the odds won’t be </p><p>so good after the first round.” </p><p> “ Well, go to it, my boy. I’ll take a chance</p><p>on you.” </p><p>BIG Jack Farnum shouldered his way </p><p>along the crowded aisle, mounted </p><p>the stage steps and squeezed his </p><p>bulky form between the ropes of the arena. </p><p>Seating himself in his comer, he sent his </p><p>gaze across to where the substitute and </p><p>attendants were busying themselves with </p><p>the glove-lacings. A sneer curled his lip. </p><p> “They tell me that’s the kid they had</p><p>sparring with Doolan,” he snarled in his </p><p>second’s ear. “They say he’s fast. Fast! </p><p>His speed’ll do ’im a-of a lot o’ good! </p><p>276 </p><p>Adventure</p><p>I s'pose tiie Club had to give some kind of </p><p>a sMvy and that amateur was the only thing </p><p>tl^cy could get to go agin me. Tighten up </p><p>that glove!” </p><p>. “Maybe you’d better lei the bout go a </p><p>few rounds, Jack,” wliisptred the second, </p><p>•’so’s to give the crowd a little bit of a run </p><p>Ter it’s money.” </p><p>, “Few rounds nothin'!” sneered the vet- </p><p>eran pug. “Do you think it 'Id do my </p><p>reputation any good to have that brat </p><p>boastin’ that he went any distance with me? </p><p>Not yet! When the gong strikes I s’pose </p><p>he’ll just stand in his corner an’ shiver. </p><p>I’ll walk over an’ clout him a couple o’ stiff </p><p>ones and—we’ll catch that midnight train </p><p>for Chicago!” </p><p> The principals and their seconds were</p><p>motioned to the center of the ring, where the </p><p>former shook hands and listened to the </p><p>referee’s interpretation of the rules. As the </p><p>two boxers stood there the backers of the </p><p>Australian could already hear their win- </p><p>nings jingling in their pockets. Their man </p><p>towered fully two inches above the substi- </p><p>tute fighter, and his great muscular shoul- </p><p>ders loomed formidably in comparison with </p><p>those of the younger man. What most of </p><p>■the enthusiasts in the audience failed to note </p><p>was that Patsy stood “hunched over” so </p><p>that he appeared a couple of inches shorter </p><p>chan he really was, and that the shuffling </p><p>awkwardness of his movements as he trav- </p><p>eled to and from the center of the ring was </p><p>a decidedly clever bit of acting. The ap- </p><p>pealing look which the young fellow bent </p><p>upon the professional was interpreted by </p><p>that amused gladiator as a bid for mercy. </p><p>So he was confirmed in his original deter- </p><p>mination to make short work of it. </p><p> The gong struck and big Jack Farnum</p><p>started across the ring on Ins mission of </p><p>mercy. He had negotiated the first half of </p><p>Ms second stride when something hit him. </p><p>It came from the opposite corner and bore </p><p>all the outward semblance of a human </p><p>thunderbolt. The audience saw it streak </p><p>Like a comet across the intervening space, </p><p>collide with the giant and send him stagger- </p><p>ing to his corner. Then; as the rope, </p><p>tightened by his weight, hurled him back, he </p><p>was met by a blinding hail of fists which </p><p>pelted his rocking head and face unmerci- </p><p>fully. Giving him no time to recover, the </p><p>furious Patsy drove him with slashing </p><p>uppercuts and body-smashes along the side </p><p>rope to the corner-post, where he brought </p><p>up, bloody and blinded by the battery of-</p><p>blows, limp and helpless. </p><p> The crowd went wild. The referee pushed.</p><p>Patsy toward the center of the ring and </p><p>stood over the gasping gladiator, counting </p><p>—one—two—three—four- </p><p> “Get up!” yelled the Australian’s second.</p><p>Five—six—seveD—eight- </p><p> “Get up!”</p><p> Farnum let go the ropes and reeled like a</p><p>drunken man into the ring. His hands hung </p><p>at his sides. He leered about him, foolishly. </p><p> “Finish him, McGlynn!” ordered the</p><p>referee. </p><p> “Hit a man like that? Why, sir, I</p><p>couldn’t-” </p><p> “Finish him, I tell you! The rules de-</p><p>mand it.” </p><p> “Rules, or no rules, I can’t, and I won’t! ”</p><p> “Put up your hands, Farnum. Put up</p><p>your hands and fight!” commanded the </p><p>official. </p><p> The veteran, slightly recovered, very</p><p>slowly raised his fists and threw himself into </p><p>a fighting attitude. Patsy measured the </p><p>distance accurately, estimated the necessary </p><p>force, and then—a feint, a short-arm jolt, </p><p>and the pride of Kangaroo-land toppled over </p><p>and took the count. </p><p> In handing Farnum the loser’s end of Use</p><p>gate-receipts, the head of the Califrisco Club </p><p>felt called upon to make a few remarks. </p><p> “It’s the first dollar jl have ever parted</p><p>with grudgingly,” he said. “I learned all </p><p>about that scheme you and Doolan faked up </p><p>to rob the Club and the public. I want to </p><p>say to you and, through you to your partner </p><p>Mike Doolan, that my regret at having to </p><p>give you this money is more than counter- </p><p>balanced by the delight it has given me to </p><p>see an unknown boy lick the stuffing out of </p><p>both of you! Good-by. Mister Farnum! ” </p><p>“NOW, Sis, while I’m getting my </p><p>factor}' ready for business and fix- </p><p>ing up our new home, I want you </p><p>and mother to go over and give the swells </p><p>and belles of Europe a treat. And when </p><p>you get her off in some dark corner, </p><p>away from all lines of communication, I </p><p>want you to stand up, like a thoroughbred, </p><p>and confess how you advised me to become </p><p>a prize-fighter!” </p><p> “Oh, Patsy, I can never do that!"</p><p> “You can do anything you think you</p><p>can! ” he said- </p><p>ADVENTURING IN TIBURON </p><p>A PERSONAL NARRATIVE Of EXCITING WEEKS IN THE </p><p>GULF OF CALIFORNIA Gy JOHN A AVIRETTE e &lt;9 &amp; &lt;* * </p><p> |HE two Burke boys, Charlie Kan-</p><p>aka, and I sat in close consulta- </p><p>tion. Great deference was given to </p><p>Charlie by the rest of us, since the </p><p>.natter under discussion was a boat. Was </p><p>he not a Salt of the Sea from the Pacific </p><p>Islands, where men swam out, in amphibious </p><p>temerity, to slay the terrible man-eater </p><p>shark in his own element? </p><p> Charlie finally said that She must be</p><p>twenty-two feet long, half-decked, and with </p><p>at least five feet beam. We should steal a </p><p>rail from the Southern Pacific R. R., bend </p><p>it] to suit and bolt it firmly to her bottom, </p><p>for a keel. This, he said, would stiffen </p><p>her, 'give her low ballast and, if we struck a </p><p>sunken rock in a blow, would save her </p><p>from holing. Thus, in lieu of sinking, we </p><p>should only turn over, </p><p> Charlie had his way. We built the boat,</p><p>half-decked her, stole the rail from Collis P., </p><p>and one glorious November morning chris- </p><p>tened her (with a bottle) Santa Maria. </p><p>Never had boat a more propitious launching, </p><p>and never had crew a fairer promise of fun </p><p>galore—for were we not bound for the mouth </p><p>of the Colorado River, Lower California and </p><p>Tiburon Island? And, where, pray, was a </p><p>wilder or more dangerous coast on which to </p><p>venture to one’s heart’s content? </p><p> Frank was the elder of the two Burkes.</p><p>He had six notches on his gun, while Pete, </p><p>as a modest younger brother, had only four </p><p>I had killed bear and deer, while Charlie had </p><p>once licked a French cook.

We camped on an </p><p>island, to minimize the mosquitoes, and </p><p>while the rest cooked supper I took the skiff </p><p>and pulled for Sonora and pork. I got the </p><p>pork. I came near getting too much pork, </p><p>for when I shot the pig he squealed. About </p><p>twenty great wild hogs responded to his cry </p><p>of distress and, bounding out of the tule, </p><p>rushed at me in fierce wrath. I stood not </p><p>on the order of my going; we made it in one </p><p>heat to the river bank, whence I dived head- </p><p>277 </p><p>278 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>long into the muddy waters of the Colorado. </p><p>Whpi? things had cooled off, I sneaked care- </p><p>fully back for my rifle and the pig. To those </p><p>wjjp know humanity, it is needless to state </p><p>that my arrival at camp was the signal for </p><p>' merciless jeers, mollified somewhat when I </p><p>produced the pig. </p><p> Nov. 13—To-day we are camped at Ship-</p><p> yard Slough. Some two hours after our</p><p> arrival we saw the famous “iide-rip” run in</p><p> from the Gulf. A wall of roaring water,</p><p>•	at least thirty feet high, rushed into the</p><p> mouth of the river at express-train speed.</p><p> I lelt much awe at the sight, for many</p><p> deaths have occurred at this point, when</p><p> ftither greenhorns or careless folk have been</p><p> caught in the fierce tide. Luckily, Charlie</p><p> knows all about this coast, so we were hauled</p><p> up high and dry, out of all danger. This</p><p> tide is at its greatest at new-moon or full-</p><p> moon, and if it happens that, at the same</p><p> time, a strong wind is blowing up the Gulf,</p><p> the tide reaches truly formidable propor-</p><p> tions, sweeping over even the highest banks</p><p> and destroying both property and life.</p><p> This, of course, in old days, when there was</p><p> a port here; now there is sand, solitude and</p><p> sky.</p><p>Nov. 14—To-day we ran out of </p><p> whisky, so Frank concluded to give</p><p> up the trip and return to Yuma.</p><p> His brother Pete also concluded that the</p><p> salt-water looked too dry for him. Frank</p><p> argued that it was only three miles across</p><p> the tule flats to old Ponciano Dominguez’s</p><p> Ranch. He had heard that Dominguez</p><p> sold contraband mescal to the Cocopah</p><p> Indians, so the thing looked both promising</p><p> and easy. He and Pete could easily pack</p><p> their rifles and blankets across, secure</p><p> horses from Dominguez and return to Yuma.</p><p> Charlie and I expostulated in vain; Frank</p><p> had made up his mind and Pete didn’t have</p><p> any. After they were gone, Charlie and I</p><p> smoked mournfully for a time, then Charlie</p><p> said “-Now while I fully agreed</p><p> with him, I mentioned the fact that the</p><p> grub would last two men twice as long as</p><p> four. At this sapient remark Charlie</p><p> brightened up, and began to sing in the</p><p> Honolulu language.</p><p> Nov. 15—This morning I killed a 600-</p><p> pound jewfish, with a finely-placed shot.</p><p> As he broke water, I pulled trigger. The</p><p> shot cut the spine at the base of the skull.</p><p> We are making “jerkey” out of him. The</p><p>bushes around camp are strung with ropes, </p><p>great and small, and every rope is weighed </p><p>down with great white flakes of fish. At </p><p>noon I shot an egret, cutting his neck in two, </p><p>with the .22-long Winchester. His plumes </p><p>were in fine shape, glossy and beautiful. </p><p>Egret plumes are worth $40 per ounce in </p><p>Yuma—in good, hard, iron money. At </p><p>sundown the long expanse of the river- </p><p>mouth was alive with leaping mullet. Mil- </p><p>lions were in the air at one time. I have </p><p>never seen so many fish. This fish is about </p><p>fourteen inches long, plump and juicy and </p><p>of fine flavor, gray on the back, bright silver </p><p>on the sides and dead white on the belly. </p><p>We got eleven with the gill-net within ten </p><p>■minutes. The mullet run into the river </p><p>from the Gulf with the flood-tide, as far as </p><p>the water is brackish with salt. They pene- </p><p>trate every slough of the great tide-flats and </p><p>with a net, as the tide runs out, they may be </p><p>caught by the ton. These waters are un- </p><p>fished, and are simply alive with finny </p><p>denizens. </p><p> The bones of four large vessels project</p><p>from the sands of Shipyard Slough. These </p><p>derelicts date from the days when Yuma </p><p>was a proud United States port. Long be- </p><p>fore Collis P. Huntington built his Southern </p><p>Pacific Railroad across the Continent this </p><p>spot was a busy and thriving city of four </p><p>houses. The climate being perfect, the </p><p>people slept on board, or on the sands </p><p>around the houses; going inside for a drink, </p><p>if not broke. Now all this civilization is no </p><p>more; only empty whisky-bottles and the </p><p>bones of the dead ships attest the former </p><p>opulence. Sea-going ships anchored here,</p><p>to meet the river-steamers that carried all </p><p>freight to Yuma, whence it was freighted on </p><p>wagon-trains, to forts, towns and mining- </p><p>camps for hundreds of miles over the Desert. </p><p>Now the great tule and hemp flats are </p><p>peopled with only wild hogs, millions of </p><p>aquatic creatures and billions of mosquitoes. </p><p>“Sic transit gloria mundil” </p><p> Nov. 16—We are now on Montague</p><p>Island. It is five miles across to the Lower </p><p>California bank and eight to the Sonora </p><p>side at Shipyard Slough. The island is some </p><p>ten miles long by one mile wide—a low, </p><p>flat sand-island, covered with short salt- </p><p>grass and birdnests. Innumerable pelicans, </p><p>cranes, geese, ducks, gulls, flamingoes, and </p><p>heaven knows what other winged creatures </p><p>come here to breed. The birds are very </p><p>tame, showing little fear Of man. The near- </p><p>Adventuring in Tiburon </p><p>279 </p><p>cst human habitation is that of old man </p><p>Dominguez; beyond his one lone house </p><p>there is no other dwelling-place nearer than </p><p>La Grulla, eighty miles to the north. Both </p><p>coasts here are treeless, waterless, sunburnt </p><p>sand wastes. Here and there a reef of black </p><p>Malpai rock crops out of the eternal sand. </p><p>Rain seldom falls, and when this rare phe- </p><p>nomenon does occur it is likely to be a Sum- </p><p>mer thunder-shower, wetting a meager and </p><p>limited patch of sand. </p><p> Many great turtles crawl out on the</p><p>beaches of this island to lay. From one </p><p>nest we dug some two bushels of eggs. This </p><p>looks as if several “lady turtles” did busi- </p><p>ness together. The eggs are palatable and, </p><p>in my opinion, preferable to sea-bird eggs. </p><p>The Mexican fishermen of this coast call </p><p>this turtle the carapachi, and are said to </p><p>esteem its flesh very highly. We found no </p><p>sign of human beings on the island, not even </p><p>the char of an old campfire. Charlie said </p><p>that no one ever comes here but stray pearl- </p><p>fishers from La Paz or Muleje, and then only </p><p>when they are in hard straits for drinking </p><p>water and put into the mouth of the river </p><p>to fill their kegs. </p><p>Nov. 18—After a most glorious sail </p><p>of sixty miles, we are safe and sound </p><p>behind Point San Felipe. If there </p><p>was ever a desert paradise on earth, this is </p><p>one. Somewhere up on the American Line </p><p>the Sierra Nevadas split in two. One of the </p><p>forks strikes down by the southeast, to butt </p><p>boldly into the Gulf of California. We have </p><p>found a sheltered cove, some shade trees and </p><p>a small spring of sweet water. At extreme</p><p>low tide a hot spring boils up from the </p><p>sands at the water’s edge. This water is </p><p>very hot and somewhat sulphurous. Our </p><p>drinking spring is a mere trickle from the </p><p>cliffs, a dainty rock-pool, holding but a </p><p>few gallons. </p><p> We found many wild-game tracks around</p><p>this spring, apparently those of mountain </p><p>sheep or deer. The tide-rocks are covered </p><p>with great masses and clumps of oysters. </p><p>The water of the inlet is so clear that even </p><p>small fish may be seen at great depths. We </p><p>have [blockhauled the boat and are pre- </p><p>pared for a long stay, for truly we have </p><p>found a sportsman’s paradise! </p><p> Nov. ig—Alas, our Eden has its ser-</p><p>pents! Charlie has killed six rattlesnakes, </p><p>and I nine. Unfortunately this is not the </p><p>worst of it, for this place is wormy with </p><p>hydrophobia skunks — diminutive, spotted, </p><p>pests, more dangerous than any^other </p><p>living animal! During the night onef^f </p><p>these abominations touched my face, giving </p><p>me a fine scare. After this I sleep in t&amp;e. </p><p>launched boat! Charlie is a stoic and ne«is </p><p>no nerve-tonics. My wild yell in the niglfl </p><p>brought him up sitting, rifle in hand. </p><p> “What’s de matta?” he asked.</p><p> “ One of theseblankety—blank—ety blShfi</p><p>skunks touched my face!” I cried, </p><p> “ Did him bait you? ”</p><p> “No,” said I, “but he scared nine kinds</p><p>of tar out of me!” </p><p> “Well,” said Charlie philosophically, “if</p><p>you is scare, you can’t sleep, so mak up firt^ </p><p>an’ keep’m off me; I sleepy.” </p><p> So my guide, philosopher and friend lay</p><p>calmly back in his blankets and snored </p><p>peacefully the rest of the night. Charlie is </p><p>a gentleman; even his snore is musically </p><p>gentle. He carries his sixty years like a day </p><p>and his frame is as vigorous as that of a boy </p><p>of twenty. He is a primitively simple and </p><p>honest man, taking no thought for the future, </p><p>hating no man and fearing no living thing </p><p>under the sun. Happy Charlie! </p><p> These hydrophobia skunks are the most</p><p>horrible of created creatures. They are less </p><p>than one quarter of the size of the ordinary ( </p><p>skunk, are spotted and are very vicious. *« In </p><p>new countries, where men camp out and </p><p>sleep on the ground, they are more danger- </p><p>ous than a hundred rattlesnakes. The </p><p>snake strikes solely in self-defense, while the </p><p>skunk is a nocturnal prowler, biting without </p><p>provocation the unfortunate sleeper. About </p><p>ten per cent, of the deaths in Lower Cali- </p><p>fornia are due to the bites of this skunk.</p><p>The people are poor and apathetic; they </p><p>sleep on the ground and have no doors to </p><p>their huts. The skunks are numerous, are </p><p>vicious with the disease and bite them. The </p><p>bitten person contracts hydrophobia from </p><p>the bite and dies a terrible death. “It is </p><p>God’s will! For if he willed it not, how </p><p>could it happen? Who may go against the </p><p>will of God? ” They are worthless folk, and </p><p>fatalists. </p><p> Nov. 20—'To-day has been a peach! At</p><p>daybreak I took the 30-30 carbine and went </p><p>out for deer. I did not get a deer, but I did </p><p>get two tremendously fine bighorn sheep, </p><p>I ran into a band of twelve and proceeded to </p><p>lay out the two patriarchs of the flock. </p><p>Both were fat as butter, and each had a </p><p>splendid head of horns. Fortunately I </p><p>280 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>I made the kill near camp, for both sheep were </p><p> very heavy. I went in with one, staggering</p><p> under the heavy load. Charlie was dis-</p><p> gusted.</p><p> “What for you shoot ole he one?” he</p><p> snorted.</p><p> ' When I got my breath I said, “For the</p><p> horns, Charlie; they will make such splendid</p><p> frophies.”</p><p> n We no eat horn! ” he asseverated sourly.</p><p> , “That is true, Charlie,” said I, “but just</p><p> think of the immense satisfaction of the</p><p> trophies!”</p><p> •After ruminating over this strange view</p><p> of hunting, Charlie’s native gentility came</p><p> to his aid. He smiled wanly and then said</p><p> hopefully, “Mebbe you sell ’m horn to</p><p> Tenderfoot.”</p><p> “Mebbe so,” I conceded weakly.</p><p> Going up to the spring for water, I shot a</p><p> mountain Hon. I came very near not seeing</p><p> him as he crept away among the rocks.</p><p> He, too, had gone for water, to find death at</p><p> the hands of a strange creature that he had</p><p> never seen before. No more juicy fawns for</p><p> his lion ship! His skin isn’t overfine, but</p><p> maybe I can “sell’m to Tenderfoot.”</p><p>Nov. 21—We have jerked both of </p><p>the sheep. They made a full gunny- </p><p>sack of jerky. The meat is fat, </p><p>savory and tender, so I have risen in </p><p>Charlie’s esteem. </p><p> We have neighbors! Four lean, dirty,</p><p> Mexican pearl-fishers, from Muleje. They</p><p> beat around the point of rocks about 3 P. M.,</p><p> saw our smoke and steered for our boat.</p><p> When near, one of them called out to know</p><p> if we had found fresh water. On our reply-</p><p> ing in the affirmative, they landed. When</p><p> they were ashore they came up to shake</p><p> hands. We picked up our rifles and de-</p><p> clined this honor, contenting ourselves with</p><p> directing them to the spring. This is a lone</p><p> place, far from courts of justice. They each</p><p> carry a long knife and their looks are very</p><p> villainous, and our boat and outfit are very</p><p> desirable to such as these, so we are warily</p><p> polite, knowing that dead “ Gringos ” tell no</p><p> tales. They unloaded four water-kegs and</p><p> started for the spring. When they returned</p><p> I called one of them over and gave him</p><p> some jerked meat, some coffee and tobacco.</p><p> After a mellowing-up smoke he became</p><p> very communicative. “Down the coast,”</p><p> said he, “where two sharp rocks project</p><p> from the sea, there is much oro [gold].”</p><p> Why didn’t they dig it out?</p><p> They were only pearl-fishers and knew</p><p>nothing about gold-mining. He had seen </p><p>the grains of gold, however, in the sands </p><p>of a dry gulch. </p><p> “Is there any fresh water there?”</p><p> “No water.”</p><p> “How far is it?”</p><p> “Two days’ sail, if the wind is good.”</p><p> “ Where are you going? ”</p><p> “Back to Muleje, with our pearls.” He</p><p>here undid a greasy belt and showed us some </p><p>really beautiful pearls. He frankly ad- </p><p>mitted that they were poachers. God, said </p><p>he, had made the sea and the pearl-oyster. </p><p>A bad Government had sold the pearl </p><p>monopoly to English and French pearl- </p><p>companies, thus depriving the poor of a </p><p>natural right. He, for one, did not concur, </p><p>so he poached. “This pearl,” said he, “is </p><p>worth at least 600 pesos, yet we will get </p><p>scarcely 200 pesos for it, since we are con- </p><p>strained to sell our pearls to illicit pearl- </p><p>buyers, who cheat us.” He would, however, </p><p>sell it to us, very cheap. We thanked him, </p><p>but declined on the plea of poverty. He </p><p>sniffed incredulously, and then took his de- </p><p>parture, after bidding us good-night and </p><p>thanking us for the food. </p><p> That night I slept all night, while Charlie</p><p>watched. He was to have awakened me at </p><p>midnight for my turn, but he did not do so, </p><p>for Charlie is, as I said, a gentleman. </p><p> Nov. 22—They went away at dawn—</p><p>back down the Lower California coast. </p><p>When they were decently around the point, </p><p>I took the 30-30 carbine and slipped out on </p><p>the farther rocks to see that they really went. </p><p>When I peered cautiously over the last rock, </p><p>they were a mile away, under full sail for the</p><p>south. I sat on the rocks and watched the </p><p>sunrise. Almighty God, how wonderful are </p><p>Thy works! Out from the bosom of a silver </p><p>sea rose the sun in spotless splendor; far out </p><p>at sea, a school of whales played and gam- </p><p>boled, spouting into the air streams of spun </p><p>silver, then diving, to reappear farther on. </p><p>The boat of the Mexicans became a mere </p><p>dot on the southern horizon. I was glad to </p><p>be alive, for was not the world beautiful, </p><p>beautiful, beautiful! </p><p> I	went back to Charlie, and a steaming</p><p>pot of coffee. </p><p> “Gone?”</p><p> Yes, really gone. Did he believe the story</p><p>about the gold? </p><p> Yes, he believed it, for Captain Polhemus,</p><p>Adventuring in Tiburon </p><p>28i </p><p>of Yuma, had told him the same story. </p><p>Polhemus was no Mexican and no liar. </p><p>Should we hunt for it? </p><p> Yes, if I wanted to go. We had six empty</p><p>five-gallon coal-oil cans that would hold </p><p>fifteen days’ water—if we didn’t wash. </p><p>II </p><p> Nov. 24—The jerky is all packed,</p><p>Buy the coal-oil-cans are lashed tight </p><p>amidships and every canteen and </p><p>bottle is a-brim for the trip. We have </p><p>cooked ten days’ rations of bread, so as to </p><p>economize water when once off down this </p><p>dry coast. At xx a. m. we pulled out with </p><p>the oars far enough to catch the breeze. </p><p>As the sail bellied out and the ropes drew </p><p>taut, we waved a farewell to our snaky, </p><p>pole-catty paradise. Like all mundane </p><p>things, it has its good and evil intimately </p><p>blended. We were not bitten and we did </p><p>have fine hunting, fishing and bathing. The </p><p>sun was clear and warm, the breeze pure and </p><p>‘ the bills very, very beautiful. </p><p> Charlie was right to a dot about stealing</p><p>the rail for a keel. This heavy ninety- </p><p>pound rail trims the craft beautifully and in </p><p>a stiff breeze the boat behaves like a thing of </p><p>life. We are making about three knots, </p><p>and at this rate should sight the twin rocks </p><p>by noon to-morrow. We have pored over </p><p>our U. S. Coast Survey chart, and have </p><p>come to the conclusion that the Greaser’s </p><p>“twin rocks” must mean the San Louis </p><p>Islands in the Bay of Vistado, some seventy- </p><p>five miles S.E. by S. </p><p> The wind freshened to a half-gale by 3</p><p>p. m., so we took two reefs in the mainsail. </p><p>Charlie is a bolder sailor than myself. I </p><p>prefer to do my dying on dry land, so when</p><p>a comber slaps me in the face, it dampens </p><p>my enthusiasm. Bailing water ceaselessly </p><p>for some hours becomes real, true exercise </p><p>after the second hour. Charlie had the </p><p>tiller and I had the bailing-can, and the </p><p>brine that dripped from my noble brow did </p><p>not all come from the ocean. About half- </p><p>past six we saw a cove and steered for it. </p><p>The shore was rocky and uninviting, but a </p><p>closer acquaintance showed a little creek- </p><p>like slough, where the water was still as a </p><p>church. I landed and collected enough </p><p>brush to cook supper and breakfast. </p><p> Nov. 25—This morning we pulled out into</p><p>the offing and waited for a breeze. As no </p><p>breeze showed up, we began to fish, catching </p><p>a number of worthless croakers, two young ’ </p><p>sharks, and five fine rockbass. Afeout 9 </p><p>a. m. the wind came, so we “up-stick-and- </p><p>away,” for the south. The wind freshened </p><p>steadily until about four o'clock, when it </p><p>began to blow in puffs. Toward night we </p><p>watched the coast for an inlet and, findilf" </p><p>none, resolved to sail in the moonlight. Just </p><p>before sundown we sighted the islands, thej </p><p>almost immediately saw the high hill-pcfint </p><p>of Cape Final. Charlie turned in for t!je </p><p>first sleep and I let him sleep until half-past- </p><p>three in the morning. The sea was fairly </p><p>smooth and the night-breeze soft and dSi- : </p><p>dous. Great fish leaped at intervals from at </p><p>the dim sea and unseen gulls called from the </p><p>distant shore. After the moon went down </p><p>the sky became a marvel of glittering worlds. ♦ </p><p>Ah, but I love the Night and her stars! </p><p> Nov. 26—When I woke I smelled coffee.</p><p>Peeping out of the cuddy-hole, I saw Charlie </p><p>with a finely puckered brow, frying fish and </p><p>trying to dodge smoke. The “ smoke-nui- </p><p>sance ” of our great dties is not in it with the </p><p>smoke of a measly brush campfire. Times </p><p>innumerable I have circled a campfire like </p><p>a merry-go-round, but the smoke would </p><p>persist in blowing my way, going up my </p><p>nose, making my eyes water and making me </p><p>swear like a pirate. </p><p> Breakfast over, we hoisted the sheet and</p><p>started to cruise aJong the mainland, looking </p><p>for a good shelter. We found none to suit </p><p>us, so we picked out a smooth path of sand </p><p>and ran the boat ashore. We then rigged </p><p>our block and tackle and pulled the boat </p><p>clear into the brush, so as to hide her from </p><p>any stray sea-prowlers who might happen </p><p>along. In the afternoon I took the 30-30 </p><p>carbine and went prospecting. About a </p><p>mile inland I came upon two fresh human </p><p>tracks, evidently those of an Indian buck</p><p>and his squaw. Going back, I told Charlie, </p><p>who only grunted. </p><p> “If,” said I, “any Indians live around</p><p>here, they drink fresh water. Let’s look </p><p>them up.” </p><p> Charlie grunted again, but this time it</p><p>was a grunt of assent. </p><p> Nov. 27—We started at daybreak with</p><p>our rifles and the two-gallon canteen. I </p><p>took the trail of the Indians and followed it </p><p>some three miles inland. Here we came out </p><p>on the edge of a deep canyon that had a </p><p>wide, flat bottom. Down in this flat we saw </p><p>a dozen or two wickyups, the smoke from </p><p>which showed them to be inhabited. We </p><p>2 82 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>slipped down a small side ravine and came </p><p>out beside a large wickyup, where a squaw </p><p>was skinning a turtle. When she saw us she </p><p>dropped the turtle, squalled and lit out like </p><p>a streak. The whole village now took to </p><p>the brush, leaving us alone with the huts. </p><p>We called loudly to them in Spanish, say- </p><p>ing "Amigo, amigo/” but with no further </p><p>result than to accelerate their speed. </p><p> We now examined the huts. The wickyup</p><p>ol the “turtle-lady” had two large water- </p><p>ollas, three’earthen cooking-pots, a metate </p><p>for grinding corn or seeds and a couple of </p><p>fisli-spears. In one corner we found a gourd </p><p>partly full of pumpkin-seed, a piece of </p><p>broken mirror and a joint of reed. Shaking </p><p>the joint of reed, we found that it rattled </p><p>inside, and further examination disclosed </p><p>the fact that it contained about an ounce of </p><p>placer-gold. </p><p> We now started to look for the water-</p><p>hole, and found it some half-mile down the </p><p>canyon. The Indians had dug a hole in the </p><p>sands of the arroyo, where, at the depth of </p><p>some four feet, they had found passable </p><p>drinking water. Then we went back to the </p><p>wickyup of the “turtle-lady,” and left some </p><p>tobacco on her stone metate, as a free gift. </p><p>WE RETURNED to the boat, and </p><p>there, at sundown, an old Indian </p><p>hailed us from the bluffs. On our </p><p>making him friendly overtures, he came </p><p>down to see us. Ke spoke fairly good </p><p>Spanish and seemed very intelligent. We </p><p>gave him a good supper, and whfle he got </p><p>on the outside of this, we talked. He said </p><p>his name was Tomas, and that the name of </p><p>his people was “Simangitos.” This tribe, </p><p>he said, was very poor and very few in num- </p><p>ber. He said that they lived on grass seeds, </p><p>picayunes, fish, turtles and an occasional</p><p>deer. They had no corn, because the coun- </p><p>try was too dry to plant corn. He said that </p><p>they washed a limited amount of placer- </p><p>gold out of the sands of the dry-washes. At </p><p>long intervals one or more of tiiem took this </p><p>gold across on the other side (Pacific) and </p><p>traded it to Mexicans for flour and cloth. </p><p> “Have any white men ever come here</p><p>before? ” I asked. </p><p> “Two parties have come,” said he. “The</p><p>first to come were two white men who came </p><p>in a boat like yours. These brought a ma- </p><p>chine [dry-washer] and took out much gold. </p><p>They were good men and cured our sick, but </p><p>they themselves got sick and died. When </p><p>they were dead we hid their machine in a </p><p>cave and told no one, for we were afraid that </p><p>the Mexican police would think that we had </p><p>killed them. We loved them and did not </p><p>kill them.” </p><p> “Of what did they die?” I asked.</p><p>“Of the bubble-sickness,” he replied. </p><p>Seeing that I did not comprehend, Charlie </p><p>told me that the Indians called smallpox the </p><p>“bubble-sickness,” from the pustules that </p><p>broke out on the patient. </p><p> “The others,” said Tomas, “came in a</p><p>very large boat that smoked much. These </p><p>were rough and bad men. They were ten in </p><p>number. Seven of these were Mexicans, </p><p>who stole our food and attacked our women. </p><p>We ran away into the hills, and in the night </p><p>our young men slipped back and slew four of </p><p>them. The others then made a great smoke </p><p>on their boat and went away.” </p><p> “Dat was Captain Polhemus an’ his</p><p>outfit,” put in Charlie. “I remember dat </p><p>time. Dey come in steam tug, an’ Polhe- </p><p>mus he bring seven Mexican from Yuma.” </p><p>I gave Tomas a pound of tobacco, one of </p><p>coffee, two of sugar and ten of flour. “ Here,” </p><p>said I, “are some gifts; take these home and </p><p>come again early to-morrow.” </p><p> The old man took his gifts and silently</p><p>disappeared in the night. Presently we </p><p>heard the subdued gabble of voices from the </p><p>cliff. Tomas had not come alone, but, like </p><p>a prudent general, had hidden his forces for </p><p>reprisal in case of bad faith. </p><p> Nov. 28—About six this morning Tomas</p><p>was back with a sack of roots that he </p><p>claimed were very good eating. Six young </p><p>men came with him. These had good faces </p><p>and were lithe, quick, straight fellows. </p><p>Their deportment was the epitome of grave </p><p>modesty. They sat on the sand in silence, </p><p>speaking only when spoken to, and evincing </p><p>no curiosity. I made a great pot of coffee,</p><p>and then served them a huge meal of coffee, </p><p>bread and jerked jewfish. When they were </p><p>as full as they could hold, every face beamed </p><p>with good feeling. </p><p> “Charlie,’’ said I, “I believe we can trust</p><p>these people.” </p><p> “Yaas,” said Charlie, “if you don’t do</p><p>’em no bad t’ing, trust ’em.” </p><p> The Indians now had a great confab in</p><p>their own tongue. When they were done, </p><p>Tomas said, “The two good white men who </p><p>died here were our brothers. They cured </p><p>many of us from the bubble-sickness. Their </p><p>medicine was so strong that we have never </p><p>Adventuring in Tiburon </p><p>283 </p><p>understood why they died.. We have now a </p><p>fine young man very sick. A month ago he </p><p>took our gold and went over on the other </p><p>coast to trade. When he came back he be- </p><p>came very ill. First a bad cold-spirit makes </p><p>aim very cold, then a hot-spirit makes him </p><p>burn. We would like that you cure him, if </p><p>your medicine is as strong as that of the </p><p>other two good white men.” </p><p> “I will consult with my partner,” said I.</p><p>The Indians now respectfully withdrew. </p><p>“ Charlie,” said I, “this sick Indian has evi- </p><p>dently contracted malaria on the other coast. </p><p>We have plenty of quinine and calomel, so </p><p>J am going over to cure him.” </p><p> “Very well,” said Charlie, “go and cure</p><p>him.” </p><p> I now made up a bed-roll, took the needed</p><p>medicine and called over one of the young </p><p>men. “Come,” said I, “you are strong. </p><p>Bring my bed along.” </p><p>Dec. 2—The sick man is cured of his </p><p>chills and fever. He is still very </p><p>weak, but thecoldandhotdevilshave </p><p>Jled before the “strong medicine” of the </p><p>white man. Nothing can exceed the silent </p><p>esteem and gratitude of these poor savages. </p><p>This morning Ahtu, the sick man, took my </p><p>right foot and put it upon his head, The </p><p>assembled onlookers all cried “Tu-roo, tu- </p><p>rool" (good, good), </p><p> Tomas'cagie in from a turtle huntat noon.</p><p>He said, “You men are now our brothers. </p><p>You white men love gold; we have the ma- </p><p>chine hidden in a cave, and it is still good. </p><p>We will give it to you, so that you may gel </p><p>much gold.” </p><p> Dec. 3—The machine is a thirty-ton dry-</p><p>washer. As this climate is so dry that </p><p>nothing rots, all that the machine needs is </p><p>overhauling and grease. We will set it up </p><p>in the same place it was worked before.</p><p> Dec. 4—Ahtu, Charlie and myself have</p><p>now run the dry-washer for two days. We </p><p>have taken out four and a half ounces of </p><p>gold. At $16 per ounce, this makes $12 a </p><p>day per man. It is needless to state that </p><p>we are well pleased. I have sent four of the </p><p>young men across to Encinal to buy flour, </p><p>charging them strictly to say nothing of our </p><p>presence to any one whatsoever. </p><p> Ahtu has offered me as a free gift his</p><p>most precious possession, to wit, his wife. </p><p>1 have thanked him kindly, stating that we </p><p>while men, when good men, love only one </p><p>woma n, and that, as I already love the One </p><p>Woman, I can not honestly love two. This </p><p>phase of male virtue seems beyond ^is </p><p>primitive philosophy, yet he has silently </p><p>acquiesced, as he does in all things that are </p><p>my will. I believe he loves me in his dumb </p><p>and simple fashion—and I am not displeased. </p><p> Charlie is “making googoo eyes” at a coy</p><p>widow. This lady’s name is Ma-hat-mi, </p><p>and she is the relict of two successive gentle- </p><p>men who have both passed out by the bubble </p><p>sickness route. The lady herself has the </p><p>“face-of-a-thousand-pits,” for she had the </p><p>disease herself. She is fairly young, how- </p><p>ever, kindly and industrious. I have </p><p>noticed that Charlie is easily pleased, and </p><p>that his ideas on some subjects resemble </p><p>strongly those of the upper-class Stone Age. </p><p> Dec. 7—Ma-hat-mi to-day became Mrs.</p><p>Charles Kanaka. The ceremony was short, </p><p>sweet and unaffected. The bride wore </p><p>neither veil nor orange-blossoms, being </p><p>adorned with only her native virtue, a new- </p><p>red handkerchief, a bag skirt of calico and </p><p>a man’s shirt, the latter presented by my- </p><p>self. She was very proud of this gift, wear- </p><p>ing it outside of everything, d la Chinaman. </p><p>At 2 p. M. a drum was beaten by the bride’s </p><p>brother, while a cousin blew plaintive notes </p><p>on a reed flute. This wedding-march was </p><p>continuous during the nuptial feast, said </p><p>feast consisting of coffee, beans, boiled com, </p><p>dried pumpkin, fish and turtle-eggs. We </p><p>had also some edible roots, baked to a turn. </p><p>The soul and core of the ceremony itself </p><p>consisted in the bride and groom eating a </p><p>small turtle together, the turtle being a </p><p>sacred emblem. </p><p> After the feast we smoked, told stories and</p><p>gambled for gold-dust. Fortune favored </p><p>Ahtu, whose skill or luck was phenomenal. </p><p> Dec. 8—Last night Ahtu surreptitiously</p><p>added his winnings to my sack of gold-dust. </p><p>This Indian is a gentleman, one of God’s </p><p>fools—such as he who found Richard Cceur-</p><p>de-Leon in his Austrian prison. Of course, </p><p>I w’on’t keep the dust, but I am touched </p><p>beyond words. Tomas has the belly-ache </p><p>—too much turtle-egg. I am giving him a </p><p>dose of salts. One of the turtle-eggs must </p><p>have been sour. </p><p> Dec. g—Yesterday Charlie resolved to</p><p>move his honeymoon up to the dry-washer. </p><p>Ma-hat-mi is now chief cook and bottle- </p><p>washer for the three of us—ably assisted by </p><p>Mrs. Ahtu. She watches Charlie like a </p><p>faithful pup, who, loving and trusting his </p><p>master, ever yearns to lick his hand. Some </p><p>284 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> white ladies might take a leaf out of Ma-</p><p> hat-mfs book—else I have been a sorry</p><p> observer. The gold is piling up rapidly,</p><p> skunks are none, snakes are few, and the</p><p> Winter weather is ideal.</p><p>Dec. 10—A ragged, starved Mexican </p><p> peon was found down on the beach</p><p> by one of. the women. He has a</p><p> great, livid wound in his head and is in</p><p> the last stages of emaciation from hunger</p><p> and thirst. We went down to see him,</p><p> then had the Indians bring him up to</p><p> camp, where we fed him broth every two</p><p> hours. Tomas was displeased at our ac-</p><p> tion. “Better kill this Mexican,” said</p><p> he. “These people are like snakes — if</p><p> you warm them, they bite you!” All the</p><p> village got into a great discussion at this;</p><p> finally I went out and said to them, “I will</p><p> not have this man slain. When he is well,</p><p> we will bind his eyes so that he can not see</p><p> the trail, and send him away to Encinal.”</p><p> As usual, they deferred to me.</p><p> Dec. 12—The Mexican is much better and</p><p> stronger. He says that his name is Pedro</p><p> Castaneda and that he is a pearl-fisher from</p><p> La Paz. Last September he and four others</p><p> sailed from La Paz in an open yawl, to</p><p> poach for pearls. They had poor luck until</p><p> a month ago, when they struck a phenome-</p><p> nally rich bank from which they took two</p><p> hundred pearls in ten days, some of them</p><p> worth great sums. Running short of water,</p><p> they landed just south of Cape Final to</p><p> search for a spring they had been told was</p><p> there. He jpd one of his comrades had</p><p> gone inland to look for the spring, and when</p><p> they returned to the beach, the men, pearls</p><p> and boat were gone, leaving them marooned</p><p> to a dreadful death. His comrade had be-</p><p> come violently insane with fear and had</p><p> assaulted him with a club, inflicting a great</p><p> gash in his head. Luckily he had his</p><p> . knife-!</p><p> “Where did you kill this man?” I asked.</p><p> “On the beach, some five hundred meters</p><p> south of the Point,” he replied.</p><p> The Indians heard him in silence, but I</p><p> could see disbelief plainly written in their</p><p> faces. They have suffered much harm in</p><p> the past from Mexicans, hence do not love</p><p> them. Tomas says he will send two young</p><p> men down there to read the tracks.</p><p> Dec. 13—The two sign-readers are back.</p><p> They say that the Mexican is a liar. It is</p><p> true that a boat has recently landed behind</p><p>the point, that five men landed from the </p><p>boat; true that one dead Mexican lies on the </p><p>beach. The rest of the Mexican’s story is </p><p>false, since the tracks show plainly that all </p><p>five men were in the struggle. Tomas be- </p><p>lieves that Castaneda and the dead Greaser </p><p>tried to sneak away with the boat and pearls </p><p>while the others slept. He thinks that they </p><p>were discovered and set upon at the water’s </p><p>edge, where one was slain and our friei^L </p><p>Castaneda knocked senseless and abandoned.' </p><p>Charlie and I concur with him. We will </p><p>send this man away so soon as he can stand </p><p>the four days’ walk. In the meantime we </p><p>will keep silent about the dry-washer, 'nbt </p><p>wishing to bring a horde of Greaser gdld-'. </p><p>seekers down on our Simangito friends or on </p><p>ourselves.	,'"y"</p><p> Dec. 15—Castafieda has been sent'away.</p><p>He bitterly objected to the blm&lt;£foId, but </p><p>submitted sullenly when he saw that re- </p><p>sistance was useless. To-day Ma-Uat-ipl </p><p>found a nugget weighing six ounces! She </p><p>had gone up a “little red canyonv .to- dig </p><p>edible roots for dinner. She found .one of </p><p>the plants she sought, growing in the vety </p><p>bed of the wash. Digging dSwfi'fOr. the </p><p>root, she struck bed-rock and this beautiful </p><p>nugget. Ahtu and I are going bafk with </p><p>her to-morrow, taking a shovel, a pick and </p><p>a gold-pan. </p><p> Dec. 17—Talk about luck! Mrs:.Charlie</p><p>is a brown replica of the goddess'Ulfirself! </p><p>The gulch is rich, rich beyond our fondest" </p><p>hopes—rich as -! We move the dry- </p><p>washer over in the morning. When Charlie </p><p>saw our cleanup (five pans), he said, “Jack, </p><p>if dat-Greaser know what we do here, </p><p>we get all de - yellow cut-troat from </p><p>other side.” </p><p> “That is unfortunately true, Charlie,”</p><p>said I, “but I couldn’t have him killed like </p><p>a beef, thief and liar though he be.” </p><p> Seeing the wrinkles of apprehension on</p><p>Charlie’s brow, Ma-hat-mi rose silently,</p><p>filled his pipe and brought it to him, a live </p><p>coal neatly balanced on top of the tobacco. </p><p>She has most white ladies looking like thirty </p><p>cents—and even her smallpox marks become </p><p>her of late. </p><p> Dec. iq—We have taken out 37 pounds of</p><p>gold in the last three days! $192 per pound, </p><p>multiplied by 37=57,104—just thinly of it! </p><p>We are searching for the ledge it eroded </p><p>from, although most old miners claim that </p><p>coarse placer seldom or never comes from a </p><p>vein. In this instance they 6eem to be borne </p><p>Adventuring in Tiburon </p><p>out by the facts. Our gulch is short, steep, </p><p>and bare from where we are working on up </p><p>the hill. From there up, the rocks of the </p><p>sidehills are simply barren and rotten </p><p>schist bedrock. A hundred yards below the </p><p>machine our gulch debouches into the great </p><p>dry-wash, where the bed-rock is buried </p><p>under hundreds of feet of sand, pebbles and </p><p>boulders. As it now stands, our rich chan- </p><p>nel is being buried deeper and deeper at </p><p>every foot that we mine downhill. Up the </p><p>gulch there is neither earth nor gold—only </p><p>the bare, rotten schist. </p><p> Dec. 24—Gosh-wii. and Ah-chit-weh are</p><p>back. They report that they left Castaneda </p><p>in sight of Encinal. They took him to the </p><p>top of the last sand ridge and told him to </p><p>“Git!” </p><p> *‘Did he try to follow you back?” I asked.</p><p> ‘No,” said Gosh-wa, “he no come.”</p><p> That night Ahtu said to me: “If my</p><p>brother will promise not to be angry, I will </p><p>give him some news.” When I promised, he </p><p>continued: “When Gosh-wi and Ah-chit- </p><p>d'eh took the Mexican away, they saw that </p><p>hi^heart was bad, for he had secretly made </p><p>sfriall hfcles in his bandage so that he could </p><p>see the trail. When they started, Gosh-wa </p><p>had ten arrows in his quiver and Ah-chit- </p><p>weh twelve. Gosh-wil returned with nine </p><p>arrows and Ah-chit-weh with ten. We </p><p>Sjmp-ngitos are careful of our arrows, since </p><p>straight stems are very scarce. We recover </p><p>the arrows when we shoot game. We de- </p><p>stroy them when a man dies, or when we </p><p>slay an enemy.” </p><p> “I am sorry to hear this, Ahtu,” said I,</p><p>“ vet at the same time it may be for the best, </p><p>since tjascS8£da was, as you say, an evil </p><p>man.”	.......—'—'</p><p>Dec. 25—This is Christmas Day. </p><p>We have made a great feast and I </p><p>have told the Indians the story of </p><p>the death of the Christ. They said that </p><p>they had heard this story long ago from</p><p>their fathers, who had heard it from Mission </p><p>priests. They had not believed the story, </p><p>however, since if God had the power, he </p><p>need not have slain his son, when his sim- </p><p>plest wish would have made all men good. </p><p>They were content with the religion of their </p><p>fathers, since the story of “Tse-huh,” and </p><p>the “ Great Turtle ” seemed more reasonable. </p><p> Jan. 1—Our rich streak is worked out as</p><p>far as the heavy overburden will permit. If </p><p>we had a'steam hoist, timbers and heavy </p><p>285 </p><p> *</p><p> boards, we would attempt to go under thfi</p><p> deep sands of the great dry-wash; as it</p><p> now stands it would be courting death</p><p> to attempt it. Our rich dirt has spoiled us</p><p> for the §i2-a-day diggings, so we are going</p><p> to leave here and look for the rich pearl- *</p><p> bank Castaneda told of. We have told pie</p><p> Indians and they are very sad. Ahtu and</p><p> his younger brother, To-we6, are going with</p><p> us. “Where you go, I go,” said Ahtu. Mrs,</p><p> Ahtu and Mrs. Charles Kanaka are out on •</p><p> the ridge, howling mournfully under the</p><p> stars. The grief of Mrs. Ahtu is in A Minor,</p><p> while that of Ma-hat-mf is G Major, fioth</p><p> ladies are like Mrs. Noah—they want to go</p><p> in the boat.</p><p>Ill	»</p><p>Jan. 5—Twenty and two Simangifcos </p><p> sat dejectedly on the beach as we</p><p> rowed the boat out into the offing.</p><p> Mrs. Ahtu and Mrs. Charlie Kanaka ran</p><p> distractedly up and down the beach, making</p><p> the air resound to their cries. I steered the</p><p> boat and Charlie pulled the oars. Ahtu and</p><p> To-wee sat stoically silent in the bow. All</p><p> at once Charlie dropped the oars and stood</p><p> erect. He was much affected, for tmce he</p><p> started to call to his Indian wife, and twice</p><p> his voice broke. “Tell her, Ahtu, that I am</p><p> coming back to her, to stay,” said Charlie</p><p> in a choked voice. Ahtu stood up, and</p><p> putting his hands to his mouth, gave a</p><p> peculiar call. Both women were at once</p><p> silent, listening with strained attention.</p><p> Ahtu now called to,.the women that</p><p>Charlie said he would surely come back to </p><p>Ma-hat-m! and that when he came back, it </p><p>' WOld b'e to stay. </p><p> Ma-hat-mi now ran into the water and</p><p> cried out joyfully: “Charlow say come</p><p> back. Charlow no lie; him come, me wait! ”</p><p> She then turned back to Ahtu’s wife and</p><p> began to comfort her. An hour later all the</p><p> small black specks on the beach climbed the</p><p> face of the cliff and disappeared.</p><p> Jan. 14—We are unable to find the good</p><p> bank of pearls. We have cruised as far</p><p> south as the Animas and San Lorenzo Is-</p><p> lands, yet have taken only ten inferior</p><p> pearls. The pearl oysters are plentiful, but</p><p> they are fat and hearty. To-we6 took a</p><p> fine pearl yesterday, a blue-black one, worth</p><p> perhaps $200. We are going to look for a</p><p> harbor on the east side of San Lorenzo Island,</p><p> hoping that on the reefs we may do better.</p><p>286 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Jan. 15—To-day Charlie made a kill on</p><p> a large shark—4 la Kanaka. We were an-</p><p> chored over a reef and Ahtu, To-wee and</p><p> myself were diving for the shells, while</p><p> Charlie was opening them. The rocks of the</p><p> reef were thick with shells, yet they were</p><p> depressingly healthy and hence free from</p><p> poftl. Ahtu and I sat naked on the bow,</p><p> taking a blow and rest, when To-wee dived</p><p> for the rocks underneath. We saw his</p><p> streak” go down to the bottom. Charlie</p><p> tat naked, smoking and opening the pearls</p><p> with a long knife. All at once he spit out</p><p> his pipe and dived for the boy. I then saw</p><p> She shark. I grabbed a harpoon and poised</p><p> it for a throw, but before I could cast,</p><p> Charlie was alongside the shark’s upturned</p><p> ! belly. I saw a sudden whorl under the</p><p> water, then the shark shot up into the air,</p><p> with a great rip in his belly. To-wee and</p><p> Charlie came up together, the first sputter-</p><p> ing with fear, the latter cursing because his</p><p> pipe had gone overboard.</p><p> “The-pipe is black,” said Charlie.</p><p> “The-reef is also black, now it vill be</p><p> ---to fine dat pipe!”</p><p> Well, after repeated dips we found it, but</p><p> we took no more shell that day.</p><p> Tbfitfhell of the pearl-oyster is from four</p><p> to seven inb.es across. The base or hinge</p><p> of the shell is a’at, straight line, from which</p><p> ihe body of the she’Jaulges like three quar-</p><p> ters of a full moon. The pearl is found</p><p> either in the stomach of he oyster or in its</p><p> outer feeding-fringe. In te first case the</p><p> pearl is likely to be large andustrous; in the</p><p> latter, small aid &amp; less meat, Not over</p><p> one pearl in a humred has a nape perfect</p><p> enough to give it much value. At one side</p><p> of the “hinge” a tuft of coarse hora&amp;ua..</p><p> like tentacle protrudes from the inside of the</p><p> shell. It is with this coarse hair-like ten-</p><p> tacle that the oyster adheres to his native</p><p> rocks. A large oyster will test the strength</p><p> of a strong man to dislodge his hold; a sud-</p><p> den, quick jerk will do the job, however, so</p><p> soon as the knack of jerking under water is</p><p> learned. There are tricks in all trades, even</p><p> under the water.</p><p> Jan. 16—We took a hunt to-day on San</p><p> Lorenzo Island. As Pete Kitchen says, “It</p><p> was chiefly a hunt—and a-pore ketch! ”</p><p> A few seagulls gave us a mournful ha-ha as</p><p> we passed them. Outside of this, it was</p><p> chiefly a rattlesnake hunt. The island is</p><p> full of them, and how they got there is a job</p><p> for a Philadelphia lawyer. Either they</p><p>“must ’a’ swum,” or the island was once </p><p>part of the mainland. “Saint Pathrick” is </p><p>badly needed on San Lorenzo. Once clear </p><p>of snakes, it would make a great place for </p><p>an Irish picnic, and an Orange-Catholic </p><p>affair of great spirit could be arranged, if </p><p>“hand-sized” rocks mean anything. After </p><p>due reflection, I withdraw the above, as </p><p>whisky is as scarce as true charity between </p><p>society ladies. Coming back, we found an </p><p>old camp and some human bones. From the </p><p>gold-filling in the teeth of the skull we </p><p>thought it must be the skull of a white man. </p><p>Poor devil, I suppose a rattler bit him. </p><p> Jan. 21—We have had four dreadful days</p><p>of rain and wind. Time after time I thought </p><p>we were gone and, but for Charlie’s fine sea- </p><p>manship and our faithful bailing, we should </p><p>be with the fishes. We have four lives and </p><p>$29,000 in gold aboard, so it would be a </p><p>double pity to swamp in a storm. I am </p><p>tired beyond words! </p><p> Jan. 22—We are short of drinking water.</p><p>The storm battered our water-cans until </p><p>some of them have holes in them. We have </p><p>only four great cans that are still water- </p><p>tight. We are now four drinkers in’ lieu of </p><p>two. The storm blew us across the Gulf and </p><p>left us at the southern end of Tiburon Island. </p><p>We are now beating up the channel between </p><p>the island and the Sonora coast. The wind </p><p>is good, but a fierce tide is running against </p><p>us, so tiiat for the last few hours we are at </p><p>a standstill. If the wind holds, we ought to </p><p>get north like an express, when the tide </p><p>changes our way. </p><p> We have seen several Seri Indians, who</p><p>seem to be watching us from the cliffs of </p><p>their island. Ahtu declares that-*\.nese In- </p><p>dians ar&amp;&lt;ranafhL)ki5 an'u'mat they are treach- </p><p>erous and cruel beyond words. This is un- </p><p>fortunate news, since we are compelled to </p><p>land on the north end of the island for water. </p><p>The chart shows no other water within one </p><p>hundred miles, so we must take the risk. If </p><p>they buzz around us too close, we will try </p><p>some of Dr. Colt’s and Dr. Winchester’s</p><p>pills on them. </p><p> Jan. 24—We are now exactly opposite the</p><p>spot where the chart shows fresh water. </p><p>We have also divided the last sup of water, </p><p>at breakfast. We held a council of war and </p><p>decided to land for water and take chances. </p><p>We can’t get back to the coast of Lower </p><p>California at Vistado Bay, for the wind is </p><p>dead in the west. If we keep on north for </p><p>the Colorado River, a change of wind may </p><p>Adventuring in Tiburon </p><p>287 </p><p>become a head-wind and so cause us to </p><p>perish of thirst. So we have resolved to </p><p>land, since we might as well die fighting as </p><p>die of thirst. Ahtu has just seen a squaw </p><p>come out of a clump of brush with a water- </p><p>ed on her head. This may be a decoy to </p><p>lead us into a trap. Anyway, here goes— </p><p>for water or a row, or water and a row! </p><p>Jan. 25—Well, we had the row! </p><p>Ahtu has two bullet-wounds, one in </p><p>the flesh of the shoulder and a glanc- </p><p>ing shot in the head. I think his skull is </p><p>very hard. Charlie is shot twice in the </p><p>same leg. If God ever made a brave and </p><p>devoted man, Ahtu is one! Here is how it </p><p>happened: Ahtu and I being the best </p><p>shots, we acted as guards for To-we6 and </p><p>Charlie, who were hurriedly to fill the cans. </p><p>Ahtu took the 30-40 and I took the 25-35. </p><p> We waded ashore and each took a high</p><p>knoll of sand on either side of the water- </p><p>hole. Seeing no Seri Indians, we waved for </p><p>Charlie and To-we6 to come on with the </p><p>cans. Charlie carried two of the good five- </p><p>gallon cans and the 30-30 carbine. To-wee </p><p>came behind him with the other two good </p><p>cans and the three canteens. He also </p><p>brought an iron pot to fill with. To-wee </p><p>was unarmed. </p><p> Just as Charlie and To-wee began to fill</p><p>the'cans, we Vere fired on by concealed </p><p>Sens, who lay ^ SOme scrub brush about one </p><p>hundred yards away. Ahtu called to me </p><p>to watch on my right. I turned just in time </p><p>to see a big Seri buck aiming at me—not </p><p>over thirty yards away. I ducked as he </p><p>fired, then shot him in the mouth. He fell </p><p>flat at the shot, lying sprawled on the sand, </p><p>with the whole back of his head blown out </p><p>by the bullet. To-wee shouted and, run- </p><p>ning over amid a shower of bullets, got his </p><p>gun—a .44 Winchester carbine. Seeing this, </p><p>the Serfs yelled and rushed us, losing four </p><p>more men. In this rush they wounded Ahtu </p><p>in the shoulder and Charlie in the right leg. </p><p> When the Serfs broke for cover Charlie</p><p>and To-wee began hastily filling the cans. </p><p>Just as these were nearly full, they began </p><p>yelling again and opened a hot fire. This </p><p>time they broke Charlie’s wounded leg with </p><p>another shot. We could see numbers of the </p><p>Indians hastening down from the high </p><p>ground to reenforce those who were engaged </p><p>with us. To-wee now ran to the boat with </p><p>two full cans and returned for more. Char- </p><p>lie was unable to stand, but sat grimly on </p><p>the sand, pumping lead at the brush. To- </p><p>we6 now secured the other two cans and </p><p>again ran for the boat. </p><p> This left Charlie and three full canteens</p><p>at the spring. Seeing that Charlie could </p><p>not walk, Ahtu ran down, shouldered Char- </p><p>lie, took up the three canteens and stared </p><p>staggering for the boat. At this the Sfclis </p><p>rushed again, yelling and firing like devils. </p><p>Ahtu now set Charlie down on the sand and </p><p>both men began firing on the Serfs. AhUr * </p><p>was now struck in the head, falling to the </p><p>ground. I ran from my knoll to succor the </p><p>two men on the ground, but before I got </p><p>there Ahtu rose up and killed the nearest. </p><p>Seri. I here upset two Serfs in succession, </p><p>and they again broke for cover. </p><p> Ahtu picked up Charlie once more, while</p><p>I took the three canteens. Thus we reached </p><p>the boat and put out under a heavy fire </p><p>from the brush. To-wee and I now set the </p><p>mainsail and we were soon out of range. I </p><p>gave To-wee the tiller and began to look </p><p>after the wounded. I tore up two shirts, </p><p>bandaged Charlie’s bleeding leg and made </p><p>him as comfortable as I could. Ahtu had </p><p>fainted from loss of blood and his heroic over- </p><p>exertion, but I gave him some hot coffee and </p><p>this brought him to. As I bathed, ar.l1 </p><p>dag^iiwuncls I saw hir. w'eakly smiling. </p><p>“ What in the-are you grinning about? ” </p><p>I asked him. </p><p> “We killed many of them and we are all</p><p>alive,” he answered. </p><p> To-we6 was the most dejected man of the</p><p>lot. A perverse demon seemed to have </p><p>entered his savage sou',. At supper he </p><p>refused to eat. “What is the matter with </p><p>you? ” I asked. He replied that he was an </p><p>old squaw, since he had not slain an enemy. </p><p>He deplored the fact that he did not know </p><p>how to hit with a rifle. “Had I had my </p><p>bow and quiver of arrows, 1 could tell a </p><p>better story!” said he. I first chided him, </p><p>then complimented him on his valor, saying </p><p>that but for his coolness and devotion to </p><p>duty we would all have been slain. At this </p><p>he brightened up and ate a hearty meal.</p><p>Jan. 26 — Ahtu is much better. </p><p>Youth and a stout heart are helping </p><p>him recover at a bound. His wounds </p><p>were only flesh-wounds and, while he is </p><p>weak and a bit feverish, he is getting well </p><p>fast. I am wetting the bandages of both </p><p>men with sea-water; though salt and pain- </p><p>ful; I believe it does their wounds good. </p><p>288 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Charlie is in great pain, and is slightly de- </p><p>lirious at times. I am afraid that his age </p><p>and severe wounds are going to give him a </p><p>hard rub, so I am much distressed, for old </p><p>Charlie is a fine man. This morning To-we6 </p><p>said that if I would land on the Sonora coast, </p><p>he would get good medicine. He was gone </p><p>inland about an hour, returning with a </p><p>squat, fleshy shrub which we pounded up </p><p>and applied to the wounds. We also made </p><p>tea of it and gave it to them to drink. It </p><p>seemed to refresh them very much, espe- </p><p>cially Charlie. </p><p> Jan. 30—I have been too busy and tired</p><p>to write much diary. Ahtu, while still </p><p>weak and sore, is otherwise well. I tend </p><p>Charlie constantly, for he is very ill. He is </p><p>out of his head most of the time. At such </p><p>limes he talks Kanaka, of which we can not </p><p>understand a word. If his wounds don’t </p><p>gangrene, I think we are going to save him. </p><p>The wind is from the northwest and we are </p><p>making slow but steady progress for the </p><p>mouth of the Colorado. A storm now </p><p>would be fatal to poor Charlie. We have re- </p><p>filled the cans from a swamp near the beach. </p><p>We boil this water and it is drinkable. </p><p> Feb. 2—No sign of gangrene yet. He has</p><p>iesr. fever^han any day this week. I believe </p><p>he is going to live and I am overjoyed ac- </p><p>cordingly. Ahtu now "takes his turn at </p><p>tilings and this lightens my load so that I can </p><p>get a little sleep. To-wee is a fine boy, but </p><p>there is no one like Ahtu, for he is a man— </p><p>a MAN! The wind has shifted to the south- </p><p>west and we are making great headway. </p><p>We ought to sight Montague Island to- </p><p>night or in the morning. </p><p> Feb. 3—We are now, thank the Lord, safe</p><p>and sound in Shipyard Slough, and have </p><p>plenty of water to drink! Charlie is per- </p><p>fectly clear-headed, but very weak. Poor </p><p>devil, he has suffered the tortures of the </p><p>damned, but he is a game old cock and takes </p><p>his medicine like a stoic. He says that his </p><p>leg is numb, so we rub it gently every few </p><p>hours. I am sending To-wee with the skiff </p><p>to try to find old Dominguez’s ranch. The</p><p>sloughs are many and crooked, but if he has </p><p>luck, he may stumble on the right one. I </p><p>have warned him about the bore or tide-rip, </p><p>so that he won’t get caught and drowned. </p><p> Feb. 4—To-wee is back, but could not find</p><p>the ranch. Ahtu will look after Charlie </p><p>to-morrow, while To-wee and I have an- </p><p>other try for the ranch. I wonder if the </p><p>Burkes made it across on foot, burdened as </p><p> they were with bed-roll and rifles? One</p><p> wrong step in the bottomless mud of one of</p><p> these sloughs would preserve one for future</p><p> ages of geologists. They could then argue</p><p> even more than the present day wiseacres;</p><p> they might class Frank Burke’s skull as</p><p> neolithic or paleolithic, but Pete’s would</p><p> come under the class of plain “bone-head.’'</p><p> Frank insisted that he knew the tide-flats</p><p> and if that was true, the chances are that he</p><p> made it all 0. K.</p><p> Feb. 5—We are just back from the ranch.</p><p> Old Dominguez is a kind old sow, but he is</p><p> the-est liar this side of Hades. Most</p><p> Greasers are natural born liars, but old</p><p> Dominguez is a liar by heredity, education,</p><p> practise, inclination, general principles and</p><p> mendicitis! He props his fat belly up in</p><p> the shade and starts early in the morning.</p><p> He knows where there are tons of “buried</p><p> treasure.” He has the cinch on “ lostmines ”</p><p> that are pure gold—each vein being a mile</p><p> wide and an inch long! Well, anyway,</p><p> I bought a bottle of brandy from him,</p><p> some milk and some sagu. This ought to</p><p> strengthen old Charlie wonderfully.</p><p> A Cocopah Indian at the ranch told me</p><p> that Frank Burke was dead, and that</p><p> __&lt;Pete was now Town Marshall of Yuma.</p><p> He said also that it was rumored in Yuma</p><p> that Charlie and I had been drowned by the</p><p> bore. Charlie and I are not drowned by a</p><p> -sight. He may wind up shy a leg, but</p><p> he has a fine stake of gold to keep him and,</p><p> if he needs it, he can have my share as well</p><p> as his own. Dominguez says that a young</p><p> New York doctor is up in the bottoms, hunt-</p><p> ing for deer. I have sent the Cocopah with 0</p><p> letter, begging him to come down and at-</p><p> tend to Charlie.</p><p> Feb. 7—The doctor ' was not a doctor.</p><p> He was ah unfortunate Tenderfoot “ lunger,”</p><p> out here trying to prolong his consumpted</p><p> life a few more years. Old Dominguez had</p><p> seen his cartload of medicine bottles and</p><p> had drawn his usual correct conclusion. If</p><p> he should ever happen to tell the truth it</p><p> would be instantly fatal to him.</p><p> We have sent over to the nearest Cocopah</p><p> village, to hire four bucks to row and tow us</p><p> up to Yuma. It will be-going through</p><p> the mosquito-belt the next few days. Com-</p><p> ing down-stream with the current and every-</p><p> body well and hearty is very different from</p><p> bucking the river with a sick man.</p><p> Feb. 8—The four Cocopah, bucks are here.</p><p> We are to feed them and pay them twenty-</p><p>Adventuring in Tiburon </p><p>289 </p><p> five dollars for the trip. They say that they</p><p> can make it in four days. As there is a</p><p> strong wind blowing in from the Gulf, I</p><p> think it will be wise to sail up as far as we</p><p> can. Charlie seems morally encouraged at</p><p> his nearness to a good doctor. One of the</p><p> wounds is well. The other is continually</p><p> suppurating, and his leg pains him all the</p><p> time. He has had a hard time, with three</p><p> rude but willing nurses. We are all cheer-</p><p> Sul and hoping the best for him.</p><p> Feb. 10—We are now more than half way</p><p>up to Yuma. I sent a runner to Yuma to </p><p>get a doctor to meet us at La Grulla. If he </p><p>comes, we wall take him aboard and send </p><p>his horse back by the Indian runner. The </p><p>mosquitoes are very bad; our faces are bitten </p><p>terribly. These naked Indians do not seem </p><p>to mind them in the least and their skins are </p><p>as tough as bull-hide. Our best relief from </p><p>the mosquitoes is obtained by daubing our </p><p>hands and faces with a thick layer of soft </p><p>river-mud. This seems either to fool them, </p><p>or their bills can not reach through to the </p><p>skin. This towing up-stream is slow and </p><p>irksome traveling. A little more patience! </p><p>Feb. 11—Doctor Heffernan is here! </p><p>He says that Charlie’s leg will have </p><p>to be operated on. He has sand and </p><p>pieces of broken bone is the'woysd and they </p><p>must be removed. lie thinks the leg will be </p><p>ssved, afchough Charlie will always have a </p><p>slight limp. Charlie is pleased that he </p><p>won’t lose the leg and says that a “Limpy is </p><p>better than a Peg-leg.” </p><p> Ahtu to-day licked one of the Cocopah</p><p>bucks, because of a fancied disrespect to me. </p><p>The Cocopah buck was grinning and making </p><p>what Ahtu considered insulting gestures in </p><p>my direction. Quick as a flash Ahtu was </p><p>at him with a stick of driftwood, knocking </p><p>him silly with a terrific blow. I stopped the </p><p>row and, when explanations were made, it </p><p>turned out that the Indian was describing </p><p>a row he had had with another Cocopah </p><p>some months before. I scolded Ahtu for </p><p>overzealousness, gave the Cocopah a dollar </p><p>and so salved the broken peace.</p><p> Feb. 13—Yuma at last! The boys all</p><p>came down to greet the wanderers and lend </p><p>a helping hand. Shaunnessy came in person </p><p>and brought a felicitous quart, which, being </p><p>“mountain dew,” lasted the crowd about as </p><p>long as a puff of smoke. Charlie was car- </p><p>ried up to the hospital, and the many sympa- </p><p>thizing friends were not thinned out by the </p><p>sight of the bags of gold-dust. We de- </p><p>posited this at the express office and cleaned </p><p>up for a restful loaf. Money is a great thing </p><p>to tune the human heart to lively sympathy </p><p>—with the possessor. This may sound like </p><p>cynicism—yet I have ever noted that the </p><p>sorrows of the unfortunate poor are likelyjlo </p><p>fall on dull ears. </p><p> Ahtu and To-wee were the recipients of</p><p>much kindly curiosity, which, as I saw it </p><p>offended Ahtu, I firmly put a stop to. He* </p><p>To-wee and I are to live together in my old </p><p>dobe shack, in easy reach of the hospital. </p><p>The old Santa Maria was hauled up on the </p><p>bank for a coat of paint and a general fixing </p><p>up. She is a stanch boat and can stand </p><p>many another trip down the river. </p><p> Mar. 10—I went down this morning to</p><p>see them off. The Santa Maria was loaded </p><p>down to the guards with grub and presents </p><p>for Tomas, Ma-hat-ml, Mrs. Ahtu and the </p><p>rest of the Simangitos. Ahtu has refused </p><p>food these last two days and has cut off his </p><p>hair, in sign of mourning at leaving me! I </p><p>have promised him that “some day” I will </p><p>come and pay him another visit. To-we6 </p><p>has two new rifles and cartridges galore. He </p><p>is all fuss and fine feathers—a perfect pea- </p><p>cock of a dandy. He boasted to me that if </p><p>ne ever fpught again, he wou/d “shoot kill’ </p><p>many.” The young ladies of the Simangi- </p><p>tos may now prepare for the heartache, </p><p>since this proud young savage is becoming a </p><p>gay Lothario. </p><p> Charlie is entirely well, save for a slight</p><p>limp that he will always have to remind him </p><p>of Tiburon. He said to jpe, “Jack, I now </p><p>pretty soon been old. I never go back to </p><p>Honolulu. Ma-hat-ml a good vooman an’ 1 </p><p>lak her plenty.” </p><p> I am sorely tempted to drop all else and</p><p>go with them—but I am of another race and </p><p>another world of men. An occasional, lapse </p><p>back into primitive life is good for the soul, </p><p>however, and “some day,” if God is willing, </p><p>I	will go to them for a time.</p><p> The parting from Ahtu is a bitter thing</p><p>for me. Sophists may assert that there can </p><p>be no true love and sympathy between the </p><p>Indian and the Anglo-Saxon. That this is</p><p>untrue is proved by the great affection and </p><p>perfect trust between this savage youth and </p><p>myself. Under the dark skin of this primi- </p><p>tive man dwells a soul that is truth itself, </p><p>and between this soul and mine own there is </p><p>a bond of love—strong as the Promise of </p><p>God. May God go with them! </p><p>DE </p><p>B Y </p><p>^ENNY THE RAT was broke. </p><p>Grogan, his erstwhile friend and </p><p>sharer in many illicit spoils, had </p><p>kicked him out of his saloon </p><p>when he asked for a drink. And Mike </p><p>Sweeny, his brother-in-law, proprietor of </p><p>a doubtful hotel where bed could be had </p><p>for five, ten and fifteen cents, had refused </p><p>him shelter. iHis shoes had great reas in • </p><p>them through which trie water sloshed in </p><p>and out, and the crown of his limp black </p><p>hat, several sizes too large for him, occasion- </p><p>ally overflowed, sending a cascade of dirty, </p><p>black water down his back. </p><p> Never in all his years along the water-</p><p>front could he remember when there was </p><p>not at least one drunk to be “rolled,” but </p><p>now even this was denied him. No vinous </p><p>sailor-man staggered into his snares, pedes- </p><p>trians kept their coats tightly buttoned </p><p>over illusive gleams of gold watches, even </p><p>shop-girls hurrying down gloomy streets </p><p>displayed no gaudy, jingling purses. Fate </p><p>made sport of the wise one, the biter was </p><p>bitten, the hunter hunted; Denny was </p><p>broke. </p><p> Out of the darkness a blue-coated arm</p><p>suddenly shot; fingers clutched his shoulder. </p><p>The arm belonged to Billy McShane, the </p><p>fingers to a hand he had many times crossed </p><p>with pieces of silver. This time the hand </p><p>was not greedy, but was the embodiment </p><p>of the law—of all that was fearful, of a </p><p>black wagon, of clanging doors, of bars and </p><p>brutal treatment. </p><p> Denny wiggled away with a convulsive</p><p>RAT </p><p>I G H T </p><p>movement, leaving a goodly portion of his </p><p>coat with the officer. Half-way across the </p><p>street he paused to heap upon the offend- </p><p>ing head all the choice assortment of vile- </p><p>ness he had picked up in his thirty-odd </p><p>years. Billy McShane waved a friendly </p><p>hand and nodded. Some day the Rat </p><p>would pay for this, they both knew it, and, </p><p>worked up to a frenzy of fear and hatred, </p><p>Denny* ,xmvtinivu*- to express his opinion of </p><p>the other until, thinking tile .joke had gone</p><p>far enough, the policeman raised hiS wiiisue </p><p>to his lips. With that Denny vanished. </p><p> Seated in an alley where the raindrops</p><p>seemed neither so large nor so cold, he took </p><p>counsel with himself. Then, as fully born </p><p>as Venus from her sea-foam, an idea sprang </p><p>into his mind. </p><p> Under its watery dirt his face paled a</p><p>trifle; what he was about to do was a brave </p><p>thing. Many men who did not deserve the </p><p>appellation of Rat, or whose eyes were not </p><p>set so close together, would have hesitated; </p><p>but for the moment, between the gnawing </p><p>at his belly and the goose-flesh on his skin, </p><p>he was no longer the timid scavenger whc </p><p>pokes his nose fearfully about in the dark. </p><p>That part of his nature which craved food, </p><p>tobacco, alcohol, was in the ascendency. </p><p>He turned the project carefully ;over in his </p><p>mind; then, rising quickly, made his way </p><p>to Grogan’s saloon. </p><p> The barkeeper was in the act of drink-</p><p>ing a glass at a hospitable stranger’s ex- </p><p>pense. He paused to glare angrily at the </p><p>intruder. </p><p>THE </p><p>G </p><p>290 </p><p>Denny the Rat </p><p>291 </p><p> “Back again?” he snarled, reaching for</p><p>ihe bung-starter. At any other time Denny </p><p>would have fled, but for the present he was </p><p>completely obsessed with his great idea. </p><p>With his hand he made a motion well un- </p><p>derstood between the two. The barkeeper </p><p>gave in sullenly, as if sorry to lose the op- </p><p>portunity of using his weapon. The thief </p><p>slipped quietly into a back room. After a </p><p>long time the garrulous stranger finished </p><p>his drink and departed. Denny drew a </p><p>deep breath and eyed the barkeeper stonily </p><p>across the sloppy table. </p><p> “Gimme a poice o’ poiper—none o’</p><p>ye’re dirty pad, cully—an enwelop and a </p><p>stamp. Now chase yerself; this is me busy </p><p>day!” </p><p> Grogan’s night helper rose reluctantly.</p><p>This was not the man he knew. Come to </p><p>bully, he found himself relegated to the </p><p>position of servant; nevertheless he went. </p><p>Such is the dominance of a splendid con- </p><p>ception. ( </p><p> The material at hand, the Rat wrote</p><p>with many blotches, laborious lip-spelling </p><p>of words, and hunching of elbows. With </p><p>his letter finally finished, safe in the en- </p><p>velope and addressed, he rose to face the</p><p>bartender leaning over his shoulder. That </p><p>worthy stretched out a soft, white hand. </p><p> “Come in and have a dram,” he said,</p><p>“and I’ll wrap you up a pint.” </p><p> “Where youse goin’ to stay?” he asked</p><p>when the drink was gone. “Now, I’ve got </p><p>a cot,” he added tentatively; “if you </p><p>think-” And the Rat said he did think, </p><p>in rather a bored tone, for he was still under </p><p>the spell of his great idea. </p><p>BY THE time Denny awoke on his </p><p>bravely earned cot the missive was </p><p>in the hands of the Chief of Police. </p><p>And, while it may have caused intense ex- </p><p>citement in that individual’s pouter-pigeon </p><p>breast, he displayed no undue elation. Graft </p><p>is a delicate thing, a butterfly whose gold- </p><p>powdered wings must be brushed ever so </p><p>gently. The Chief, therefore, having pon- </p><p>dered long and thoughtfully, pushed a but- </p><p>ton and gave a careless order. Affairs of </p><p>importance should be hid under a bushel. </p><p> A little later Denny, somewhat tremulous</p><p>at having to invade this holy of holies, en- </p><p>tered. The night’s rest had not done him </p><p>good. Twelve hours of contemplation had </p><p>weakened his nerve, for the deed he was </p><p>about to do sat uncomfortably upon his </p><p>cowardly nature. He sidled crabwise to a </p><p>chair and, clutching his limp, black hat, </p><p>watched the Chief’s movements appre- </p><p>hensively. The latter, without looking up, </p><p>passed him the letter to read. </p><p> Denny, in a quavering voice, began.</p><p> He wondered greatly at himself—where he,</p><p> a robber of drunks, snatcher of womens</p><p> purses, purloiner of fat men’s watches, ever</p><p> conceived the hardihood to formulate such</p><p> a plan.</p><p> The Chief’s attitude toward him had as</p><p> subtly changed as had the barkeeper’s.</p><p> There was just a spark of contempt in his</p><p> eyes where Denny had been accustomed to</p><p> find a blaze. Also—which- warmed the</p><p> cockles of his heart—there was a little hint</p><p> of respect, which he thought due him now</p><p> he was in a fair way of becoming a desper-</p><p> ate character. Alas, Denny, it was only</p><p> the fear of rubbing the dust from the but-</p><p> terfly’s wings!</p><p> However, not being given to self-analysis,</p><p> his chest took on an arch not unlike the-</p><p> Chief’s own. He felt that fate, so long ad-</p><p> verse, was beginning to relent</p><p> The note read something like this:</p><p> Honored Sir—Yu kant find who has wrote thi?</p><p> unjes-y&amp;u.gimme yure word not to prose'-"»p fer past</p><p> -■'offenses.	tried tC jiuii me last night as a</p><p> vag, also I’m wanted on a charge of dipping, gim-</p><p> me a clean bill an 111 put yu wise on how to katch</p><p> Larry Lackmore. we done several jobs together</p><p> and got another framed up.

The</p><p> agreement having reached a point where, as</p><p> the law has it, “ there is a meeting of minds,”</p><p> they proceeded amicably.</p><p>II </p><p>LARRY LACKMORE, as he was </p><p>known at that time, was a peculiar </p><p>if not eccentric character. Bom of </p><p>rich and influential parents, he chose vol- </p><p>untarily to espouse a career of crime, and, </p><p>strange as it may seem, his success in this </p><p>292 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>new line of endeavor had been even </p><p>greater than that he had achieved as </p><p>a cotillion leader. He was a thorn in </p><p>the side of the police of two continents </p><p>—an irritating thom which not only </p><p>refused to be removed but which gave </p><p>notice every time it was going to rob </p><p>the social body of a bit of its precious </p><p>cuticle. </p><p> Instead of eschewing the light, Larry</p><p>seemed to take a malicious delight in turn- </p><p>ing his tricks under the sun of public no- </p><p>tice. He invariably warned his victims, a </p><p>detail which in no wise interfered with his </p><p>getting what he went after. Many people </p><p>laid this down to an inordinate vanity </p><p>and predicted his speedy capture. Larry </p><p>claimed it was the one straight rule in a </p><p>crooked game. </p><p> At first the public howled while the police</p><p>raved. To the country at large it was a </p><p>tremendous joke on the thick-headed min- </p><p>ions of the law. Larry slipped through all </p><p>the traps set for him like a greased pig at a </p><p>country picnic. </p><p> There was one more tiring which should</p><p>have made Larry an easy capture. For </p><p>every operation that netted him a clear </p><p>ten thousand dollars he changed his name. </p><p>rhesg	were alluring allitefStfoBS.;</p><p>The Byrd diamonds had - disappeared from</p><p>their resting-place in the vault by the aid </p><p>of Adair Atkinson. The Commercial Se- </p><p>curity Company had been filched under </p><p>the name of Bamaby Blackstone. Denny </p><p>had assisted one Culberson Crothers in the </p><p>matter of a few old paintings. According </p><p>to Larry, it was a short cut to bookkeep- </p><p>ing. He had only to count how many </p><p>letters his name was from “A,” multiply </p><p>it by ten and he had the number of thou- </p><p>sands he possessed. Anything over the </p><p>len-thousand limit and the results of his </p><p>smaller operations went for cigarettes and </p><p>tips. </p><p> By counting from “A” to “L” you get</p><p>the figure twelve. It is thus easy to see </p><p>that Larry was on velvet to the extent of </p><p>one hundred and twenty thousand dollars. </p><p>The public, being able to solve this simple </p><p>problem, arrived at the same conclusion. </p><p>Their howls of laughter changed to roars </p><p>of rage and like a thunderstorm on a high </p><p>peak the conflict raged about the Chief of </p><p>Police. No wonder, then, the grimy little </p><p>sneak thief appeared to him in the guise </p><p>of an angel. </p><p> LARRY was again in need of assist-</p><p> ance and, being by nature a master-</p><p> ful man, preferred that his helper</p><p> should be as feeble an instrument as pos-</p><p> sible. To this end he turned to the Rat,</p><p> on whose unquestioned obedience he was</p><p> depending.</p><p> In the Holland House every afternoon a</p><p> very rich and very stingy old man could</p><p> always be found. His name doesn’t mat-</p><p> ter—we will call him the millionaire. In</p><p> a way he, too, was nature-twisted. His</p><p> money had been made by sly schemes,</p><p> broken promises, betrayed friendships. His</p><p> skating on the ice of the law had been</p><p> wrong but not illegal. A writ had no ter-</p><p> rors for him, but something else had. His</p><p> conscience made him fearful of others, so</p><p> it was that the remark of a casual stranger</p><p> would send him back into his shell like a</p><p> frightened mud-turtle.</p><p> He had only one failing. There reposed,</p><p> always in his pocket, like an amulet, a</p><p> thick leather wallet, and rumor had it that</p><p> this never contained a less amount than</p><p> the sum necessary for Larry to choose an-</p><p> other alias.</p><p> How the plan was to be worked the Rai</p><p> had not been told. Dressed as a chauffeur,</p><p> on the drop of a handkerchief he was to</p><p> ■“ilifean Mr. Lackmore that the car was wait-</p><p> ing. The two, millionaire and burglar,</p><p> would leave the hotel, arm in arm; they</p><p> would be driven far out in the country.</p><p> Here, on some pretext, he was to leave</p><p> them. For this the Rat was to receive</p><p> two hundred dollars. But this was the fly</p><p> in the ointment. The money hinged on the</p><p> contingency of the plan’s being successful.</p><p> Denny had some improvements to offer.</p><p> Instead of taking the direct route to the</p><p> country he would circle around by the</p><p> police station. It was then a simple matter</p><p> for him to toot his horn and jam on the</p><p> brakes. The rest of the performance inter-</p><p> ested him little.</p><p> Out in the sunlight, with the crisp rustle</p><p> of bills in his pocket, the Rat sighed almost</p><p> happily. What danger could there be?</p><p> For once he was with the law, not against</p><p> it. Its forces were at his back to help.</p><p> Even Billy McShane lost something of his</p><p> fearful aspect. The Chief had assured him</p><p> that Larry would get at least twenty-five</p><p> years, and what might not happen in</p><p> twenty-five Summers and Winters?</p><p> He had long had his eye on a little to-</p><p>Denny the Rat </p><p>293 </p><p> bacco-shop. The five hundred would make</p><p> ‘ it his, and then there was a girl. Even if</p><p> she hated him, she was a good girl and</p><p> would obey her mother. Mercury, pro-</p><p> tector of nimble-fingered rogues, enveloped</p><p> his head in rosy clouds.</p><p>Ill </p><p> IN THE Holland House one after-</p><p> noon two gentlemen were seated</p><p> side by side. They were evidently</p><p> strangers, for they did not speak. Pres-</p><p> ently the younger one, after puffing sev-</p><p> eral times on a dead cigar, asked his</p><p> neighbor for a light. The millionaire, for</p><p> it was he, smiled disagreeably and was</p><p> about to refuse, but somehow he didn’t.</p><p> He searched in his pocket and brought</p><p> forth a dirty little pine stick with just a</p><p> tinge of red on one end. It was not much</p><p> of a match as matches go. In the pocket</p><p> of a millionaire it was a crying offense.</p><p> As might have been expected, the match</p><p> flickered feebly and went out. The younger</p><p> man turned around and talked. His words</p><p> were not such as the Holland House is ac-</p><p> customed to hear. They were not directed</p><p> toward the unoffending lucifer, but toward</p><p> the man who would carry such a-article.</p><p> Larry then stalked solemnly to the cigar-</p><p> stand, lighted his cigar and returned to his</p><p> seat.</p><p> The millionaire was charmed. He had</p><p> never had any one talk to him like that.</p><p> To his mind it represented the quintessence</p><p> of what he most desired—disinterestedness.</p><p> The words themselves fell from his back</p><p> like water from a duck’s. Like Achilles, he</p><p> had only the one vulnerable spot, and his</p><p> heel was in his pocketbook. At last he</p><p> had found a man who wanted nothing.</p><p> This was no beggar for a philanthropic</p><p> cause, no soft-voiced confidence man!</p><p> An apology for the match, and the two</p><p> Jell into conversation. The millionaire had</p><p> a hobby, like most of us. Two, in fact—</p><p> books and municipal improvements. He</p><p> thought every city s”hould be beautiful.</p><p> To this end he would abolish the ugly.</p><p> The poor and ugly going together, he would</p><p> abolish the poor likewise. The laboring</p><p> class could be allowed to enter the city at</p><p> daybreak. Having done their work, they</p><p> should be driven out.</p><p> Larry, while hating him, agreed. He</p><p> went one step further; he thought all poor</p><p>should be isolated in some sort of colony </p><p>such as lepers have. This idea met with </p><p>the millionaire’s instant approval. </p><p> Over a cocktail they talked of books—</p><p>Larry paying for the drinks and showing </p><p>a vaster knowledge than the millionaire’s </p><p>own. Toward'the close of the afternoon </p><p>they had another drink and some cigars </p><p>for which the millionaire was too slow in </p><p>finding his change. The Rat, transformed </p><p>into a monkey, stiffly informed Larry that </p><p>“de car was woitin’.” Larry graciously </p><p>offered the millionaire a lift. The mil- </p><p>lionaire as gracefully accepted. It was </p><p>something for nothing; why not? </p><p> In the luxury of the car, Larry momen-</p><p>tarily allowed former suspicions to be lulled </p><p>to rest; it had seemed too easy. Like </p><p>many successful young men, he was too </p><p>prone to self-confidence. He forgot his </p><p>own teaching—in time of greatest ap- </p><p>parent security to be most vigilant. But </p><p>his eyes ached from the study of civil im- </p><p>provement; the Spring air was soft and </p><p>balmy, holding more than a hint of radiant </p><p>Summer; the macadam smelled as though </p><p>freshly boiled; the car scarcely bounced </p><p>at all; the millionaire’s raucous voice </p><p>seemed softened a little. He would be very </p><p>gentle with the old man when he took his </p><p>money. </p><p> The Rat, too, was not such a bad sort—</p><p>sneaky, of course, and would bear watching, </p><p>but he had played his part fairly well. He</p><p>would give him three hundred instead of </p><p>the promised two. After that he would gc </p><p>away. New York was no place for a gen- </p><p>tleman in Summer. He was scarcely aware </p><p>of his companion’s saying, “Now, my idea </p><p>of a model municipality”—or of his own </p><p>vague answer when the car came to a sud- </p><p>den stop. </p><p> He saw the Rat leap from his seat and</p><p>run to the shelter of a massive gray build- </p><p>ing, heard the millionaire’s protest and felt </p><p>those hands at which he had so often jeered, </p><p>seize him and drag him out.	i</p><p> Instantly his old-time alertness returned.</p><p>He thought for a minute of trying to bluff </p><p>it out, until he saw Denny talking with the j </p><p>sergeant. Then he knew he had been be- </p><p>trayed. He suffered peaceably the two </p><p>officers to take his arms and lead him inside </p><p>with only a backward glance at the avenue </p><p>deepening into purple twilight, the low- </p><p>bodied car panting eagerly to be off, the </p><p>millionaire gesticulating wildly, and Denny, </p><p>294 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>his twisted soul showing through his </p><p>crooked lips, going into the Chief's office </p><p>to receive his blood-money. </p><p> It takes a thief to catch a thief, and Larry</p><p>was caught red-handed. All his money, </p><p>won under so many fascinating nom-de- </p><p>plumes, could only help. His work, how- </p><p>ever, had been clever and they could con- </p><p>vict him on but one count. So for ten years </p><p>the light of heaven was denied to Larry </p><p>Lackmore. The great gate clanged for the </p><p>last time on a slim, elegant figure; the </p><p>prison barber shaved an aristocratic head </p><p>and Larry became Number 935. </p><p>IV </p><p>-as® THE ten years had come and gone </p><p>gffijf and Denny the Rat sat sipping beer </p><p>at his old table at Grogan’s. The </p><p>night bartender might have been, but </p><p>wasn’t, the same. At all events the table </p><p>seemed to be. It was in it’s old condition </p><p>of sloppiness; flies crawled stickily over thin </p><p>streams of beer; the windows were no less </p><p>dirty. Outside it was wet again; gust after </p><p>gust of wind and rain swept through the </p><p>narrow alley. </p><p> Time had dealt gently with the Rat. He</p><p>was a little more bald, a little more weasely, </p><p>a little more despicable. His thinness was </p><p>accentuated by a slightly protruding </p><p>paunch. In other respects he remained </p><p>unchanged. His calling was even the same. </p><p>The water-front was still his home, drunken</p><p>sailors still his prey, but the years were </p><p>neither so lean nor so hard, for with the five </p><p>hundred dollars he had purchased the </p><p>tobacco store and the woman. The one </p><p>flourished; the other lived merely because </p><p>of necessity. </p><p> There entered, with a whirlwind of rain</p><p>and sleet, a workingman very far gone in </p><p>the matter of liquor. The barkeeper eyed </p><p>Denny and Denny eyed the barkeeper; </p><p>then the latter’s hand strayed from his </p><p>bottle of knockout drops and substituted a </p><p>bottle of whisky. It seemed extravagance </p><p>to waste dope on one so nearly down. </p><p> The workingman, lurching heavily,</p><p>brought up against the bar, at the same </p><p>time awkwardly brushing back his hat. The </p><p>head thus displayed was close cropped. </p><p>Denny knew what that meant and prepared </p><p>to go to sleep. But the man paid for his </p><p>drink out of a handful of crumpled bills. </p><p>One of these, unnoticed, slid to the floor. </p><p>It was a twenty. The man then pushed </p><p>open the swinging doors and disappeared </p><p>into the night. </p><p> Instantly Denny was after him, pausing</p><p>only long enough to pick up the bill and </p><p>throw it to the bartender. He would claim </p><p>his share of it later, for the present duty </p><p>was urging him on. </p><p> The swaying figure was far down the</p><p>street before its pursuer caught up with it, </p><p>and then he had to fall back. Destiny </p><p>directed the wavering footsteps through </p><p>lighted streets ill fitted for the black-jack </p><p>nursed carefully in the Rat’s pocket. But </p><p>he had learned patience with age; not for a </p><p>second did he allow his quarry to be lost </p><p>to view. There were few people about, and </p><p>these, between the rain and minding their </p><p>own business, gave scant attention to the </p><p>two. The chase led up one street and down </p><p>another, but finally the man veered toward </p><p>the harbor. Denny, seeing his time ap- </p><p>proaching, crept closer. </p><p> Denny picked out the spot on the man’s</p><p>head where the blow was to fall. In pre- </p><p>vious years he would have gaged its </p><p>force, taking into consideration his victim’s </p><p>lack of hair, but while the years had </p><p>brought him caution concerning his own </p><p>skin it had likewise brought with it that </p><p>callousness of spirit always found in those </p><p>who prey upon their fellows. Between a </p><p>dead man and an unconscious one there is </p><p>but a slight step. </p><p> So Denny drew closer, intent on nothing</p><p>but the blow. In the shadow of a dingy</p><p>warehouse the man suddenly stopped, </p><p>wheeled and closed with his pursuer. There </p><p>was a slight scuffle, a slighter squeal of fear </p><p>and rage, and the Rat found himself picked </p><p>up in strong arms. With a heavy hand on </p><p>his windpipe he had no choice but to obey </p><p>the hoarse command for silence. </p><p> A few yards away a catboat, tied fast to</p><p>the wharf, lay tossing in the water. Thither </p><p>with steady steps, quite at variance with </p><p>his former erratic movements, the drunken </p><p>man carried his burden. Once aboard he </p><p>deposited him in the cabin and without ex- </p><p>planation sought the deck. Denny could </p><p>hear the ropes being cast off, the creak of </p><p>blocks, and felt the gentle swaying of the </p><p>boat. </p><p> Soon the movement grew stronger and</p><p>he knew they were beating out of the har- </p><p>bor. The night was a hard one; its force </p><p>in the alley was magnified a hundredfold </p><p>Denny the Rat </p><p>295 </p><p>on the water. By peering out of a small </p><p>window he could see the lights of the city </p><p>gradually fade from view. Several times </p><p>they passed ships anchored in the roadway </p><p>and he strained his lungs to make them hear </p><p>his cry for help, but none answered. The </p><p>wind roughly threw the words back in his </p><p>face, as contemptuously as he had listened </p><p>to his victims’ cries. There was something </p><p>malicious about the way it forced his breath </p><p>back on him, something malicious and yet </p><p>disdainful, as though he were of no more </p><p>account than a withered Autumn leaf. </p><p> Later, by the dangerous rocking of the</p><p>little craft, he knew they were out on the </p><p>ocean. Swift-driven foam cut his cheeks; </p><p>spume and the fear of death forced him </p><p>back to a corner where he squatted close </p><p>to the floor. His twisted lips drew back </p><p>over his yellow teeth for all the world like a </p><p>rat in a trap. Why any one should want to </p><p>kidnap him he did not know, but, remem- </p><p>bering the wrongs he had done in the past, </p><p>Denny was afraid. </p><p>SAT TWELVE o’clock die catboat </p><p>came to anchor. His captor de- </p><p>scended and, having first taken his </p><p>weapons, bound his eyes and led him on </p><p>deck. Then he felt himself being lifted </p><p>over the side. The water crept from his </p><p>knees to his waist, from his waist to his </p><p>shoulders. It was cold and he cried out </p><p>again and again. With the water lapping </p><p>Ms neck, the inexorable pressure down- </p><p>ward was withdrawn. He found himself</p><p>resting easily in the water, supported by </p><p>his hands on the gunnel. The bandage was </p><p>whipped from his eyes and Denny the Rat </p><p>found himself confronted with a face he had </p><p>condemned to a ten years’ death! </p><p> He did not cry out again; his tongue was</p><p>glued to the roof of his mouth, his brain lay </p><p>dormant. In the minute they looked into </p><p>each other’s eyes he could think of nothing </p><p>but the change wrought in the countenance </p><p>above him. The sharp features, clean-cut </p><p>as a thoroughbred’s, had broadened and </p><p>coarsened. In place of the cool tolerance </p><p>through which Larry had viewed the world </p><p>there was a bigoted passion for one idea. </p><p>The lips were as thin as before, but the </p><p>years of imprisonment had straightened their </p><p>bow. If anything, they curved downward </p><p>with a cruel sweep. Wrinkles of laughter </p><p>had been replaced by creases of suffering, </p><p>the unnecessary suffering that sours the </p><p>heart. Between them, Denny and the </p><p>prison had achieved a miracle—they had </p><p>turned a man into a beast. </p><p> “Denny,” said Larry at length, and the</p><p>Rat trembled more at the sound of that </p><p>half-forgotten voice than he had at the </p><p>touch of the cold water, “here is where </p><p>you and I square accounts. If I punished </p><p>you as you deserved, you’d die by slow tor- </p><p>ture. Drowning is an easy death, they </p><p>say.” He clutched the thin shoulders and, </p><p>twisting him fiercely around, pointed to </p><p>some lights in the distance. </p><p> “That is shore,” said Larry. “It is</p><p>three miles away and you can’t make it in </p><p>this sea. You swim on and on and on. At </p><p>first it won’t be so hard, but later with </p><p>every stroke you will sink lower in the </p><p>water. Your arms will weaken first, then </p><p>your legs. You will turn on your back and </p><p>float, but always you will grow weaker. </p><p>Every second of the time you will think. </p><p>You’ll remember each time you have seen </p><p>me from the first to the last. You will </p><p>recall I always treated you square. The </p><p>faces of the men you have knocked on the </p><p>head will haunt you and then, my dear </p><p>friend Denny, water will creep up and into </p><p>your mouth! You will sputter and strug- </p><p>gle, maybe even scream a little. Your chest </p><p>will spUt with agony and then, dear, dear </p><p>Denny; you will go down, down to hell where </p><p>you belong!” </p><p> He thrust the Rat’s hands off and, lying</p><p>flat downward on the deck, watched the </p><p>swimmer being swallowed up in the dark- </p><p>ness. While he was still a vague blot on</p><p>the water, Larry made a trumpet with his </p><p>hands and called after him, “And remem- </p><p>ber, Denny, the Baltic sails to-night!” </p><p> As for Denny he swam easily and</p><p>chuckled to himself at the thought of whal </p><p>a great fool Larry w'as. Three miles to </p><p>shore! Hadn’t he seen the lights them- </p><p>selves? Three miles in a rough sea was </p><p>nothing to one bom on the docks. Prison </p><p>had crazed Larry; there was no other ex- </p><p>planation. When he landed he would buy </p><p>dry clothes, have Billy McShane, now a </p><p>sergeant, arrest his enemy and he, the </p><p>Rat, would live long and prosper. </p><p> HE SWAM for an hour, pleased</p><p>mwith these thoughts, then, rearing </p><p> high in the water, looked toward the</p><p>lights. In spite of the distance he had come </p><p>they looked no nearer. The night must be </p><p>Adventure </p><p>getting misty or he must have wacer in </p><p>his eyes. He rubbed them carefully and, </p><p>after a short spell on his back, treaded </p><p>water. Surely the lights were farther off </p><p>now than before 1 His craven heart flut- </p><p>tered fiercely and in a panic he raced along. </p><p>Winded, he finally brought up and set him- </p><p>self steadily and powerfully to overtake the </p><p>lights. </p><p> His muscles still worked rhythmically;</p><p>the years had done little to impair his </p><p>powers. His mind reverted to Larry. What </p><p>was it the fool had said about dead men </p><p>mocking him? Men he hit never came </p><p>back! With his black-jack he could crush </p><p>their skulls like an eggshell! “Dead men </p><p>tell, no tales” was his motto, and if they </p><p>told no tales, surely they could not come </p><p>back. But what else had Larry said? Oh, </p><p>yes! That he would think over every time </p><p>they had been together from first to last. </p><p>This was easy, he could number them on </p><p>the fingers of one hand. </p><p> The first time had been at Grogan’s and</p><p>the second at Atlantic City, when they had </p><p>attached those priceless antiques. Every </p><p>morning they had taken a dip in the ocean, </p><p>swimming far out to sea. One of the life- </p><p>guards had told them they usually covered </p><p>six miles, and here was Larry trying to </p><p>drown him in half that distance! Then </p><p>for some reason his thoughts shifted to the </p><p>last time he had seen Larry, lying face </p><p>downward on the deck and megaphoning </p><p>his last words to him through his hands. </p><p>At the remembrance of that, the Rat threw </p><p>up his hands and screamed hoarsely. No </p><p>wonder the lights were fading!</p><p> He had set himself to overtake an ocean liner I</p><p> But such is the love we bear for life that</p><p>Denny the Rat, totally without hope, </p><p>swam on and on. </p><p>BREKVTaai SALT </p><p>BY EDWARD CROSSLAND SMITH </p><p>VINCENT came into the dining- </p><p>room with such a calamitous ex- </p><p>pression on his full-moon face that </p><p>one accustomed, as I was, to his </p><p>habitual radiance could not ignore it. He </p><p>sank into the chair opposite, and gave an </p><p>order for soft boiled eggs and coffee. </p><p> “Is there a competent dentist in this</p><p>place?” he inquired dejectedly. </p><p> I named one of good repute in the calling.</p><p>“Toothache, I suppose?” </p><p> “Loose filling. I suppose I’ll have to live</p><p>on liquid diet now, until it’s fixed. You </p><p>see,” he complained, as his ascetic breakfast </p><p>was put before him, “I’ve been eating dry </p><p>toast to keep down fat, and I’ll have to cut </p><p>that out until this tooth is fixed. You can’t </p><p>eat dry toast with a loose filling rattling </p><p>around in your tooth like a roulette-bal) </p><p>when the wheel slows down.” </p><p> I conceded the point, and reverted to the</p><p>business in hand. “ When we get out there </p><p>Bread and Salt </p><p>297 </p><p>to-day,” I counselled, “don’t just take </p><p>Black’s word for everything. Make some </p><p>soundings for yourself.’’ </p><p> Instantly his native optimism came to the</p><p>front, and the clouds began to disappear. </p><p>“You’re soured, George,” he returned </p><p>lightly. “They haven’t all had your luck. </p><p>Besides, how on earth can they salt a placer </p><p>mine? It’s preposterous! ” </p><p> “I don’t know,” I replied doggedly. “I</p><p>don’t know whether they can or whether </p><p>they can’t. All that I am laboring to get </p><p>into your head is that you can’t believe all </p><p>Black says. Mind, I don’t say that Black </p><p>ever did salt a mine. But I do know that he </p><p>sold a couple of bonanzas to Easterners like </p><p>you and by some mysterious law of Nature </p><p>they ceased to produce just about as soon as </p><p>the purchase price was paid over.” </p><p> Vincent nodded indulgently. “Quartz.</p><p>Any fool can salt a quartz mine—shoot it in </p><p>with a shotgun, mix it in the dump, squirt </p><p>chloride of gold into the sample sack with </p><p>a syringe—forty ways. That’s easy. But </p><p>now you talk to me about salting a placer— </p><p>where you just shovel up the dirt and pan it </p><p>out—acres and acres of it. I say it’s out of </p><p>the question.”</p><p> Vincent had made his money in the East</p><p>in commerce, and a man that can do that </p><p>without help, as he had, is ordinarily able to </p><p>take care of himself. O11 the other hand, </p><p>this was Montana and gold mines, and, be </p><p>a-scsan’s business ability what it may, any </p><p>Easterner is a tenderfoot when it comes to </p><p>mining. It was no fault of mine that he </p><p>had fallen under Black’s spell, though I did </p><p>introduce Vincent in the club where Black </p><p>got to him. But the man who has suffered </p><p>himself from the mining fever—and I had— </p><p>feels an obligation to protect the unwary </p><p>from exposure. Moreover, as Vincent had </p><p>done me a good turn once, I conceived it my </p><p>duty to throw cold water. </p><p> “ Placer mining is not what it used to be,”</p><p>I stated disparagingly. </p><p> But my shot went wild. He began to</p><p>spout statistics like an eruption of Old </p><p>Faithful. “Of course not!” he assented </p><p>with animation. “Neither are methods </p><p>what they were. The old-timer with his </p><p>pan and sluice-box let enough gold escape </p><p>him to pay the national debt. Look at tie </p><p>fortunes that have been made by cyaniding </p><p>the old dumps! Look at the low-grade ore </p><p>they work these days! Look at the old </p><p>placers worked over for the third time at </p><p>d </p><p>a profit! Why, do you know how much you </p><p>need to make placer ground pay now under </p><p>improved methods? Ten cents a yard, in </p><p>the right places! Twenty-five cents is big. </p><p>Give me a piece of ground that rims twenty- </p><p>five cents to the yard and I’ll make a fortune. </p><p>Your old-time prospector wouldn’t fool with </p><p>ground that didn’t run five cents a shovel. </p><p>Generally they wanted about ten dollars </p><p>to the pan.” </p><p> “Oh, if you’ve got the ground-” I</p><p>began. </p><p> He made a sweep with his egg-spoon that</p><p>left golden traces on the white tablecloth. </p><p>“Ground! That’s the point. Black says </p><p>there’s oodles of it. He says it rims forty </p><p>cents to the yard as far as he has tried it. </p><p>That’s all I want.” </p><p> “Yes, that’s what Black says,” I returned</p><p>grudgingly, unwilling to yield. “I’ve had </p><p>a little experience with mines myself, and </p><p>I’ve seen a few of them sold that-” </p><p> Again he stopped me. “Quartz,” he re-</p><p>peated serenely and exasperatingly. “And </p><p>furthermore, George,” he continued with </p><p>dignity, rising from the table, “I am perhaps </p><p>not a complete ass, despite the fact that </p><p>I wasn’t born west of the Mississippi!”</p><p>(||g|| THROUGH the windows a big tour- </p><p>j|!!|l ing-car could be seen lazily rolling up </p><p>to the curb at the hotel entrance. </p><p>"There they are,” remarked Vincent with </p><p>a sigh of relief. “ Get your coat and we’ll </p><p>be going.” </p><p> I maneuvered Black into the front seat</p><p>with the driver. I hadn’t yet resigned my </p><p>trust as guardian angel, even if the job was </p><p>a thankless one, and I didn’t propose to </p><p>leave Vincent with Black where I couldn’t </p><p>hear all that was said. So Black was forced </p><p>to lean over his seat and expound his theo- </p><p>ries in the face of my openly exhibited skep- </p><p>ticism. He treated Vincent to a highly </p><p>scientific disquisition on placers, full of such </p><p>phrases as “mother lode in the neighbor- </p><p>hood,” “old river channel,” “pay streaks,” </p><p>“volcanic upheavals,” and something about </p><p>“only a foot and a half to bed-rock,” while </p><p>I assumed a look of exquisite boredom, as </p><p>one to whom it was all ancient and stale. </p><p> The day was such as is seen only in the</p><p>high altitudes of the Rockies—a clear June </p><p>morning filled with the tang of pure air, dry </p><p>and cool. The car sped faultlessly over the </p><p>hard, smooth road. On such a day even my </p><p>settled habit of suspicion slowly yielded to </p><p>298 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>my sensuous appreciation of the weather </p><p>and the environment. “ Gold is where you </p><p>find it,” sayeth the proverb. The fact that </p><p>I had failed was no evidence that Black </p><p>hadn’t found it. Plenty of others had. </p><p> About nobn we reached the river and the</p><p>placer ground. A little stream of crystal </p><p>water raced madly down between two </p><p>mountains and debouoted upon a flat too </p><p>suddenly to select its own course, and was </p><p>broken and spread out into a wide estuary </p><p>of numberless tiny rivulets between flat, </p><p>black sand-bars with surfaces almost flush </p><p>with the water and level as bilhard-tables. </p><p>At the junction with the river these bars </p><p>were gradually submerged, but for a consid- </p><p>erable distance downstream the left bank </p><p>was filled in with the same character of </p><p>deposit. </p><p> Black got out first and removed a pan and</p><p>shovel from the bottom of the car. “This </p><p>is the place,” he said, waving his arm </p><p>toward the sand-bars. “Fred, you run the </p><p>car over to Miller’s and see if you can get </p><p>some gasoline from him. I’m afraid we’re </p><p>short. Come back here for us.” </p><p> We climbed out and Vincent surveyed the</p><p>expanse with delight in his eyes, calculating</p><p>its extent. </p><p> “All the land you can use,” said Black,</p><p>replying to Vincent’s look. “And a river- </p><p>ful of water to work it—and no expense for </p><p>pumping.” </p><p> “Has it all been tested—prospected?”</p><p>asked Vincent, nodding toward a couple of </p><p>shallow holes in the bar opposite. </p><p> Black shook his head. “By no means.</p><p>Haven’t had the time for it. But you can </p><p>see for yourself the formation is the same </p><p>all over the flat. What holds good for one </p><p>part of it must hold good for it all. Come, </p><p>and I’ll show you.” </p><p> He stepped across the little stream at his</p><p>feet and advanced to the middle of the bar. </p><p>We followed him. The driver had already </p><p>turned his car about and disappeared behind </p><p>the shoulder of a hill. Black confidently </p><p>thrust his shovel into the sand and dumped </p><p>the contents into the wash-pan. This he </p><p>carried to the water’s edge and half filled </p><p>with water, which he proceeded to slush this </p><p>way and that, spilling it out now and then </p><p>with the mud and gravel, and continuing the </p><p>motion until all of the water and most of the </p><p>dirt had been poured away. </p><p> “See here!” he said at last, holding up</p><p>the pan. </p><p> He pointed to some tiny, yellowish parti-</p><p>cles at the lower edge of the black dirt re- </p><p>maining in the pan. It was perhaps as mucb </p><p>as five cents in gold. </p><p> “But,” he added, “that isn’t saying that’s</p><p>all there was in the pan. Washing with </p><p>a pan is the most primitive of methods </p><p>Now let’s see what we get here.” </p><p> He made several trials, six in all, I believe.</p><p>Five out of the six showed colors. Not one </p><p>of the washings produced as much as </p><p>twenty-five cents in gold—and that wasn’t </p><p>expected—but on the whole the showing </p><p>was good and Vincent was plainly impressed. </p><p>I saw that it was no longer a question of his </p><p>buying, but simply one of price. We re- </p><p>turned to dry ground, found a comfortable </p><p>seat under a scrub pine, and they began to </p><p>discuss terms. </p><p>“IF YOU all are going to sit here </p><p>and dicker,” I said, “I am going </p><p>to take a walk about and stretch </p><p>my legs.” </p><p> I had a little plan of my own and I wanted</p><p>to see that chauffeur. It was a good mile to </p><p>the farmhouse whither he had gone, and </p><p>after I had seen him and transacted my </p><p>business I returned to the scene of the bar </p><p>gaining.</p><p> “Fred says there’s something out of</p><p>whack with that machine,” I announced as </p><p>I came up to them. </p><p> Black’s eyebrows contracted with annoy-</p><p>ance. “Let him fix it, then!” he answered </p><p>irritably. </p><p> “He says he can’t do it,” I informed him.</p><p> “ Why, what in thunder is the matter? ”</p><p>he demanded. </p><p> “That’s more than I know,” said I, sitting</p><p>down. “I’m not a mechanic.” </p><p> He got up in great disgust and began to</p><p>dust lus trousers. “Well, I’ll be everlast- </p><p>ingly and eternally—I wonder what that kid </p><p>thinks he’s fit for, anyway! The car was all </p><p>right this morning. We’ll have to go over </p><p>there and see what’s the trouble, I suppose.” </p><p> I deliberately took my pipe from my</p><p>pocket and filled it. “I am supposing I’m </p><p>not going to walk that mile again!” I said </p><p>with finality. “I’ve got a prickly-pear </p><p>needle sticking a full inch into my foot, arid </p><p>I’ve decided to wait here. You can come </p><p>back this way for me. I’ll be here.” </p><p> He favored me with a side-long scowl, and</p><p>I could see he didn’t like it. “Would you </p><p>like to walk over, Vincent?” he suggested. </p><p>Bread and Salt </p><p>299 </p><p> Under cover of my hands raised to light</p><p>my pipe, I gave Vincent a wink and he de- </p><p>clined the suggestion, and after a little fur- </p><p>ther fretting Black was compelled to set o£F </p><p>by himself. </p><p> I gave him plenty of time to get out of</p><p>sight and hearing. Then I took up the pan </p><p>and shovel myself. </p><p> “We’ll do a little prospecting on our own</p><p>hook!” I laughed. “I thought I’d manage </p><p>to get rid of him somehow.” </p><p> I chose a spot some distance from where</p><p>Black had taken his dirt. We filled the pan </p><p>and washed it out. We got nothing. </p><p> “However, that really doesn’t prove any-</p><p>thing,” said Vincent hopefully. </p><p> “Not a thing,” I admitted, and dug up</p><p>another panful. This time we got two little </p><p>colors, almost microscopic and of no calcula- </p><p>ble value. I shifted ground and washed </p><p>again. No showing. </p><p> “Do you know what I begin to believe,</p><p>Vincent? ” I said, </p><p> “Yes. But you might be off the pay-</p><p>streak, you know.” </p><p> Like Hamlet and his friends we once more</p><p>removed our ground. “I thought I knew </p><p>our friend Black pretty well!” I chuckled. </p><p>Again I'heaved the black sand into the pan</p><p>and dipped up water and swished it about </p><p>and spilled it over the rim, while Vincent </p><p>leaned over my shoulder and watched in- </p><p>tently. </p><p> “-Let me have it.” he urged finally. “You</p><p>go at it too carelessly.” </p><p> I resigned the pan to him, and stood aside</p><p>while he scooped up more water and care- </p><p>fully slopped it over the brim, a spoonful at </p><p>a time. I thought he would never have </p><p>done. Tired at length with standing still, </p><p>I took a turn up and down the bars. I tried </p><p>to find evidence on the surface of the ground, </p><p>but the bars all lay so low that the least rise </p><p>in the creek would overflow them, and search </p><p>was useless. Passing by Vincent on my still </p><p>hunt I heard him suddenly catch his breath, </p><p>and stopped to see what was the matter. </p><p> “Suffering Sassafras!” he ejaculated awe-</p><p>somely. “Come, look here, George!” </p><p> I looked, and just peeping up out of the</p><p>handful of mud left in the pan I beheld the </p><p>smooth, yellow top of a gold nugget as big </p><p>as a pea! With tremulous fingers Vincent </p><p>picked it out and contemplated it with rap- </p><p>ture. Finally he handed it over to me. </p><p>It was a good nugget, pure gold, and worth </p><p>two dollars at the least! </p><p> “I take it all back, Vincent,” I said.</p><p>“That’s ‘the real thing, Annie.’ Nobody </p><p>salted that here! I reckon this is a placer </p><p>claim all right.” </p><p> “Let’s hurry up and see if we can find any</p><p>more before Black gets back!” proposed </p><p>Vincent, grabbing thepan. “ Why, this may </p><p>be another Alder Gulch!” </p><p>peg JUST then the chugging of the </p><p>machine came to our ears. For a </p><p>■2** momentVincent hesitated, then gave </p><p>it up. “We haven’t time,” he murmured </p><p>disappointedly, bending down to wash the </p><p>pan clean. Then we went back to the dry </p><p>ground again, regaining our place just as the </p><p>car rounded the hill. I still held the pre- </p><p>cious nugget in my hand. </p><p> “Put that thing in your pocket!” Vin-</p><p>cent commanded excitedly. “For heaven’s </p><p>sake don’t let Black see it! He’d triple the </p><p>price of this land. And keep quiet about it, </p><p>too!” </p><p> Black himself was driving the auto, the</p><p>driver having been relegated to the back </p><p>seat in disgrace. I knew why. </p><p> “Nothing in the world the matter but</p><p>a spark-plug blown out!” Black explained </p><p>wrathfully as he brought the car to a </p><p>stop. “Any fool ought to know how to </p><p>Sx that!”</p><p> Vincent and Black sat together on the</p><p>way back and sparred for points all the way </p><p>in. The agreement was eventually reached </p><p>just a short way from town by a concession </p><p>on Black’s part, which I am certain he was </p><p>ready to yield all the time rather than not </p><p>make the sale. </p><p> At the hotel we parted, Black going to</p><p>find his attorney to prepare the necessary </p><p>documents. Vincent was elated. The day </p><p>in the open had given us both splendid ap- </p><p>petites and we had a sumptuous dinner. </p><p>Vincent threw all his dietary injunctions to </p><p>the four winds and ate like a wolf. When </p><p>we finally got down to the cheese and water- </p><p>crackers he sighed like a young simoon and </p><p>announced that he would have to fast for </p><p>a month to get back into shape. </p><p> “But I did a good piere of work to-day,</p><p>George.” he remarked, by way of justifica- </p><p>tion, at the same time adding a piece of </p><p>cheese and bite of bread to the burden. His </p><p>mouth closed upon the morsel apprecia- </p><p>tively while a wave of gastronomic delight </p><p>spread itself from chin to eyebrows. My </p><p>amused study of his perfect satisfaction, </p><p>300 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>however, was rudely disturbed when he </p><p>suddenly leaped to his feet and dapped his </p><p>hand to his cheek, his whole countenance </p><p>twisted in a spasm of pain. </p><p> “Crucified Cuspidores!” he yelled in a</p><p>voice that filled the room. </p><p> “Why, what on earth?” I inquired in</p><p>surprise. </p><p> Without answering lie made a sudden</p><p>dart for the door. Half-way there he </p><p>wheeled and as suddenly rushed back to me. </p><p>“What’s Black’s ’phone number?” b.e cried </p><p>wildly. </p><p> “I don’t know. Ask the clerk. What’s</p><p>the matter?” </p><p> He took his hand from his mouth. “Mat-</p><p>ter enough! That magnificent, transcend- </p><p>ant, potential, glimmering gold-mine of ours </p><p>is nothing more than a vainglorious, inflated </p><p>burlesque and fraud I That’s what’s the </p><p>matter!” </p><p> L was bewildered. “What makes you</p><p>think that?” </p><p> With an effort he regained his composure</p><p>and resumed his seat. “ Anyway, I can call </p><p>the deal off when he comes here to-night,” </p><p>he said. “The reason why I think it,” he </p><p>added sullenly, “is because that nugget we </p><p>thought so much of is nothing more nor less </p><p>than the filling out of my tooth!”</p><p> “The filling of your tooth!” I echoed in-</p><p>credulously. </p><p> “Just that! And we thought it was</p><p>a gold-mine! That filling was loose this </p><p>morning. Must have slipped out of the </p><p>cavity while I was staring like a petrified </p><p>catfish with its mouth open at you washing </p><p>out that mud to-day!” </p><p> I drew the supposed nugget from my</p><p>pocket and inspected it. He was correct. </p><p>The precious lump upon which we had pred- </p><p>icated a gold mine was merely a dentist’s </p><p>filling. Under an enlightened scrutiny its </p><p>shape betrayed the previous character of its </p><p>servitude. </p><p> “I’ll call the deal off,” repeated Vincent</p><p>determinedly. “What do I want with his </p><p>desert of black sand? I’ll show your friend </p><p>how he’ll salt mud-geysers and buffalo- </p><p>wallows and what-not and shove ’em off on </p><p>me for gold-mines!” </p><p> A bell-boy appeared at the entrance to</p><p>the dining-room, glanced about the tables </p><p>and loudly called, “Vincent!” </p><p> Vincent hastily drew back from the table.</p><p>“That’s Black, now!” he exclaimed. “I’ll </p><p>favor that gentleman with a statement of </p><p>my opinion of the ethics of this little game </p><p>of his!” </p><p> I finished my coffee, and in a few moments</p><p>followed him. I located him and Black </p><p>in the deserted writing-room, Vincent very </p><p>warm and scowling, Black quite composed </p><p>and smiling. The promoter of bonanzas </p><p>fingered a little slip of paper as he spoke: </p><p>“You seemed rather anxious to secure the </p><p>property on the way in to-day,” he was say- </p><p>ing, with a mocking note in his voice. </p><p>“Here is a little memorandum of the temis </p><p>of sale that we made out for the lawyers’ </p><p>guidance.” </p><p> “But the whole thing is a blame fraud!”</p><p>retorted Vincent hotly. “I was buying </p><p>that for a gold-mine. And it turns-ouf that </p><p>what I took to be placer gold .was -just a </p><p>tooth-filling! What do you suppos'6 X jvaht </p><p>with that sand-bar unless it’s whatl took.it </p><p>to be?” </p><p> Black rose with the air of a man weary of</p><p>discussion. “I am sure I can’t say, Mr. </p><p>Vincent,” he returned cooil}'. “I only </p><p>know that I have here your signed-ligree- </p><p>ment to buy the property at the price stated. </p><p>In our State that is sufficient to enforce the </p><p>carrying out of the contract—which I shall </p><p>certainly do, by suit at law, if necessary. </p><p>And here,” he concluded, placing a neatly </p><p>folded document on the settee, “is your</p><p>deed, properly executed. I wish you good- </p><p>evening and good luck!” And he passed out </p><p>of the hotel. </p><p> I turned to Vincent, who had picked up</p><p>the deed. He shrugged his shoulders. </p><p>“My own fault,” he murmured. “I </p><p>suspected he was tricky, and I wanted </p><p>something to hold him, so I suggested </p><p>that infernal memorandum. Confound </p><p>that tooth!” </p><p>HOWEVER, as has been remarked </p><p>by others, Dame Fortune is a fickle </p><p>lady who sometimes, jests as she </p><p>turns the wheel. Winners are not winners </p><p>till the game is all played, and lottery </p><p>prizes go by chance, not favor. </p><p> “I notice,” I remarked, laying aside the</p><p>newspaper as Black came into the club </p><p>a few days since, “that Vincent has. just </p><p>made another big clean-up at that'placer </p><p>mine you sold him last Summer.’’ </p><p> He favored me with-such ^ scowl.as lit</p><p>might have given me had I Stepped on his </p><p>favorite corn. “Oh, ——!•” Be growled, </p><p>and went on into the bjir.. </p><p> JOHN BUCHAN</p><p>CHAPTER XXVIII </p><p>m LAST-SIGHT OF THE REVEREND JOHN </p><p>LAPUTA </p><p>I W“TT WAS dark before I got into the </p><p>| gorge of the Letaba. I passed </p><p>! man.}' patrols, but few people </p><p>spoke to me and none tried to </p><p>stop me. Some may have known me, but </p><p>I think it was my face and figure that tied </p><p>their tongues. I must have been pale as </p><p>death, with tangled hair, and fever burning </p><p>in my eyes. Also on the left temple was the </p><p>splash of blood. </p><p> At Main Drift T found a big body of po-</p><p>lice holding the fort. I splashed through </p><p>and stumbled into one of their camp-fires. </p><p>A maij questioned me and told me that </p><p>■	Arcoll had got his quarry. “He's dead,</p><p>they say. They shot him out on the hills </p><p>when he was making for the Limpopo.” </p><p>B'iit I kitew that this was not true. It was </p><p>burned on my mind that Laputa was </p><p>.liivt. nay;‘ was waiting for me. and that </p><p>it was God’s will that we should meet at </p><p>the Cave. </p><p> A little later I struck the track of the</p><p>Kaffir’s march. There was a broad, tram- </p><p>pled way through the bush, and I followed </p><p>it, for it led to Dupree’s Drift. All this </p><p>time I was urging the schimmel with all the </p><p>vigor I had left in me. I had quite lost any </p><p>remnant of fear. There were no terrors left</p><p>for me. At Dupree’s Drift I rode the ford </p><p>without a thought of crocodiles. I looked </p><p>placidly at the spot where Henriques had </p><p>slain the Keeper and I had stolen the rubies. </p><p>There was no interest or imagination linger- </p><p>ing in my dull brain. My nerves had sud- </p><p>denly become things of stolid iron. </p><p> At Umvelos’ I had not the leisure to do</p><p>more than glance at the shell which I had </p><p>built. I think I had forgotten all about </p><p>that night when I lay in the cellar and heard </p><p>Laputa’s plans. Indeed, my doings of the </p><p>past days were all hazy and trivial in my </p><p>mind. I sawr only one sight clearly—two </p><p>men, one tall and black, the other little and </p><p>sallow, slowly creeping nearer to the Rooi- </p><p>‘ Copyright, x9»o by Jc&gt;.» Buchan </p><p>302 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>rand, and myself, a midget on a horse, spur- </p><p>ring far behind through the bush on their </p><p>traO. </p><p> I had no exhilaration in my quest. I do</p><p>not think I had even much hope, for some- </p><p>thing had gone numb and cold in me and </p><p>killed my youth. I told myself that treas- </p><p>ure-hunting was an enterprise accursed by </p><p>God, and that I should most likely die. </p><p>That Laputa and Henriques would die I was </p><p>fully certain. The three of us would leave </p><p>our bones to bleach among the diamonds, </p><p>andin a little while the Prester’s Collar would </p><p>glow amid a little heap of human dust. </p><p>I was quite convinced of all this, and quite </p><p>apathetic. It really did not matter so long </p><p>as I came up with Laputa and Henriques, </p><p>and settled scores with them. That mat- </p><p>tered everything in the world, for it was </p><p>my destiny. </p><p> I had no means of knowing how long I</p><p>took, but it was after midnight before I </p><p>passed Umvelos’, and ere I got to the </p><p>Rooriand there was a fluttering of dawn in </p><p>the east. I must have passed east of Ar- </p><p>colFs men, who were driving the bush </p><p>towards Majinje’s. I had ridden the night </p><p>down and id not feel so very tired. My </p><p>horse was stumbling, but my own limbs </p><p>scarcely pained me. To be sure, I was still </p><p>and nerveless as if hewn out of wood, but </p><p>I had been as bad when I left Bruderstoon. </p><p>I felt as if I could go on riding to the end of </p><p>the world. </p><p> At the brink of the bush I dismounted and</p><p>turned the schimmel loose. I had brought </p><p>no halter and I wanted him to graze and </p><p>roll. The light was sufficient to let me see </p><p>the great rock-face rising in a tower of dim</p><p>purple. The sky was still picked out with </p><p>stars, but the moon had long gone down and </p><p>the east was flushing. I marched up the </p><p>path to the Cave, very different from the </p><p>timid being who had walked the same road </p><p>three Dights before. Then my terrors were </p><p>all to come; now I had conquered the terror </p><p>and seen the other side of fear. I was cen- </p><p>turies older. </p><p>BUT beside the path lay something </p><p>which made me pause. It was a </p><p>dead body, and the head was turned </p><p>away from me. I did not need to see the </p><p>face to know who it was. There had been </p><p>only two men in my vision and one of them </p><p>was immortal. </p><p> I stopped and turned the body over.</p><p>There was no joy in my heart, none of the </p><p>lust of satisfied vengeance or slaked hate. </p><p>I had forgotten about the killing of my dog </p><p>and all the rest of Henriques’ doings. It </p><p>was only with curiosity that I looked down </p><p>oh the dead face, swollen and livid in the </p><p>first light of morning. </p><p> The man had been strangled. His neck,</p><p>as we say in Scotland, was “ thrawn,” and </p><p>that was why he had lain on his back, yet </p><p>with his face turned away from me. I </p><p>looked closer and saw that there was blood </p><p>on his shirt and hands, but no wound. It </p><p>was not his blood, but some other’s. He </p><p>had been dead probably since before mid- </p><p>night. Then, a few feet off on the path, </p><p>I found a pistol with two chambers empty, </p><p> What had happened was very plain.</p><p>Henriques had tried to shoot Laputa at the </p><p>entrance of the Cave for the sake of the </p><p>Collar and the treasure within. He had </p><p>wounded him—gravely, I thought, to judge </p><p>from the amount of blood—but the quick- </p><p>ness and marksmanship of the Portuguese </p><p>had not availed to save his life from those </p><p>terrible hands. After two shots Laputa had </p><p>got hold of him .and choked his life out as </p><p>easily as a man twists a partridge’s neck! </p><p>Then he had gone in to the Cave. </p><p> I saw the marks of blood on the road and</p><p>hastened on. Laputa had been hours in the </p><p>Cave, enough to work havoc with the treas- </p><p>ure. He was wounded, too, and desperate. </p><p>Probably he had come to the Rooirand, </p><p>looking for sanctuary and rest for a day or </p><p>two, but, if Henriques had shot straight, he </p><p>might find a safer sanctuary and a longer </p><p>rest. For the third time in my life I pushed </p><p>up the gully between the straight high walls </p><p>of rock and heard from the heart of the hills </p><p>the thunder of the imprisoned river.</p><p> The hidden turnstile in the right wall</p><p>stood ajar. I entered and carelessly swung </p><p>it behind me. The gates clashed into place </p><p>with a finality that told me they were firmly </p><p>shut. I did not know the secret of them, so </p><p>how should I get out again? </p><p> These things troubled me less than the</p><p>fact that I had no light at all now. I had </p><p>to go on my knees to ascend the stair, and </p><p>I could feel that the steps were wet. It </p><p>must be Laputa’s blood. </p><p> Next I was out on the gallery that skirted</p><p>the chasm. The sky above me was growing </p><p>pale with dawn, and, far below, the tossing </p><p>waters were fretted with light. A light, </p><p>fragrant wind was blowing on the hills, and </p><p>Fresver John </p><p>303 </p><p>a breath of it came down the funnel. I saw </p><p>that my hands were all bloody with the </p><p>stains on the steps, and I rubbed them on </p><p>the rock to clean them. Without a tremor </p><p>I crossed the stone slab over the gorge and </p><p>plunged into the dark alley that led to the </p><p>inner chamber. </p><p> As before, there was a light in front of me,</p><p>but this time it was a pin-point and not the </p><p>glare of many torches. I felt my way care- </p><p>fully by the walls of the passage, though I </p><p>did not really fear anything. It was only </p><p>by the stopping of these lateral walls that </p><p>I knew I was in the Cave, for the place had </p><p>only one single speck of light. The falling </p><p>wall of water stood out gray-green and </p><p>ghostly on the left, and I noticed that higher </p><p>up it was lit' as if from the open air. I </p><p>walked- a few paces and then I made out </p><p>ihat, the spark in front was a lantern. </p><p> My eyes were getting used to the half-</p><p>tight, and I saw what was beside the lantern. </p><p>Laputa knelt on the ashes of the fire the </p><p>Keeper had kindled three days before. He </p><p>knelt before, and half leaned on, a rude </p><p>altar of stone. The lantern stood by him </p><p>on the floor and its faint circle showed some- </p><p>thing I was not unprepared for. Blood was </p><p>welling from his side and spreading in a dark </p><p>pool over the ashes. </p><p>I HAD no fear, only a great pity— </p><p>pity for the lost romance, for vain </p><p>endeavor, for fruitless courage. </p><p>■‘Greeting, Inkulu!” I said in Kaffir, as if </p><p>I had been one of his Indunas. </p><p> He turned his head and slowly and pain-</p><p>fully rose to his feet. The place, it was </p><p>clear, was lit from without and the daylight </p><p>was growing. The wall of the river had </p><p>become a sheet of jewels, passing from pel-</p><p>lucid diamond above to the translucent </p><p>emerald below. A dusky twilight sought </p><p>out the extreme corners of the Cave. La- </p><p>puta’s tall figure stood swaying above the </p><p>white ashes, liis hand pressed to his side. </p><p> “.Who is it?” he said, looking at me with</p><p>blind eyes. </p><p> “It is the storekeeper from Umvelos’,’1</p><p>I answered. </p><p> “The storekeeper of Umvelos’,” he re-</p><p>peated. “ God has used the weak things of </p><p>the world to confound the strong. A king </p><p>dies because a pedler is troublesome. </p><p>What do they call you, man? You deserve </p><p>to be remembered.” </p><p> I told him.. “David Crawfurd.”</p><p> “Crawfurd. Well, Crawfurd, you have</p><p>been the little reef on which a great vessel </p><p>has foundered. You stole the Collar and </p><p>cut me off from my people, and then when </p><p>I was weary the Portuguese killed me.” </p><p> “ No,” I cried, “ it was not 11 You trusted</p><p>Henriques and you got your fingers on his </p><p>neck^too late. Don’t say I didn’t warn </p><p>you.” </p><p> “You warned me and I shall repay you.</p><p>I will make you rich, Crawfurd. You are </p><p>a trader and want money. I am a king and </p><p>want a throne. But I am dying and there </p><p>will be no more kings in Africa.” </p><p> The mention of riches did not thrill me as</p><p>I had expected, but the last words awakened </p><p>a wild regret. I was hypnotized by the </p><p>man. To see him going out was like seeing </p><p>the fall of a great mountain. </p><p> He stretched himself, gasping, and in the</p><p>growing light I could see how broken he was. </p><p>His cheeks were falling in, and his somber </p><p>eyes had shrunk back in their sockets. He </p><p>seemed an old, worn man standing there </p><p>among the ashes, while the blood, which he </p><p>made no effort to stanch, trickled down his </p><p>side till it dripped on the floor. He had </p><p>ceased to be the Kaffir king or the Christian </p><p>minister, or indeed any one of his former </p><p>parts. Death was stripping hi® to his ele- </p><p>ments, and the man Laputa stood out be- </p><p>yond and above the characters he had </p><p>played, something strange and great and </p><p>moving and terrible. </p><p> “We met for the first time three days</p><p>ago,” he said, “and now you will be the last </p><p>to see the Inkulu.” </p><p> “Umvelos’ was not our first meeting,”</p><p>I said. “Do you mind the Sabbath eight </p><p>years since when you preached in the Free </p><p>Kirk at Kirkcaple? I was the boy you </p><p>chased from the shore, and I flung the</p><p>stone that blacked your eye. Besides, I </p><p>came out from England with you and </p><p>Henriques and I was in the boat which took </p><p>you from Durban to Delagoa Bay. You </p><p>and I have been long acquainted, Mr. </p><p>Laputa.” </p><p> “It is the hand of God,” he said solemnly.</p><p>“Your fate has been twisted with mine, and </p><p>now you will die with me.” </p><p> I did not understand this talk about</p><p>dying. I was not mortally wounded like </p><p>him, and I did not think Laputa had the </p><p>strength to kill me even if he wished. But </p><p>my mind was so impassive that I scarcely </p><p>regarded his words. </p><p>304 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “I will make you rich,” he cried. “ Craw-</p><p>furd, the storekeeper, will be the richest </p><p>man in Africa. We are scattered and our </p><p>wealth is another’s. He shall have the gold </p><p>and the diamonds—all but the Collar, </p><p>which goes with me!” </p><p> He staggered into a dark recess, one of</p><p>many in the Cave, and I followed him. </p><p>There were boxes there,^ tea-chests, cart- </p><p>ridge-cases and old brass-ribbed Portuguese </p><p>coffers. Laputa had keys at his belt, and </p><p>unlocked them, his-fingers fumbling with </p><p>weakness. I peered in and saw gold coin </p><p>and little bags of stones. </p><p> “Money and diamonds!” he cried.</p><p>“Once it was the war-chest of a king, and </p><p>now it will be the hoard of a trader! No! by </p><p>the Lord! The trader’s place is with the </p><p>Terrible Ones!” An arm shot out and my </p><p>shoulder was fiercely gripped. “You stole </p><p>my horse I That is why I am dying. But </p><p>for you I and my army would be over the </p><p>Olifants! I am going to kill you, Craw- </p><p>furd!” And his fingers closed in to my </p><p>shoulder-blades. </p><p> Still I was unperturbed. “No, you are</p><p>not. You can not. You have tried to and </p><p>failed. So did Henriques, and he is lying </p><p>dead outside. I am in God’s keeping and </p><p>can not die before my time.” </p><p> I do not know whether he heard me, but</p><p>at any rate the murderous fit passed. His </p><p>hand fell to his side and his great figure tot- </p><p>tered out into the cave. He seemed to be </p><p>making for the river, but he turned and </p><p>went through the door I had entered by, </p><p>I heard him slipping in the passage, and </p><p>then there was a minute of silence. </p><p> Suddenly there came a grinding sound,</p><p>followed by the kind of muffled splash that </p><p>a stone makes when it falls into a deep well.</p><p>I thought Laputa had fallen into the chasm, </p><p>but when I reached the door his swaying </p><p>figure was coming out of the corridor. Then </p><p>I knew what he had done. He had used the </p><p>remnant of his giant strength to break down </p><p>the bridge of stone across the gorge and so </p><p>cut off my retreat! </p><p> I REALLY did not care. Even if</p><p>I had got over the bridge I should </p><p>probably have been foiled by the </p><p>shut turnstile. I had quite forgotten the </p><p>meaning of fear of death. I found myself </p><p>giving my arm to the man who bad tried to </p><p>destroy me. </p><p> “I have laid up for you treasure in</p><p>heaven,” he said. “Your earthly treasure </p><p>is in the boxes, but soon you will be seeking </p><p>incorruptible jewels in the deep, deep water. </p><p>It is cool and quiet down there, and you </p><p>forget the hunger and pain.” </p><p> The man was getting very near his end.</p><p>The madness of despair Came back to him </p><p>and he flung himself among the ashes. </p><p> “ We are going to die together, Crawfurd! ”</p><p>he said. “ God has twined our threads, and </p><p>there will be only one cutting! Tell me </p><p>what has become of my army? ” </p><p> “Arcoll has guns on the Wolksberg,”</p><p>I said. “They must submit or perish.” </p><p> “I have other armies—no, no, they are</p><p>nothing! They will all wander and blunder </p><p>and fight and be beaten. There is no leader </p><p>anywhere—and I am dying!” </p><p>• There was no gainsaying the signs o£ </p><p>death. I asked him if he would like water, </p><p>but he made no answer. His eyes were </p><p>fixed on vacancy, and I thought I could </p><p>realize something of the bitterness of that </p><p>great regret. For myself, I was as cold as </p><p>a stone. I had no exultation of triumph, </p><p>still less any fear of my own fate. I stood </p><p>silent, the half-remorseful spectator of fall </p><p>like the fall of Lucifer. </p><p> “I would have taught the world wisdcttn.”</p><p>Laputa was speaking English in a strange, </p><p>thin, abstracted voice. “ There would have </p><p>been no king like me since Charlemagne!” </p><p>and he strayed into Latin, which I have been </p><p>told since was an adaptation of the Epitaph </p><p>of Charles the Great. “Sub hoc condi- </p><p>torio,” he crooned, “ situm est carpus Joannis, </p><p>magni et orthodoxi Imperatoris, qui imperium </p><p>Africanum nobiliter ampliavit, et multos per </p><p>antws munduni feliciter rexit.” [“Under </p><p>this monument is laid the body of John, </p><p>great and orthodox Emperor, who nobly </p><p>extended the Empire of Africa and ruled the </p><p>world happily for many years.”] He must</p><p>have chosen this epitaph long ago. </p><p> He lay for a few seconds with his head on</p><p>his arms, his breast heaving with agony. </p><p> “No one will come after me. My race is</p><p>doomed, and in a little they will have for- </p><p>gotten my name. I alone could have saved </p><p>them. Now they go the way of the rest, </p><p>and the warriors of John become drudges </p><p>and slaves!” </p><p> Something clicked in his throat, he gasped</p><p>and fell forward, and I thought he was dead. </p><p>Then he struggled as if to rise. I ran for- </p><p>ward and with all my strength aided him to </p><p>his feet. </p><p>Preater John </p><p>305 </p><p> “Unarm!” he cried “The long day’s</p><p>task is done!” With the strange power oi </p><p>a dying man he tore off his leopard-skin and </p><p>belt till he stood stark as on the night when </p><p>he had been crowned. From his pouch he </p><p>took the Prester’s Collar. Then he stag- </p><p>gered to the brink of the chasm where the </p><p>wall of green water dropped into the dark </p><p>depth below. </p><p> I watched, fascinated, as with the weak</p><p>hands of a child he twined the rubies round </p><p>his neck and joined the clasp. Then with </p><p>a last eSort he stood straight up on the </p><p>brink, his eyes raised to the belt of daylight </p><p>from which the water fell. The light caught </p><p>the great gems and called fires from them, </p><p>the flames of the funeral pyre of a king. </p><p> Once more his voice, restored for a mo*</p><p>ment to its old vigor, rang out through the </p><p>cave above the din of the cascade. His </p><p>words were those the Keeper had used three </p><p>nights before. With his hands held high and </p><p>ihe Collar burning on his neck he cried, “ The </p><p>Snake returns to the House of its Birth!” </p><p>“Come!” he cried to me. “The Heir of </p><p>John is going home!” </p><p> Then he leaped into the gulf, There was</p><p>no sound of falling, so great was the rush of </p><p>water. He must have been whirled into the </p><p>open, below where the bridge used to be, and </p><p>then swept into the underground deeps, </p><p>where the Labonga drowses for fifty miles. </p><p>Far from human quest he sleeps his last </p><p>sleep, and perchance on a fragment of bone </p><p>washed into a crevice of rock there may </p><p>hang the jewels that once gleamed in </p><p>Sheba’s hair. </p><p>CHAPTER XXIX </p><p> 1 CLIMB THE CRAGS A SECOND TIME</p><p>T REMEMBER that I looked over </p><p>the brink into the yeasty abyss </p><p>with a mind hovering between perplexity</p><p>and tears. 1 wanted to sit down and </p><p>cry—why, I did not know, except that </p><p>some great thing had happened. My </p><p>brain was quite clear as to my own posi- </p><p>tion. I was shut in in this place with no </p><p>chance of escape and with no food. In a, </p><p>little while I must die of starvation or go </p><p>mad and throw myself after Laputa. And </p><p>yet I did not care a rush. My nerves had </p><p>been tried too greatly in the past week. </p><p>Now I was comatose, and beyond hoping </p><p>or fearing. </p><p> 1 sat for a long time watching the light</p><p>play on the fretted sheet of water and won- </p><p>dering where Laputa’s body had gone. </p><p>I shivered and wished he had not left me </p><p>alone, for the darkness would come in time </p><p>and I had no matches. After a little I </p><p>got tired of doing nothing and went feel- </p><p>ing among the treasure-chests. One or </p><p>two were full of &amp;oin—British sovereigns, </p><p>Kruger sovereigns, Napoleons, Spanish and </p><p>Portuguese gold-pieces, and many older </p><p>coins ranging back to the Middle Ages and </p><p>even to the ancients. In one handful there </p><p>was a splendid gold stater and in another </p><p>a piece of Antoninus Pius. The treasure </p><p>had been collected for many years in many </p><p>places, contributions of chiefs from ancient </p><p>hoards as well as the cash received from </p><p>I. D. B. </p><p> I untied one or two of the little bags oi</p><p>stones and poured the contents into my </p><p>hands. Most of the diamonds were small, </p><p>such as a laborer might secrete on his per- </p><p>son. The larger ones—and some were very- </p><p>large—were as a rule discolored, looking </p><p>more like big cairngorms. But one or two </p><p>bags had big stones which even my inex- </p><p>perienced eye told me were of the purest </p><p>water. There must be some new pipe, I </p><p>thought, for these could not have been </p><p>stolen from any known mine. </p><p> After that I sat on the floor again and</p><p>looked at the water. It exercised a mes- </p><p>meric influence on me, soothing all care, </p><p>I was quite happy to wait for death, for </p><p>death had no meaning to me. My hate </p><p>and fury were both lulled into a trance, </p><p>since the passive is the next stage to the </p><p>overwrought. </p><p> It must have been full day outside now,</p><p>for the funnel was bright with sunshine, and </p><p>even the dim cave caught a reflected radi- </p><p>ance. As I watched the river I saw a bird </p><p>flash downward, skimming the water. It </p><p>turned into the cave and fluttered among its </p><p>dark recesses. I heard its wings beating the</p><p>roof as it sought wildly for an outlet. It </p><p>dashed into the spray of the cataract and </p><p>escaped again into the cave. For maybe </p><p>twenty minutes it fluttered, till at last it </p><p>found the way it had entered by. With </p><p>a dart it sped up the funnel of rock into </p><p>light and freedom. </p><p> I had begun to watch the bird in idle las-</p><p>situde; I ended in keen excitement. The </p><p>sight of it seemed to take a film from my </p><p>eyes. I realized the zest of liberty, the pas- </p><p>* </p><p>3°6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>sion of life again. I felt that beyond this </p><p>dim underworld there was the great joyous </p><p>earth, and I longed for it I wanted to live </p><p>now. </p><p> My memory cleared and I remembered all</p><p>that had befallen me during the last few </p><p>days. I had played the chief part in the </p><p>whole business, and I had won! Laputa </p><p>was dead and the treasure was mine, while </p><p>Arcoll was crushing the Rising at his ease. </p><p>I had only to be free again to be famous and </p><p>rich. My hopes had returned, but with </p><p>them came my fears. What if I could not </p><p>escape? I must perish miserably by de- </p><p>grees, shut in the heart of a hill, though my </p><p>friends were out for rescue! I was now in </p><p>a fever of unrest </p><p>MY FIRST care was to explore the </p><p>way I had come. I ran down the </p><p>passage to the chasm which the slab </p><p>of stone had spanned. I had been right in </p><p>my guess, for the thing was gone. Laputa </p><p>was, in truth, a titan, who in the article of </p><p>death could break down a bridge that would </p><p>have taken any three men an hour to shift. </p><p>The gorge was about seven yards wide, too </p><p>far to risk a jump, and the cliff fell sheer and </p><p>smooth to the imprisoned waters two hun- </p><p>dred feet below. There was no chance of cir- </p><p>cuiting it, for the wall was as smooth as if it </p><p>had been chiseled. The hand of man had </p><p>been at work to make the sanctuary in- </p><p>violable. </p><p> It occurred to me that sooner or later</p><p>Arcoll would track Laputa to this place. </p><p>He would find the blood-stains in the gully, </p><p>but the turnstile would be shut and he </p><p>would never find the trick of it. Nor could </p><p>he have any Kaffirs with him who knew the </p><p>secret of the Place of the Snake. Still, if </p><p>Arcoll knew I was inside he would find some </p><p>way to get to me even though he had to </p><p>dynamite the curtain of rock. I shouted, </p><p>but my voice seemed to be drowned in the</p><p>roar of the water. It made but a fresh </p><p>chord in the wild orchestra, and I gave up </p><p>hopes in that direction. </p><p> Very dolefully I returned to the cave.</p><p>I was about to share the experience of all </p><p>treasure-hunters—to be left with jewels </p><p>galore and not a bite to sustain life. The </p><p>thing was too commonplace to be endured. </p><p>I grew angry and declined so obvious a fate. </p><p>I had come through worse dangers, and </p><p>a way I should find. To starve in the cave </p><p>was no ending for David Crawfurd. Far </p><p>better to join Laputa in the depths in </p><p>a manly hazard for liberty! </p><p> My obstinacy and irritation cheered me.</p><p>What had become of the lack-luster young </p><p>fool who had mooned here a few minutes </p><p>back? Now I was as tense and strung for </p><p>effort as the day I had ridden from Blaau- </p><p>wildebeestefontein to Umvolos’. I felt like </p><p>a runner in the last lap of a race. For four </p><p>days I had lived in the midst of terror and </p><p>darkness. Daylight was only a few steps </p><p>ahead, daylight and youth restored and </p><p>a new world. </p><p> There were only two outlets from that</p><p>cave—the way I had come and the way the </p><p>river came. The first was closed, the second </p><p>a sheer, staring impossibility. I had been </p><p>into every niche and cranny, and there was </p><p>no sign of a passage. I sat down on the </p><p>floor and looked at the wall of water. It </p><p>fell, as I have already explained, in a solid </p><p>sheet, which made up the whole of the wall </p><p>of the cave. Higher than the roof of the </p><p>cave I could not see what happened, except </p><p>that it must be the open air, for the sun was </p><p>shining on it. The water was about three </p><p>yards distant from the edge of the cave’s </p><p>floor, but it seemed to me that high up </p><p>this distance decreased to little more than </p><p>a foot. </p><p> I could not see what the walls of the cave</p><p>were like, but they looked smooth and diffi- </p><p>cult. Supposing I managed to climb up to </p><p>the level of the roof close to the water, how </p><p>on earth was I to get outside on to the wall </p><p>of the ravine? I knew from my old days of </p><p>rock-climbing what a complete obstacle the </p><p>overhang of a cave is. </p><p> While I looked, however, I saw a thing</p><p>I had not noticed before. On the left side </p><p>of the fall the water sluiced down in a sheet </p><p>to the extreme edge of the cave, almost </p><p>sprinkling the floor with water. But on the </p><p>right side the force of water was obviously </p><p>weaker, and a little short of the level of the </p><p>cave roof there was a spike of rock which</p><p>slightly broke the fall. The spike was cov- </p><p>ered, but the covering was shallow, for the </p><p>current flowed from it in a rose-shaped </p><p>spray. If a man could get to that spike </p><p>and could get a foot on it without being </p><p>swept down, it might be possible—just </p><p>possible—to do something with the well </p><p>of the chasm above the cave. Of course </p><p>I knew nothing about the nature of that </p><p>well. It might be as smooth as a pol- </p><p>ished pillar. </p><p>Prtsi.er John </p><p>3&lt;&gt;7 </p><p>THE result of these cogitations was </p><p>that I decided to prospect the right </p><p>wall of the cave close to the water- </p><p>fall. But first I went rummaging in the </p><p>back part to see if I could find anything to </p><p>assist me. In one corner there was a rude </p><p>cupboard with some stone and metal ves- </p><p>sels. Here, too, were the few domestic </p><p>utensils of the dead Keeper. In another </p><p>were several locked coffers on which I could </p><p>make no impression. There were the treas- </p><p>ure-chests, too, but they held nothing save </p><p>treasure, and gold and diamonds were no </p><p>manner of use to me. Other odds and ends </p><p>I found—spears, a few skins, and a broken </p><p>and notched ax. I took the ax in case there </p><p>might be cutting to do. </p><p> Then at the back of a bin my hand struck</p><p>something that brought the blood to my </p><p>face. It was a rope, an old one, but still in </p><p>fair condition and forty or fifty feet long. </p><p>I dragged it out into the light and straight- </p><p>ened out its kinks. With this something </p><p>could be done, assuming I could cut my </p><p>way to the level of the roof. </p><p> I began to climb in my bare feet, and at</p><p>the beginning it was very bad. Except on </p><p>the very edge of the abyss there was </p><p>scarcely a handhold. Possibly in floods the </p><p>waters may have swept the wall in a curve, </p><p>smoothing down the inner part and leaving </p><p>the outer to its natural roughness. There </p><p>was one place where I had to hang on by </p><p>a very narrow crack, while I scraped with </p><p>the ax a hollow for my right foot. And </p><p>then about twelve feet from the ground I </p><p>struck the first of the iron pegs. </p><p> To this day I can not think what these</p><p>pegs were for. They were - old square- </p><p>headed things which had seen the wear of </p><p>centuries. They can not have been meant </p><p>to assist a climber, for the dwellers of the </p><p>cave had clearly never contemplated this </p><p>means of egress. Perhaps they had been </p><p>used for some kind, of ceremonial curtain</p><p>in a dim past. They were rusty and frail, </p><p>and one of them came away in my hand, but </p><p>for all that they marvelously assisted my </p><p>ascent. </p><p> I had been climbing slowly, doggedly and.</p><p>carefully, my mind wholly occupied with </p><p>the task; and, almost before I knew, I found </p><p>ivy head close under the roof of the cave. </p><p>It was necessary now to move towards the </p><p>river and the task seemed impossible. </p><p>I could see no footholds, save two frail pegs, </p><p>and in the corner between the wall and the </p><p>roof was a rough arch too wide for a body to </p><p>jam itself in. Just below the level of the </p><p>roof—say two feet—I saw the submerged </p><p>spike of rock. The waters raged around </p><p>it and could not have been more than an </p><p>inch deep on the top. If I could only get </p><p>my foot on that, I believed I could avoid </p><p>being swept down and stand up and reach </p><p>for the well above»the cave. </p><p> But how to get to it? It was no good</p><p>delaying, for my frail holds might give at </p><p>any moment. In any case I would have the </p><p>moral security of the rope, so I passed it </p><p>through a fairly stanch pin close to the roof, </p><p>which had an upward tilt that almost made </p><p>a ring of it. One end of the rope was round </p><p>my body, the other was loose in my hand, </p><p>and 1 paid it out as I moved. Moral sup- </p><p>port is something. Very gingerly I crawled </p><p>like a fly along the wall, my fingers now </p><p>clutching at a tiny knob, now clawing at. </p><p>a crack which did little more than hold my </p><p>nails. It was all hopeless insanity, and yet </p><p>somehow I did it. The rope and the near- </p><p>ness of the roof gave me confidence and </p><p>balance. </p><p> Then the holds ceased altogether a couplc</p><p>of yards from the water. I saw my spike of </p><p>rock a trifle below me. There was nothing </p><p>for it but to risk all on a jump. I drew the </p><p>rope out of the hitch, twined the slack </p><p>round my waist, and leaped for the spike, </p><p>CHAPTER XXX </p><p>THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF </p><p>IT WAS like throwing oneself on a line </p><p>of spears. The solid wall of water </p><p>hurled me back and down, but as I fell </p><p>my arms closed on the spike. There J </p><p>hung while my feet were towed outward:; </p><p>by the volume of the stream-as if they had </p><p>been dead leaves. I was half stunned by </p><p>the shock of the drip on my head, but I </p><p>kept my wits and presently got my face </p><p>outside the falling sheet and breathed. </p><p> To get to my feet and stand on the spike</p><p>while all that fury of water was plucking at</p><p>me was the hardest physical effort I have </p><p>ever made. It had to be done very cir- </p><p>cumspectly, for a slip would send me into </p><p>the abyss. If I moved an arm or a leg an </p><p>inch too near the terrible dropping wail </p><p>I knew I should be plucked from my hold. </p><p>I got my knees on the outer face of the spike, </p><p>so that all my body was removed as far as </p><p>308 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>possible from the impact of the water. </p><p>Then I began to pull myself slowly up. </p><p> I could not do it. If I got my feet on the</p><p>rock the effort would bring me too far into </p><p>the water and that meant destruction. </p><p>I saw this clearly in a second while my </p><p>wrists were cracking with the effort. But </p><p>if I had a wall behind me I could reach back </p><p>with one hand and get what we call in Scot- </p><p>land a “stell.” I knew there was a wall, </p><p>but how far I could not judge. The per- </p><p>petual hammering of the stream had con- </p><p>fused my wits. </p><p> It was a horrible moment, but I had to</p><p>risk it. I knew that if the wall was too far </p><p>back I should fall, for I had to let my weight </p><p>go till my hand fell on it. Delay would do </p><p>no good, so with a prayer I flung my right </p><p>hand back, while my left hand clutched the </p><p>spike. </p><p> I found the wall—it was only a foot or</p><p>two beyond my reach. With a heave I had </p><p>my foot on the spike and, turning, had both </p><p>hands on the opposite wall. There I stood, </p><p>straddling like a Colossus over a waste of </p><p>white waters, with the cave floor far below </p><p>me in the gloom and my discarded ax lying </p><p>close to a splash of Laputa’s blood. </p><p> The spectacle made me giddy, and I had</p><p>to move on or fall. The wall was not quite </p><p>perpendicular, but, as far as I could see, </p><p>a slope of about 6o°. It was ribbed and </p><p>terraced pretty fully, but I could see no </p><p>ledge within reach that offered standing- </p><p>room. Once more I tried the moral support </p><p>of the rope and, as well as I could, dropped </p><p>a noose on the spike, which might hold me </p><p>if I fell. </p><p> Then I boldly embarked on a hard trav-</p><p>erse, pulling myself along a little ledge till </p><p>I was right in the angle of the fall. Here </p><p>happily the water was shallower and less </p><p>violent, and with my legs up to the knees in </p><p>foam I managed to scramble into a kind of </p><p>corner. Now at last I was on the side of the </p><p>gully, and above the cave. I had achieved </p><p>by amazing luck one of the most difficult of </p><p>all mountaineering operations. I had got</p><p>out of a cave to the wall above. </p><p>MY TROUBLES were by no means </p><p>over, for I found the cliff most diffi- </p><p>cult to climb. The great rush of the </p><p>stream confused my brain, the spray made </p><p>the rock damp, and the slope steepened as </p><p>I advanced. At one overhang my shoulder </p><p>was almost in the water again. All this. </p><p>time I was climbing doggedly, with terror, </p><p>somewhere in my soul, and hope lighting but </p><p>a feeble lamp. I was very distrustful of </p><p>my body, for I knew that at any moment </p><p>my weakness might return. The fever of </p><p>three days of peril and stress is not allayed </p><p>by one night’s rest. </p><p> By this time I was high enough to see that</p><p>the river came out of the ground about fifty </p><p>feet short of the lip of the gully and some ten </p><p>feet beyond where I stood. Above the hole </p><p>whence the waters came was a loose slope of </p><p>slabs and screes. It looked an ugly place, </p><p>but there I must go, for the rock-wall I was </p><p>on was getting unclimbable. </p><p> I turned the corner a foot or two above</p><p>the water, and stood on a slope of about 50° </p><p>running from the parapet of stone to a line </p><p>beyond which blue sky appeared. The </p><p>first step I took, the place began to move, </p><p>A boulder crashed into the fall and tore- </p><p>down into the abyss with a shattering thun- </p><p>der. I lay flat and clutched desperately at </p><p>every scrub, but I had loosened an avalanche </p><p>of earth, and not till my feet were sprayed </p><p>by the water did I get a grip of firm rock and </p><p>check my descent. All this frightened me </p><p>horribly, with the kind of despairing, angry </p><p>fear I had suffered at Bruderstoon when </p><p>I dreamed that the treasure was lost. I </p><p>could not bear the notion of death when </p><p>I had won so far. </p><p> After that I advanced not by steps but by</p><p>inches. I felt more poised and pinnacled in </p><p>the void than when I had stood on the spike </p><p>of rock, for I had a substantial hold neither </p><p>for foot nor hand. It seemed weeks before </p><p>I made any progress away from the lip of the </p><p>water-hole. I dared not look down, but </p><p>kept my eyes on the slope before me, search- </p><p>ing for any patch of ground that promised </p><p>stability. Once I found a scrog of juniper </p><p>with firm roots, and this gave me a great </p><p>lift. A little farther, however, I lit on a </p><p>bank of screes which slipped with me to the </p><p>right and I lost most of the ground the bush </p><p>had gained me. My whole being, I remem- </p><p>ber, was filled with a devouring passion to be </p><p>quit of this gully and all that was in it. </p><p> Then, not suddenly as in romances, but</p><p>after hard striving and hope long deferred; </p><p>I found myself on a firm outcrop of weathered </p><p>stone. In three strides I was on the edge of </p><p>the plateau. Then I began to run and at </p><p>the same time to lose the power of running. </p><p>I cast one look behind me and saw a deep </p><p>cleft of darkness out of which I had climbed. </p><p>Prester John </p><p>309 </p><p>■Down in the cave it had seemed light </p><p>enough, but in the clear sunshine of the top </p><p>the gorge looked a very pit of shade. For </p><p>the first and last time in my life I had ver- </p><p>tigo. Fear of falling back and a mad craze </p><p>to do it made me actually sick. I managed </p><p>to stumble a few steps forward on the moun- </p><p>tain turf, and then flung myself on my face. </p><p>WHEN I raised my head I was </p><p>amazed to find it still early morning. </p><p>1 The dew was yet on the grass, and </p><p>the sun was not far up. the sky. I had </p><p>thought that my entry into the cave, my </p><p>time in it, and my escape had taken many </p><p>hours, whereas at the most they had occu- </p><p>pied two. It was little more than dawn— </p><p>such a dawn as walks only on the hilltops. </p><p>Before me was the shallow vale with its </p><p>bracken and sweet grass, and the shining </p><p>links of the stream, and the loch still gray in </p><p>the shadow of the beleaguering hills. Here </p><p>was a fresh, clean land, a land of home- </p><p>steads and orchards and children. All of </p><p>a sudden I realized that at last I had come </p><p>out of savagery. </p><p> The burden of the past days slipped from</p><p>my shoulders. I felt young again, and </p><p>cheerful and brave. Behind me were the </p><p>black night and the horrid secrets of dark- </p><p>ness. Before me was my own country, for </p><p>that loch and that bracken might have been </p><p>on a Scotch moor. The fresh scent of the </p><p>air and the whole morning mystery put song </p><p>into my blood. I remembered that I was </p><p>not yet twenty. </p><p> My first care was to kneel there among</p><p>the bracken and give thanks to my Maker, </p><p>Who in very truth had shown me “His good- </p><p>ness in the land of the living.” </p><p> After a little I went back to the edge of</p><p>the cliff. There, where the road came out </p><p>of the bush, was the sprawled body of </p><p>Henriques, with two dismounted riders </p><p>looking hard at it. I gave a great shout, </p><p>for in the men I recognized Aitken and the </p><p>schoolmaster Wardlaw. </p><p>CHAPTER XXXI </p><p>I GO AGAIN TO TNANDA’S KRAAL </p><p>I MUST now take up some of the rag-</p><p>ged ends that I have left . behind me. </p><p>It. is not my task, as I have said,” to </p><p>write the history of the great Rising. </p><p>That has been done by abler men, who </p><p>were at the center of the business and had </p><p>some knowledge of strategy and tactics, </p><p>whereas I was only a raw lad who was </p><p>privileged by fate to see the start. If I </p><p>could, I would fain make an epic of it, </p><p>and show how the Plains found at all </p><p>points the Plateau guarded, how wits over- </p><p>came numbers, and at every pass which the </p><p>natives, tried the great guns spoke and the </p><p>tide rolled back. </p><p> Yet I fear it would be an epic without</p><p>a hero. There was no leader left when </p><p>Laputa had gone. There were months of </p><p>guerrilla fighting, and then months of re- </p><p>prisals, when chief after chief was hunted </p><p>down and brought to trial. Then the am- </p><p>nesty came and a clean sheet, and whitt </p><p>Africa drew breath again with certain grave </p><p>reflections left in her head. </p><p> On the whole I am not sorry that the his-</p><p>tory is no business Of mine. Romance died </p><p>with “ the Heir of John,” and the crusade </p><p>became a sorry mutiny. I can fancy how </p><p>differently Laputa would have managed it </p><p>all, had he lived; how swift and sudden his </p><p>plans would have been; how under him the </p><p>fighting would not have been in the moun- </p><p>tain glens but far into the high-veld among </p><p>the dorps and townships. With the Inkulu </p><p>alive we warred against odds; with the In- </p><p>kulu dead the balance sank heavily in our </p><p>favor. I leave to others the marches and </p><p>strategy of the thing and hasten to clear up </p><p>the obscure parts in my own fortunes. </p><p> Arcoll received my message from Um-</p><p>velos’ by Colin, or rather Wardlaw received </p><p>it and sent it on to the post on the Berg </p><p>where the leader had gone. Close on its </p><p>heels came the message from Henriques by </p><p>a Shangaan in his pay. It must have been </p><p>sent off before the Portuguese got to the </p><p>Rooirand, from which it would appear that </p><p>he had his own men in the bush near the </p><p>store and that I was lucky to get off as I did. </p><p> Arcoll might have disregarded Henriques’</p><p>news as a trap if it had come alone, but my </p><p>corroboration impressed and perplexed him. </p><p>He began to credit the Portuguese with </p><p>treachery, but he had no inclination to act </p><p>on his message, since it conflicted with hif </p><p>plans. He knew that Laputa must come </p><p>into the Berg sooner or later, and he had </p><p>resolved that his strategy must be to await </p><p>him there.</p><p> But there was the question of my life.</p><p>He had every reason to believe that I was in </p><p>the greatest danger, and he felt a certain </p><p>3io </p><p>Adventure </p><p>responsibility for my fate. With the few </p><p>!cen at his disposal he could not hope to </p><p>hold up the great Kaffir army, but there was </p><p>a chance that he might by a bold stand </p><p>effect my rescue. Henriques had told him </p><p>of the Vow, and had told him that Laputa </p><p>would ride in the center of the force. A </p><p>body of men well posted at Dupree’s Drift </p><p>might split the army at the crossing, and </p><p>under cover of the fire I might swim the </p><p>river and join my friends. Still relying on </p><p>the Vow, it might be possible for well- </p><p>mounted men to evade capture. </p><p> Accordingly he called for volunteers, and</p><p>sent off one of his Kaffirs to warn me of his </p><p>design. He led his men in person, and of </p><p>his doings the reader already knows the tale. </p><p>But though the crossing was flung into con- </p><p>fusion, and the rear of the army were com- </p><p>pelled to follow the northerly bank of the </p><p>Letaba, there was no sign of me anywhere. </p><p>Arcoll searched the river-banks and crossed </p><p>the Drift to where the old Keeper was lying </p><p>dead. He then concluded that I had been </p><p>murdered early on the march, and his Kaf- </p><p>fir, who might have given him news of me, </p><p>was carried up the stream in the tide of the </p><p>disorderly army. Therefore he and his men </p><p>rode back with all haste to the Berg by way </p><p>of Main Drift, and reached Bruderstoon be- </p><p>fore Laputa had crossed the highway. </p><p>MY INFORMATION about In- </p><p>anda’s Kraal decided Arcoll’s next </p><p>move. Like me, he remembered </p><p>Beyer's performance and resolved to repeat </p><p>it. lie had no hope of catching Laputa, </p><p>but he thought that he might hold up the </p><p>bulk of his force if he got guns on the ridge </p><p>above the kraal. A message had already </p><p>been sent for guns, and the first to arrive got </p><p>to Bruderstoon about the hour when I was </p><p>being taken by Machudi’s men in the kloof. </p><p>The ceremony of the Purification pre- </p><p>vented Laputa from keeping a good lookout, </p><p>and the result was that a way was made for </p><p>the guns on the northwestern comer of the </p><p>rampart of rock. It was the way that </p><p>Beyers had taken, and indeed the enterprise </p><p>was directed by one of Beyer’s old com- </p><p>mandants. </p><p> All that day the work continued, while</p><p>Laputa and I were traveling to Machudi’s. </p><p>Then came the evening when I staggered</p><p>into camp and told my news. Arcoll, who </p><p>alone knew how vital Laputa was to the </p><p>success of the insurrection, immediately de- </p><p>cided to suspend all other operations and </p><p>devote himself to shepherding the leader </p><p>away from his army. How the scheme suc- </p><p>ceeded and what befell Laputa the reader </p><p>has already been told. </p><p> Aitken and Wardlaw, when I descended</p><p>from the cliffs, took me straight to Blaau- </p><p>wildebeestefontein. I was like a man who </p><p>is recovering from bad fever, cured, but </p><p>weak and foolish, and it was a slow journey </p><p>that I made to Umvelos’, riding on Aitken’s </p><p>pony. At Umvelos’ we found a picket who </p><p>had captured the schimmcl by the roadside. </p><p>The wise beast, when I turned him loose at </p><p>the entrance to the cave, had trotted quietly </p><p>back the way he had come. </p><p> At Umvelos’ Aitken left me, and next day,</p><p>with Wardlaw as companion, I rode up the </p><p>glen of the Klein Labonga, and came in the </p><p>afternoon to my old home. The store was </p><p>empty, for Japp some days before had gone </p><p>off post-haste to Pietersdorp; but there was </p><p>Zeeta clearing up the place as if war had </p><p>never been heard of. I slept the night </p><p>there, and in the morning found myself so </p><p>much recovered that I was eager to get away. </p><p>I wanted to see Arcoll about many things, </p><p>but mainly about the treasure |in the cave. </p><p> It was an easy journey to Bruderstoon</p><p>through the meadows of the Plateau. The </p><p>farmers’ commandoes had been recalled, but </p><p>the ashes of their camp-fires were still gray </p><p>among the bracken. I fell in with a police </p><p>patrol and was taken by them to a spot on </p><p>the Upper Letaba, some miles west of the </p><p>camp, where we found Arcoll at a late break- </p><p>fast. I had resolved to take him fully into </p><p>my confidence, so I told him the full tale of </p><p>my night’s adventure. He was very severe </p><p>with me, I remember, for my daft-like ride, </p><p>but his severity relaxed before I had done </p><p>with my story. </p><p> The telling brought back the scene to me,</p><p>and I shivered at the picture of the cave </p><p>with the morning breaking through the veil </p><p>of water and Laputa in his death-throes. </p><p>Arcoll did not speak for some time. </p><p> “So he is dead,” he said at last, hah"</p><p>whispering to himself. “Well, he was a </p><p>king, and died like a king! Our job now is </p><p>simple, for there are none of his breed left in </p><p>Africa!” </p><p> Then I told him of the treasure.</p><p> “It belongs to you, Davie,” he said, “and</p><p>we must see that you get it. This is going</p><p>to be a long war, but if we survive to the end </p><p>you will be a rich man.” </p><p>Prester John </p><p>3ii </p><p> “But in the meantime?” I asked. “Sup-</p><p>posing other Kaffirs hear of it, and come back </p><p>and make a bridge over the gorge? They </p><p>may be doing it now.” _ </p><p> “I’ll put a guard on it,” he said, jumping</p><p>iip briskly. “It’s maybe not a soldier’s </p><p>job, but you’ve saved this country, Davie, </p><p>and I’m going to make sure that you have </p><p>your reward!” </p><p> AFTER that 1 went with Arcoll to</p><p>Inanda’s Kraal. I am not going to </p><p>tell the story of that performance, </p><p>for it occupies no less than two chapters in </p><p>Mr. Upton’s book. He makes one or two </p><p>blunders, for he spells my name with an </p><p>“o,” and he says we walked out of the camp </p><p>on our perilous mission “with faces white </p><p>and set as a Crusader’s.” This is certainly </p><p>not true, for in the first place nobody saw us </p><p>go who could judge how we looked, and in </p><p>the second place we were both smoking and </p><p>feeling quite cheerfuL At home they made </p><p>a great fuss about it and started a news- </p><p>paper cry about the Victoria Cross, but the </p><p>danger was not so terrible after all, and in </p><p>any case it was nothing to what I had been </p><p>through in the past week. </p><p> I take credit to myself for suggesting the</p><p>idea. By this time we had the army in the </p><p>kraal at our mercy. Laputa not having </p><p>returned, they had no plans. It had been </p><p>the original intention to start for the Oli- </p><p>fants on the following day, so there was </p><p>a scanty supply of food. Besides, there </p><p>were the makings of a pretty quarrel be- </p><p>tween Umbooni and some of the north- </p><p>country chiefs, and I verily believe that if we </p><p>had held them tight there for a week they </p><p>would have destroyed each other in faction </p><p>fights. </p><p> In a little they would have grown des-</p><p>perate and tried to rush the approaches on </p><p>the north and south. Then we must either </p><p>have used guns on them, which would have </p><p>meant a great slaughter, or let them go to do </p><p>mischief elsewhere. Arcoll was a merciful </p><p>man who had no love for butcher)'; besides, </p><p>he was a statesman with an eye to the future </p><p>of the country after the war. But it was his </p><p>duty to isolate Laputa’s army, and at all </p><p>costs it must be prevented from joining any </p><p>of the concentrations of the south. </p><p> Then I proposed to him to do as Rhodes</p><p>did in the Matoppos, and go and talk to</p><p>them. By this time, I argued, the influence </p><p>of Laputa must have sunk and the fervor of </p><p>the Purification be half forgotten. The </p><p>army had little food and no leader. The </p><p>rank and file had never been fanatical, and </p><p>the chiefs and indunas must now be inclined </p><p>to sober reflections. But, once blood was </p><p>shed, the lust of battle would possess them. </p><p>C)ur only chance was to strike when their </p><p>minds were perplexed and undecided. </p><p>CHAPTER XXXII </p><p>I DELIVER LARUTA’S WORD </p><p>ARCOLL did all the arranging. He </p><p>had a message sent to the chiefs, </p><p>inviting them to an indaba, and presently </p><p>word was brought back that an indaba. </p><p>was called for the next day at noon. That </p><p>same night we heard that Umbooni and </p><p>about twenty of his men had managed to </p><p>evade our ring of scouts and get dean away </p><p>to the south. This was all to our advan- </p><p>tage, as it removed from the coming indaba </p><p>the most irreconcilable of the chiefs. </p><p> That indaba was a queer business. A rcoll</p><p>and I left our escort at the foot of a ravine </p><p>and entered the kraal by the same road as </p><p>I had left it. It was a very bright, hot </p><p>Winter’s day and, try as I might, I could not </p><p>bring myself to think of any danger, I be- </p><p>lieve that in this way most temerarious </p><p>deeds are done—the doer has become insen- </p><p>sible to danger and his imagination is </p><p>clouded with some engrossing purpose. The </p><p>first sentries received us gloomily enough, </p><p>and closed behind us as they had done when </p><p>Machudi’s men haled me thither. Then the </p><p>job became eerie, for we had to walk across </p><p>a green flat with thousands of eyes watching </p><p>us. By-and-by we came to the merula tree </p><p>opposite the kyas, and there we found a ring </p><p>of chiefs, sitting with cocked rifles on their </p><p>knees. </p><p> We were armed with pistols, and the first</p><p>thing Arcoll did was to hand them to one of </p><p>the chiefs. </p><p> “We come in peace,” he said. “We give</p><p>you our lives.” </p><p>THEN the indaba began, Arcoll </p><p>leading off. It was a fine speech he </p><p>made, the finest I have ever listened </p><p>to. He asked them what their grievances </p><p>were; he told them how mighty was the </p><p>power of the white man; he promised that </p><p>what was unjust should be remedied, if only </p><p>they would speak honestly and peacefully; </p><p>312 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>he harped on their old legends and songs,</p><p>claiming for the King of Britain the right of </p><p>their old monarchs. It was a fine speech, </p><p>and yet I saw that it did not convince them. </p><p>They listened moodily, if courteously, and </p><p>at the end there was a blank silence. </p><p> Arcoll turned to me. “For God’s sake,</p><p>Davie,” he said, “talk to them about La- </p><p>puta I It’s our only chance!” </p><p> I had never tried speaking before, and,</p><p>though I talked their tongue, I had not </p><p>Arcoll’s gift of it. But I felt that a great </p><p>cause was at stake and I spoke up as best </p><p>I could. </p><p> I began by saying that Inkulu had been</p><p>my friend, and that at Umvelos’ before the </p><p>Rising he had tried to save my life. At the </p><p>mention of the name I saw eyes brighten. </p><p>At last the audience was hanging on my </p><p>words. </p><p> I told them of Henriques and his treach-</p><p>ery. I told them frankly and fairly of the </p><p>doings at Dupree’s Drift. I made no secret </p><p>of the parti played. “I was fighting for </p><p>my life,” I said. “Any man of you, who is </p><p>a man, would have done the like!” </p><p> Then I told them of my last ride, and the</p><p>sight I saw at the foot of the Rooirand. </p><p>I drew a picture of Henriques lying dead </p><p>with a broken neck, and the Inkulu, </p><p>wounded to death, creeping into the cave. </p><p> In moments of extremity I suppose every</p><p>man becomes an orator. In that hour and </p><p>place I discovered gifts I had never dreamed </p><p>of. Arcoll told me afterwards that I had </p><p>spoken like a man inspired and by a fortu- </p><p>nate chance had hit upon the only way to </p><p>move my hearers. I told of that last scene </p><p>in the cave, when Laputa had broken down </p><p>the bridge and had spoken his dying words </p><p>—that he was the last king in Africa and </p><p>that without him the Rising was at an end. </p><p>Then I told of his leap into the river, and </p><p>a great sigh went up from the ranks about </p><p>me. </p><p> “You see me here,” 1 said, “by the grace</p><p>of God. I found a way up the fall and the </p><p>cliffs which no man has ever traveled before </p><p>or will travel again. Your king is dead. </p><p>He was a great king, as I who stand here </p><p>bear witness, and you will never more see </p><p>his like. His last words were that the </p><p>Rising was over. Respect that_ word, my </p><p>brothers! We come to you not in war. but </p><p>in peace, to offer a free pardon and the re- </p><p>dress of your wrongs. If you fight, you </p><p>fight with the certainty of failure and </p><p>against the wish of the Heir of John. I </p><p>have come here at the risk of my life to</p><p>tell you his commands. His spirit ap- </p><p>proves my mission. Think well before </p><p>you defy the mandate of the Snake and </p><p>risk the vengeance of the Terrible Ones!” </p><p> After that I knew that we had won. The</p><p>chiefs talked among themselves in low whis- </p><p>pers, casting strange looks at me. Then the </p><p>greatest of them advanced and laid his rifle </p><p>at my feet. </p><p> “We believe the word of a brave man,”</p><p>he said. “We accept the mandate of the </p><p>Snake!” </p><p>ARCOLL now took command. He </p><p>arranged for the disarmament bit by </p><p>bit, companies of men being marched </p><p>off from Inanda’s Kraal to stations on the </p><p>plateau, where their arms were collected by </p><p>our troops, and food provided for them. </p><p>For the full history I refer the reader to Mr. </p><p>Upton’s work. It took many days and </p><p>taxed all our resources, but by the end of </p><p>a week we had the whole of Laputa’s army </p><p>in separate stations, under guard, disarmed </p><p>and awaiting repatriation. </p><p> Then Arcoll went south to the war which</p><p>was to rage around the Swaziland and Zulu- </p><p>land borders for many months, while to </p><p>Aitken and myself was entrusted the task o! </p><p>repatriation. We had inadequate troops at. </p><p>our command, and but for our prestige and </p><p>the weight of Laputa’s dead hand there </p><p>might any moment have been a tragedy. </p><p>The task took months, for many of the </p><p>legions came from the far north, and the job </p><p>of feeding troops on a long journey was diffi- </p><p>cult enough in the Winter s-^»on when the </p><p>energies of the country v. .. occupied with </p><p>the fighting in the south. </p><p> Yet it was an experience for whi'cU I shall</p><p>ever be grateful, for it turned me fr&lt; m a rash </p><p>boy into a serious man. I knew then the </p><p>meaning of the white man’s duty. He has </p><p>to take all risks, recking nothing of his life </p><p>or his fortunes, well content to find his </p><p>reward in the fulfilment of his task. That </p><p>is the difference by tween white and black— </p><p>the gift of respoi	the power of being</p><p>in a little way a Ling; and so long as we </p><p>know this and practise it, we will rule not </p><p>in Africa alone but wherever there are dark </p><p>men who live only for the day and their </p><p>own bellies. </p><p> Moreover the work made me pitiful and</p><p>kindly. I learned much of the untold griev- </p><p>Prester John’ </p><p>313 </p><p>ances of the natives, and saw something of </p><p>their strange, twisted reasoning. Before</p><p>we had got Laputa’s army back to their </p><p>kraals, with food enough to tide them over </p><p>the Spring sowing, Aitken and I had got </p><p>sounder policy in our head than you will find </p><p>in the towns, where men sit in offices, and </p><p>see the world through a mist of papers. </p><p> By this time peace was at hand and</p><p>I went back to Inanda’s Kraal to look for </p><p>Cohn’s grave. It was not a difficult quest, </p><p>for on the sward in front of the merula tree </p><p>they had buried him. I found a mason in </p><p>the Iron Kranz village, and from the excel- </p><p>lent red stone of the neighborhood was </p><p>hewed a square slab with an inscription. </p><p>It ran thus: </p><p> “Here lies buried the dog Colin, who was</p><p>killed in defending D. Crawfurd, his master. </p><p>To him it was mainly due that the Kaffir </p><p>Rising failed.’’ </p><p> I leave those who read my tale to see the</p><p>justice of the words. </p><p>CHAPTER XXXIII </p><p>my uncle’s gift is many times </p><p>MULTIPLIED </p><p>WE GOT at the treasure by blowing </p><p>open the turnstile. It was easy </p><p>enough to trace the spot in the rock </p><p>where it stood, but the most patient search </p><p>did not reveal its secret. Accordingly we </p><p>had recourse to dynamite, and soon laid </p><p>bare the stone steps and ascended to the </p><p>gallery. The Schasm was bridged with </p><p>planks, and Arcoll and I crossed alone. </p><p>The cave was as I had left it. The blood- </p><p>stains on the floor had grown dark with time, </p><p>but the ashes of the sacramental fire were </p><p>still there to remind me of the drama I had </p><p>borne a part in. </p><p> When I looked at the way I had escaped</p><p>my brain grew dizzy at the thought of it. </p><p>I do not think that all the gold on earth </p><p>would have driven me a second time to that </p><p>awful escalade. As for Arcoll he could not </p><p>see its possibility at all. “Only a madman </p><p>could have done it!” he said, blinking his </p><p>eyes at the green linn. "Indeed, Davie, </p><p>I think for about four days you were as mad </p><p>as they make. It was a fortunate thing, for </p><p>your madness saved the country!” </p><p>With some labor we got the treasure down </p><p>to the path, and took it under a strong </p><p>guard to Pietersdorp. The Government </p><p>was busy with the settling up after the war, </p><p>and it took many weeks to have our business </p><p>disposed of. At first things looked bad for </p><p>me. The Attorney-General set up a claim </p><p>to the whole as spoils of war, since he argued </p><p>it was the war-chest of the enemy we had</p><p>conquered. I do not know how the matter </p><p>would have gone on legal grounds, though </p><p>I was advised by my lawyers that this claim </p><p>was a bad one. </p><p> But the part I had played in the whole</p><p>business, more especially in the visit to </p><p>Inanda’s Kraal, had made me a kind of </p><p>popular hero, and the Government thought </p><p>better of their first attitude. Besides, Arcoll </p><p>had great influence, and the whole story of </p><p>my doings, which was told privately by him </p><p>to some of the members of the Government, </p><p>disposed them to be generous. Accord- </p><p>ingly they agreed to treat the contents of </p><p>the cave as ordinary treasure-trove, of </p><p>which by the law one-half went to the dis- </p><p>coverer and one-half to the Crown. </p><p> This was well enough as far as the gold</p><p>was concerned, but another difficulty arose </p><p>about the diamonds. For a large part of </p><p>these had obviously been stolen by laborers </p><p>from the mines, and the mining people laid </p><p>claim to them as stolen goods. I was ad- </p><p>vised not to dispute this claim, and conse- </p><p>quently we had a great sorting-out of the </p><p>stones, in the presence of the experts of the </p><p>different mines. In the end it turned out </p><p>that identification was not an easy matter, </p><p>for the experts quarreled furiously among </p><p>themselves. A compromise was at last </p><p>come to, and a division made, and then the </p><p>diamond companies behaved very hand- </p><p>somely, voting me a substantial sum in </p><p>recognition of my services in recovering </p><p>their property. </p><p> What with this, and with my half-share</p><p>of the gold and my share of the unclaimed </p><p>stones, I found that I had a very consider- </p><p>able fortune. The whole of my stones </p><p>I sold to De Beers, for if I had placed them </p><p>on the open market I should have upset the </p><p>delicate equipose of diamond values. When </p><p>I came finally to cast up my account I found </p><p>that I had secured a fortune of a trifle over </p><p>a quarter of a million pounds. </p><p> So much wealth did not dazzle so much as</p><p>it solemnized me. I had no impulse to </p><p>spend any part of it in a riot of folly. It had </p><p>come to me like fairy gold out of the void; </p><p>314 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>it had been bought with man’s blood, almosl </p><p>with my own. I wanted to get away to </p><p>a quiet place and think, for of late my life </p><p>had been too crowded with drama, and there </p><p>comes a satiety of action as well as of idle- </p><p>ness. Above all things I wanted to get </p><p>home. They gave me a great send-off, and</p><p>sang songs, and good fellows shook my hand </p><p>till it ached. The papers were full of me, </p><p>and the Prime Minister made a speech in </p><p>my honor at a farewell banquet. But I </p><p>could not relish this glory as I ought, for </p><p>1 was like a boy thrown violently out of his </p><p>bearings. </p><p> Not till I was nearing Cape Town in the</p><p>irain did I recover my equanimity. The </p><p>burden of the past seemed to slip from me </p><p>suddenly as on the morning when I had </p><p>climbed the linn. I saw my life all lying </p><p>before me; and already I had won success. </p><p>I thought of my return to my own country, </p><p>my first sight of the gray shores of Fife, my </p><p>visit to Kirkcaple, my meeting with my </p><p>mother. I was a rich man now who could </p><p>choose his career, and my mother need </p><p>never again want for comfort. My money </p><p>seemed pleasant to me, for, if men won it by </p><p>brains or industry, I had won it by sterner </p><p>methods, for I had staked against it my life. </p><p>I sat alone in the railway carriage, and cried </p><p>with pure thankfulness. These were com- </p><p>forting tears, for they brought me back to </p><p>my old commonplace self. </p><p>MY LAST memory of Africa is my </p><p>meeting with Tam Dyke. I caught </p><p>sight of him in the streets of Cape </p><p>Town, and, running after him, clapped him </p><p>on the shoulder. He stared at me as if he </p><p>had seen a ghost. </p><p> ‘‘Is it yourself, Davie?” he cried. “I</p><p>never looked to see you again in this world! </p><p>I do nothing but read about you in the </p><p>papers. What for did ye not send for me? </p><p>Here have I been knocking about inside </p><p>a. ship and you have been getting famous! </p><p>They tell me you’re a millionaire, too.” </p><p> 3 had Tam to dinner at my hotel, and</p><p>later, sitting smoking on the terrace and </p><p>vatching the fiying-ants among the aloes, </p><p>J told him the better part of the story 1 have </p><p>here written down. </p><p> “Man, Davie,” he said at the end, “yeJve</p><p>had a tremendous time! Here are you not </p><p>eighteen months away from home and you’re </p><p>going back with a fortune! What will you </p><p>do with it? ” </p><p> I told him that I proposed, to begin with,</p><p>to finish my education at Edinburgh Col- </p><p>lege. At this he roared with laughter. </p><p> “That’s a dull ending, anyway. It’s me</p><p>that should have the money, for I'm full of </p><p>imagination. You were aye a prosaic body; </p><p>Davie.” </p><p> “Maybe I am,” I said. “But I am very</p><p>sure of one thing: If I hadn’t been a</p><p>prosaic body, I wouldn’t be sitting here </p><p>to-night.” </p><p>TWO years later Aitken found the </p><p>diamond pipe which he had always </p><p>suspected lay in the mountains. </p><p>Some of the stones in the cave, being unlike </p><p>any ordinary African diamonds, confirmed </p><p>his suspicions and sent him on the track. </p><p>A Kaffir tribe to the northeast of the Rooi- </p><p>rand had known of it, but they had n^ver </p><p>worked it, but only collected the overspill. </p><p>The closing down of one of the chief existing </p><p>mines had created a shortage of diamonds in </p><p>the world’s markets, and once again the </p><p>position was the same as when Kimberley </p><p>began. Accordingly ■ he made a great for- </p><p>tune, and to-day the Aitken proprietary </p><p>mine is one of the most famous in the coun- </p><p>try- </p><p> But Aitken did more than mine diamonds,</p><p>for he had not forgotten the lesson we had </p><p>learned together in the work of repatriation. </p><p>He laid down a big fund for the education </p><p>and amelioration of the native races, and the </p><p>first fruit of it was the establishment in </p><p>Blaauwildebeestefontein itself of a great </p><p>native training college. It was no factory </p><p>for making missionaries and black teachers^ </p><p>but an institution for giving the Kaffirs the </p><p>kind of training that fits them to be good </p><p>citizens of the State. There you will find </p><p>ever)’ kind of technical workshop, and the </p><p>finest experimental farms, where the blacks </p><p>are taught modem agriculture. They have </p><p>proved themselves apt pupils, and to-day </p><p>you wall see in the glens of the Berg and in </p><p>the Plains Kaffir tillage as scientific as any </p><p>in Africa. They have created a huge ex- </p><p>port trade in tobacco and fruit; the cotton </p><p>promises well; and there is taJk of a nev. </p><p>fiber which will do wonders. Also along the </p><p>river bottoms the india-rubber business is </p><p>prospering. </p><p> There are playing-fields and baths and</p><p>reading-rooms and libraries just as in a </p><p>school at home. In front of the great hall </p><p>of the college a statue stands, the figure of </p><p>The Chair that Smiled	315</p><p>a black man shading his eyes with his hands </p><p>and looking far over the plains to the Rooi- </p><p>rand. On the pedestal it is lettered </p><p>“Prester John,” but the face is the face of </p><p>Laputa. So the last of the kings of Africa </p><p>does not lack his monument. </p><p> Of this institution Mr. Wardlaw is the</p><p>'head. He writes to me weekly, for I am </p><p>one of the governors, as well as an old </p><p>friend, and from a recent letter I take this</p><p>passage: </p><p>I often cast my mind back to the afternoon when </p><p>you and I sat on the step of the schoolhouse and </p><p>talked of the Kaffirs and our future. I had about </p><p>a dozen pupils then, and now I have nearly three </p><p>thousand, and in place of a tin-roofed shanty and </p><p>a yard I have a whole countryside. You laughed at </p><p>me for my keenness, Davie, but I’ve seen it justified. </p><p>I was never a man of war like you, and so I had to </p><p>bide at home while you and your like were straight- </p><p>ening out the troubles. But when it was all over </p><p>my job began, for I could do what you couldn’t do— </p><p>I was the physician to heal wounds. </p><p> You mind how nervous I was when I heard the</p><p>drums beat. I hear them every evening now, for </p><p>we have made a rule that all the Kaffir farms on the </p><p>Berg sound a kind of curfew. It reminds me of old </p><p>times, and tells me that though it is peace now-a- </p><p>THE </p><p> days we mean to keep all the manhood in them that</p><p> they used to exercise in war.</p><p> It would do your eyes good to see the garden we</p><p> have ma’de out of the Klein Labonga glen. The</p><p> place is one big orchard with evep' kind of tropical</p><p> fruit in it, and the irrigation dam is as full of rainbow</p><p> trout as it will hold. Out at Umvelos’ there is</p><p> a tobacco-factory and all round Sikitola’s we have</p><p> square miles of mealie and cotton fields. The loch</p><p> on the Rooirand is stocked with Lochleven trout, and</p><p> we have made a bridlepath up to it in a gully east of</p><p> the one you climbed.</p><p> You ask about Machudi’s. The last time I was</p><p> there the place was white with sheep, for we have got</p><p> the edge of the plateau grazed down and sheep can</p><p> get the short bite there. We have cleaned up all the</p><p> kraals, and the chiefs are members of our county</p><p> council and are as fond of hearing their own voices</p><p> as an Aberdeen bailie.</p><p> It’s a queer transformation we have wrought and,</p><p> whep I sit and smoke my pipe in the evening and</p><p> look over the plains and then at the big black statue</p><p> you and Aitken set up, I thank the Providence that</p><p> has guided me so far. I hope and trust that in the</p><p> Bible words “the wilderness and the solitary place</p><p> are glad for us.” At any rate, it will not be my</p><p> fault if they don’t “blossom as the rose.” Come</p><p> out and visit us soon, man, and see the work you had</p><p> a hand in starting.</p><p> I am thinking seriously of taking Ward-</p><p> law's advice.</p><p>END </p><p>THE CHAIRTHAT SMILED </p><p>BY EDITH RtCKRRV </p><p> IIS room,” said the housekeeper,</p><p> “is never shown.”</p><p>The tourist whom she had </p><p>been conducting through the </p><p>long upper gallery of Selward House stood</p><p>obstinately in front of the low oaken door </p><p>to which she referred. </p><p> “It is not a private apartment?” he in-</p><p>sinuated. “ I should particularly like to see </p><p>it.” He held out a sovereign as inducement. </p><p>Mrs. Green turned her back upon the </p><p>golden temptation and said haughtily: “It </p><p>is not in my power, sir. The room has not </p><p>been opened since I can remember.” </p><p> She turned to move on, but the visitor</p><p>remained standing with his feet wide apart </p><p>and his hands in his pockets. His boots, </p><p>his clothes and his chin proclaimed him a </p><p>successful American. </p><p> “Indeed?” he said. “That is odd. But</p><p>I suppose there is always a way to do these </p><p>things. Is Sir Charles at home? ” </p><p>316 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> She was obliged, to come back to him:</p><p>“No, sir, he has gone to the meet.” </p><p> “And you are sure you have no key that,</p><p>would unlock the door? ” </p><p> “I know my own keys, sir.”</p><p> He shifted his ground: “Weli, is there no</p><p>other member of the family-?” He </p><p>absently played with several gold coins in </p><p>one palm. </p><p> “There’s only Miss Elizabeth, sir; she’s in</p><p>the garden. But I couldn’t trouble her-” </p><p> The American’s face suddenly twinkled:</p><p>“See here, my good woman, if you’ll kindly </p><p>get the young lady to step up here, I’ll bet </p><p>you fifty dollars—that’s ten pounds—she’ll </p><p>find a way to let me into that room! And </p><p>if she doesn’t, you shall have the fifty any- </p><p>way. So you stand to win in either case.” </p><p>If Mrs. Green thought she was dealing </p><p>with a madman, the two notes that he held </p><p>out to her vouched for a degree of sanity. </p><p>Besides, she reflected, she ran no risk except </p><p>of Miss Elizabeth’s anger. The young lady </p><p>knew no more than herself where the key of </p><p>the room was kept—if indeed it had not </p><p>been lost before any of them was bom. </p><p> She pressed a button in the wall, and to</p><p>the footman who appeared gave the brief </p><p>direction that he should look for Miss </p><p>Elizabeth in the garden and ask her whether </p><p>she would be so kind as to come to the house </p><p>a moment. </p><p> She then conducted the persistent in-</p><p>truder back to the entrance-hall, and with </p><p>him awaited her lady’s pleasure. </p><p> He was especially interested in a full-</p><p>length portrait that hung over the chimney- </p><p>piece. </p><p> “That was the first Sir Charles,” she told</p><p>him, “ who founded the fortune of the family </p><p>and built the house in the days of Queen </p><p>Elizabeth.”, </p><p> “Is it allowable to ask how he obtained</p><p>the money?” asked the American, with a </p><p>curious, dry smile. </p><p> “In the wars againsi Spain,” she an-</p><p>swered curtly. </p><p> “ Indeed? And the present Sir Charles—</p><p>any resemblance? ” </p><p> “Sir Charles is clean-shaven." Only the</p><p>promise of the two five-pound notes kept </p><p>her civil. </p><p> He moved to the next portrait: “And the</p><p>red-haired young lady dipped in pearls is </p><p>the founder’s daughter?” </p><p> “His wife,” began the housekeeper, but</p><p>was interrupted by a fresh voice, asking </p><p>haughtily: “Did you wish to see me?” lie </p><p>turned to face a pretty girl in white linen, </p><p>not so unlike the portrait he had been </p><p>studying. </p><p> “ Miss Sel ward? ” He bowed and handed</p><p>her a card upon which she read the name </p><p>Ramon Stanley, and a New York address. </p><p> “I must plead a desire to see your secret</p><p>chamber—not due, as you might suppose, to </p><p>idle curiosity.” He paused and began </p><p>again, with his curious smile, “What should </p><p>you say if I were to tell you exactly what is, </p><p>in that room?” </p><p>SHE looked at him with some slight </p><p>interest: “Cobwebs, I should say. </p><p>How do you know? I never was ip </p><p>it myself and I don’t know what’s thejg—. ■ </p><p>do you, Green? ” </p><p> “No,madam,” said the housekeeper,f1 but.</p><p>I have heard my grandfather tell as how it </p><p>was haunted. He used to say as your </p><p>grandmother, Lady Maria, was the last as </p><p>ever entered the room. What she saw </p><p>nobody ever knew, but she came out scream; </p><p>ing and was took with convulsions and died </p><p>within the day. It hasn’t been unlocked in </p><p>my time—not to my knowledge.” </p><p> “Do you know whether there is a key?”</p><p>asked Miss Elizabeth, with evident curios- </p><p>ity; and as Mrs. Green shook her head, she </p><p>turned to the stranger: “At least, I should </p><p>be interested to hear you tell what you think </p><p>there is in the room.” </p><p> “ I don’t think,” said he. " I knou.-, almost</p><p>as well as if I’d seen ’em. I may be wrong </p><p>in a few details. There’s a big round table </p><p>covered with gilt and embossed leather, </p><p>supported by three lions of painted leather.” </p><p>“Leather!” exclaimed the girl. </p><p> “And lions!” gasped the housekeeper.</p><p> “ Over this should be hanging seven lamps</p><p>—also of leather—representing the Seven </p><p>Deadly Sins; if they were lighted, the flame </p><p>would come out of the mouth of each-” </p><p> The girl was wide-eyed now and Mrs.</p><p>Green dumb with amazement. </p><p> “On the table,” he pursued calmly, "is a</p><p>big wine flagon built like a Spanish galleon </p><p>of the Armada—also of leather. And a </p><p>dozen—there should be a dozen—tankards </p><p>shaped and painted like grinning faccs. with </p><p>pointed hats for their covers.” </p><p>“ Still of leather? ” asked Miss Sel ward. </p><p>“All of leather,” said he. “And round </p><p>the table are leather chairs, a dozen of them, </p><p>shaped and painted to look like men, so that </p><p>The Chair that Smiled </p><p>317 </p><p>when you sit down you seem to sink into </p><p>the arms of a human being—so I under- </p><p>stand-” </p><p> “Of all the madness!” exclaimed Miss</p><p>Selward. </p><p> “For that reason,” said Mr. Stanley,</p><p>“you can perhaps pardon my eagerness to </p><p>Seam whether I am right. Not that I have </p><p>much doubt myself. But I thought it </p><p>worth a trip across the ocean to make </p><p>sure.” </p><p> “Tell me how you knew,” she com-</p><p>manded. </p><p> He considered a moment: “Therewould</p><p>be no point in my doing that until the case </p><p>is proven. Afterward, I should be bound </p><p>to explain.” He added meditatively: “And </p><p>&lt; ach of the chairs has a ring on the forefinger </p><p>of the left hand; and all the faces have eyes </p><p>1 liat follow you round the room, and one, it </p><p>is said, has a smile that comes and goes-” </p><p>He stopped and added with a change of tone, </p><p>“I’m not making up all this stuff, you </p><p>know.” </p><p> Miss Selward hesitated: “Have you any</p><p>1 theory as to how my grandmother came by </p><p>her death?” </p><p> He answered without hesitation:. “Yes, a</p><p>theory-—which the room itself would prove </p><p>or disprove.” </p><p> Miss Selward made up her mind: “ Green,</p><p>I’m going to have a look for that key in the </p><p>study. I know where father keeps all his </p><p>keys—it can’t do any harm. Do you sup- </p><p>pose it’s labeled ‘Haunted Chamber’?” </p><p> She moved away, followed by the house-</p><p>keeper’s protest—words quickly muffled, </p><p>however, by the arrival of the promised </p><p>notes in her palm. </p><p> Stanley had had time to examine all the</p><p>portraits in the hall before Miss Selward </p><p>came back breathless: “They were all </p><p>labeled but these,” she said. “Father’s </p><p>most methodical. I don’t believe he knows </p><p>what these are himself. They are clumsy </p><p>and old enough—it’s a chance.” </p><p> She ran up the wide oak stairway, quickly</p><p>followed by Stanley; and by the time that </p><p>Mrs. Green had labored up to them in the </p><p>gallery they had already tried and rejected </p><p>half the bunch. </p><p> Suddenly Stanley, who had been wrestling</p><p>with the stiff lock, looked at the girl: “It </p><p>turned!” </p><p> “Open—open!” she cried eagerly.</p><p> Still he hesitated: “Do you know, I don’t</p><p>quite like to; I begin to doubt my own state- </p><p>ments now. I’m afraid I shall be made out </p><p>a liar after all.” </p><p> However, he was perhaps unconsciously</p><p>pushing harder than he realized, for a mere </p><p>touch of her hand above his bent shoulder </p><p>sent the door inward with a crash. </p><p> The room was darkened by a green cur-</p><p>tain bung across a large window opposite the </p><p>door, but this curtain was full of rifts and </p><p>holes that admitted strong rays and patches </p><p>of light. </p><p> Miss Selward, who had leaned eagerly</p><p>forward, fell back with a suppressed scream </p><p>and clutched the housekeeper’s arm. Stan- </p><p>ley himself, looking in, gripped the doorpost </p><p>hard, so strong was the illusion upon him </p><p>that a company of men sat drinking at the </p><p>round table, while over their heads shadowy </p><p>monstrous dragons or crocodiles threatened </p><p>descent upon them. </p><p> The next moment, triumph was upper-</p><p>most. “By George!” said he. “What did </p><p>I tell you?” </p><p> “Mercy on us!” ejaculated the plump</p><p>housekeeper, feeling that the emergency was </p><p>altogether beyond her. “Shall I ring for </p><p>help, madam?” </p><p> “What for?” asked Stanley. “No, we’li</p><p>just wait to get a little five air into the place, </p><p>so that we don’t all die of suffocation; and </p><p>then we’ll look round and see how nearly I </p><p>was right.” </p><p> The air that came out into the draughty</p><p>corridor was peculiarly dead, full of dry rot, </p><p>attesting that the room and its windows had </p><p>been shut for generations. </p><p>STANLEY was the first to enter. </p><p>With a careful avoidance of the </p><p>ghastly seated figures, he crossed to </p><p>the large window and cautiously tugged </p><p>to draw one of the green curtains aside.</p><p>It first resisted, then tore under his </p><p>hand with a great cloud of dust, then gave </p><p>way above so that he had barely time to </p><p>dodge its folds. Half blinded and choked, </p><p>he groped his way back to the gallery, where </p><p>the two women stood coughing, the younger </p><p>with her handkerchief over her mouth. </p><p> “One good thing,” said Stanley, when he</p><p>could speak, “the germs are probably as </p><p>dead as the air. Shall we explore further? ” </p><p>“I’m not sure that we oughtn’t to wait </p><p>until my father returns,” said Miss Selward. </p><p>But curiosity overcame her: “There can be </p><p>no harm in looking.” </p><p> “I want to prove that my list was right,”</p><p>318 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>said Stanley, whose eyes had been busy. </p><p>“Look now, isn’t it so? Here is the leather </p><p>table supported by lions; on it the galleon </p><p>and the twelve leering mugs; above it the </p><p>seven Deadly Sins to give light; and round </p><p>it the twelve chairs like Elizabethan dan- </p><p>dies with frills and slashes. They have even </p><p>the rings that I spoke of on their fore- </p><p>fingers. By George), notice their eyes—they </p><p>look alive! Can you make out which is the </p><p>one that smiles? ” </p><p> He went from one chair to another trying</p><p>to discover minute differences in their </p><p>seeming sameness. Suddenly Miss Selward </p><p>said faintly: “Open—the window—please! ” </p><p>While he struggled with the rusty catch </p><p>he heard a slight thud and turned in time to </p><p>see her sway and fall into the chair at the </p><p>head of the table. </p><p> For a moment he was paralyzed, not at</p><p>the sight of her fair head drooping sideways </p><p>over the leather arm, but at the expression </p><p>of the painted chair-back that looked and </p><p>leered above her shoulder. There could be </p><p>no doubt which chair it was that smiled! </p><p> “For God’s sake,” he cried to the house-</p><p>keeper, as he rushed toward the two </p><p>women, “get her out of that!” </p><p> But Mrs. Green stood like a wooden</p><p>image, and Miss Selward straightened her- </p><p>self with an effort to speak naturally: “I’m </p><p>all right; I was only a little faint. Do you </p><p>know, this ring looks as if it were set with </p><p>real rubies? And it’s loose—I believe it </p><p>would come off-” </p><p> She got no further, for Stanley was bend-</p><p>ing over her, white as chalk. Before she </p><p>could exclaim, he had caught her by the </p><p>arms and dragged her from her place so </p><p>violently that they both nearly fell over. </p><p>To save them, he clutched at the table and</p><p>set all the tankards rattling. The nearest </p><p>one rolled to the floor. From one of the </p><p>dragons above something was jarred loose </p><p>and fell with a snap on the table, but no- </p><p>body looked at it. Both women stared at </p><p>the stranger, who was wiping his forehead, </p><p>with his eyes shut. “By George!” said he. </p><p>“That was a near go!” </p><p> Miss Selward was the first to recover her</p><p>composure. “Now,” she said, “will you </p><p>kindly explain?” </p><p> Stanley opened his eyes with a slight</p><p>start: “It’s all right—only don’t sit down </p><p>again. That was the Queen’s chair. You </p><p>mustn’t sit in the Queen’s chair.” </p><p> “What queen?” said she..</p><p> “ Elizabeth. That’s the chair that smiled.</p><p>No mistake about it. I saw it plain as day.” </p><p>Miss Selward looked back at it. “It isn’t </p><p>smiling now,” she said gravely. “You must </p><p>have imagined. In fact, I’m not sure now </p><p>which of these two I sat in. But I can soon </p><p>tell; it was the one on which the ring was </p><p>loose.” </p><p> She turned to see, but Stanley caught her</p><p>arm without ceremony: “Don’t! Wait till </p><p>I tell you something.” </p><p> Her attention was diverted by a clatter of</p><p>hoofs in the court below the open window. </p><p>“That will be my father,” she said, and </p><p>then: “ Green, will you go down and ask Sir </p><p>Charles to step up here at once? And not </p><p>a word to the servants, please.” </p><p> The wooden image came to life with a</p><p>gasp of relief and waited for no second telling. </p><p>“Now,” said Miss Selward. </p><p> “ Perhaps you did not notice,” said Stan-</p><p>ley, “that my Christian name is Ramon?” </p><p>She nodded. “Spanish,” she said. “1 </p><p>wondered a little.” </p><p> “I am of Spanish descent,” said he, and</p><p>in that moment she saw his race in the </p><p>quality of his bearing. “But my people </p><p>have been settled in America for genera- </p><p>tions. You have no idea how this furniture </p><p>came to be here? No? Well, I have the </p><p>story of it in a small tin box full of parch- </p><p>ments—three hundred years old and more. </p><p>The family didn’t know what was in them— </p><p>we’ve always been country gentlemen, not </p><p>scholars; but when I went home from Johns </p><p>Hopkins I stumbled upon the box in my </p><p>father’s safe and tried to figure out the </p><p>contents. They were written partly in </p><p>Spanish and partly in Latin, but I couldn’t </p><p>make much of ’em, so I got the bright idea </p><p>of bringing ’em over to an expert at the </p><p>British Museum. Now I have neat copies</p><p>in duplicate, one of which I shall be happy </p><p>to lend your father some day—if he is </p><p>interested. Among the papers was a plan </p><p>of this house as built by the first Sir Charles, </p><p>and an inventory of the contents of this </p><p>room. Hence my visit to-day. ” </p><p> “But how in the world-?”</p><p> “It’s easy when you know. Your an-</p><p>cestor happened to be an ardent admirer of </p><p>Queen Elizabeth; mine, the first Raymond </p><p>Stanley—he was an Irishman in the service </p><p>of King Philip of Spain—happened to be one </p><p>of the countless victims of Mary Stuart.” </p><p>“ It sounds like a fairy-tale! ” she breathed </p><p>with parted lips. </p><p>The Chair that Smiled </p><p>319 </p><p> "IT'S plain history,” said he, ‘the</p><p>kind of fact that’s stranger than fic- </p><p>tion. Just listen to this. When poor </p><p>old Philip found his Armada show was no </p><p>good, he was pretty near broken-hearted; and </p><p>that was the time Raymond Stanley went to </p><p>him with a neat scheme for revenge on his </p><p>old enemy Elizabeth—a little gift of furni- </p><p>ture for her palace of Hampton Court, or </p><p>Staines, or where you like. He had hap- </p><p>pened to come upon a leather-worker—of </p><p>Cordova, I think it was—and between them </p><p>they devised this pretty suite for the Queen </p><p>and her maids of honor. There’s a little </p><p>delicate irony in the design, do you see?—a </p><p>hint at the taste of the Virgin Queen and her </p><p>ladies for the knees of courtiers, in the light </p><p>of the Seven Deadly Sins—that’s pretty </p><p>ucar a brilliant idea, isn’t it? Not to speak </p><p>of.serving the wine in a Spanish galleon. </p><p> “I don’t know whether the plan was to</p><p>drug the drink—plenty of dare-devils about, </p><p>seminary priests and others, who would </p><p>have undertaken it for a handful of silver. </p><p>I could tell you the names of some of them— </p><p>Ejiglish and Irish soldiers of fortune, Harry </p><p>Young and Hugh Cahill, Moody, Walpole, </p><p>Edmund Yorke1—a dozen or more, generally </p><p>of Sir William Stanley’s regiment. Sir </p><p>William was Raymond’s uncle—but never </p><p>mind all that; you shall read it later. This </p><p>splendid gift was shipped for England-under </p><p>Captain Middleton, I believe; and Raymond </p><p>Stanley and some of the others went with it. </p><p>Off Ushant they encountered an English </p><p>man-of-war, commanded by one Captain </p><p>Charles Selward-” </p><p> “Ah!’’said the girl. “Now I beginto---”</p><p> “They fought—naturally. Selward was</p><p>the better seaman—the Maria Reina was </p><p>pillaged and sunk—most of the crew</p><p>drowned. Middleton and Raymond Stan- </p><p>ley were picked up by French fishermen. </p><p>Afterward Stanley came to England in </p><p>disguise and by his own account haunted </p><p>Selward House awhile, trying to get pos- </p><p>session of his stuff or to take revenge on the </p><p>English captain, whom he terms ‘that in- </p><p>sufferable pirate and enemy of God.’ He </p><p>failed. In fact, in our old papers—written </p><p>for his son with the express command that </p><p>that young man should follow up the feud as </p><p>he saw his chance—he says that Selward, </p><p>with the aid of the devil, saw through the </p><p>plan and betrayed it to the Queen, who </p><p>thereupon was so - mewed up in her chamber’ </p><p>that no stranger could come into her pres- </p><p>ence. When he found that the Queen had </p><p>not only knighted Sir Charles but had be- </p><p>stowed the furniture upon him for his pains, </p><p>he lost heart, and went back to Spain. </p><p>His son may have been a lazy rascal or a </p><p>pious chap—anyway, nothing happened </p><p>except that the papers and the name Ray- </p><p>mond in its Spanish form have been handed </p><p>down until now.” </p><p> “But why did he want the Queen to have</p><p>the furniture? And why were you so </p><p>alarmed when I sat in that chair?” asked </p><p>the practical Miss Selward. </p><p> “That’s the cream of the plot,” said</p><p>Stanley, but was interrupted by the sound </p><p>of heavy footsteps in the corridor. He </p><p>turned to confront a short, stout man in </p><p>mud-splashed hunting pink, whom he </p><p>rightly assumed to be Sir Charles. </p><p> “Hoity-toity!” said this individual, after</p><p>a hasty glance about the room. “What’s all </p><p>the row? ” </p><p> Stanley’s answer was to seize his gray felt</p><p>hat and drop it on the floor. Then, seem- </p><p>ingly oblivious of father and daughter, he </p><p>knelt and fumbled for some seconds, rising </p><p>rather flushed but calm. “I have just </p><p>caught a mouse,” he observed amiably, and </p><p>showed a beady-eyed, gray snout wriggling </p><p>between his thumb and forefinger. “ It was </p><p>a lucky chance I happened to see it. If you </p><p>don’t object, we will try an experiment </p><p>before I explain myself.” </p><p> He went up to the chair from which Miss</p><p>Selward, when she had fallen into it, had </p><p>brushed away some of the dust. </p><p>“If you will kindly stand by the table, </p><p>you will be able to tell me whether my im- </p><p>pression of a smile was a delusion or not.’1 </p><p>He sat down deliberately and leaned back. </p><p>Miss Selward half put out her hand: “But </p><p>don’t—isn’t it—dangerous?” she gasped.</p><p> The huntsman was speechless, seemingly</p><p>on the verge of apoplexy at these strange </p><p>doings in his house. </p><p> “I know the risk,” said Stanley calmiy.</p><p>“Watch me.. You observed that the ring </p><p>was loose and were on the point of playing </p><p>with it when I grabbed you. A loose ring is </p><p>a great temptation for idle fingers—espe- </p><p>cially a beautiful ring set with rubies. </p><p>Watch my hand.” He leaned away from </p><p>the chair-back as the girl had done, and, </p><p>holding the squeaking mouse firmly between </p><p>his thumb and first two fingers, set it upon </p><p>the ring, using it as a sort of pad, and pro- </p><p>ceeded to twirl this round and round. </p><p>320 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Miss Selward dung to her father’s arm,</p><p>lather faint. </p><p> In two or three seconds Stanley held out</p><p>liis palm toward them, with the mouse upon </p><p>it, limp and dead! </p><p> Miss Selward was fast losing her self-</p><p>control. “Father, father!” she sobbed </p><p>hysterically. “He saved my life! I was </p><p>going to play with the ring!” </p><p> “- -!” said Sir Charles, and</p><p>nothing more. </p><p>“IT’S this way,” said Stanley. </p><p>“Each ruby is set in a circle of tiny </p><p>stilettos—tipped with poison. I </p><p>wasn’t at all sure it would have kept its </p><p>strength so long, but I thought best to be </p><p>on the safe side. Old Raymond saicl it </p><p>would kill a cat in ten minutes and a </p><p>human being in several hours. All the </p><p>other rings are of painted leather; this is </p><p>of real gold and rubies, as you see. This </p><p>fact was to be pointed out to the Queen, </p><p>and the hope was that, with her love of </p><p>priceless toys, she would sit down and </p><p>grab it before she thought of a possible </p><p>trap.” </p><p> “Let us get away from this horrible</p><p>room!” sobbed the girl. </p><p> “--!” said the huntsman. “I</p><p>think it’s time!” </p><p> “But, say,” asked Stanley, rising from</p><p>his chair, “did either of you notice the </p><p>smile? ” </p><p> It seemed they had, not unnaturally, been</p><p>absorbed in watching the mouse. </p><p> “Well, I guess we aren’t in a state to</p><p>experiment any more to-day. But I like to </p><p>fancy that old Raymond planned the grin </p><p>for the spectators after her Majesty had </p><p>toyed with the ring long enough. We can </p><p>look into that another day; there may be</p><p>a spring that releases a smile upon the </p><p>leather.” </p><p> He perceived that the old gentleman, with</p><p>his daughter on his arm, had halted ma- </p><p>jestically by the door and was adjusting a </p><p>monocle, surveying the stranger as if he had </p><p>that very moment first discerned his pres- </p><p>ence. </p><p> “And what am I to do for you, young</p><p>sir? ” he demanded. </p><p> In an instant there was a curious atmos-</p><p>pheric change. From the eyes of Ramon </p><p>flashed the wild spirit of his Irish-Spanish </p><p>ancestor encountering the choleric face of </p><p>Elizabeth’s old sea-dog; then the Twentieth </p><p>Century returned, and the young American </p><p>laughed: “Why, I guess you can sell me </p><p>this lumber-room stuff—that’s all. I’ve </p><p>taken a fancy to it and I’ll give you a good </p><p>figure-” </p><p> “Sir,” interrupted the enraged British</p><p>householder, “I’ll do nothing of the </p><p>sort!” </p><p> “Oh, yes, I guess you will,” said Stanley</p><p>easily. “We don’t want to rake up an old </p><p>quarrel, but I’ve got about as good a claim </p><p>to it as you have. I might get the British </p><p>law to work op lost property—or treasure- </p><p>trove, or some such thing. I can prove it </p><p>belonged to us all right.” </p><p> “I think,” said Sir Charles, swallowing</p><p>his indignation in an access of dignity, “ that </p><p>it is high time to prove something!” </p><p> “Quite right, papa,” said Miss Selward,</p><p>now recovered sufficiently to be her own </p><p>mistress. “You shall have the whole story </p><p>of how we came to break into the Bluebeard </p><p>Chamber. But first you are going to ask </p><p>Mr. Stanley to tea and let him wash and </p><p>brush off the dust of centuries, and then we </p><p>can have explanations by the drawing-room </p><p>fire-” </p><p> “I will not sell him anything,” growled</p><p>the British father, marching ahead. </p><p> Miss Selward flung a look at Stanley that</p><p>said quite plainly, “We shall bring him to </p><p>time”; and to the hunched shoulders of the </p><p>pink coat she remarked: “You seem to have </p><p>forgotten how nearly your daughter shared </p><p>the fate of the mouse. I should think you’d </p><p>be glad to get rid of the chair that smiled: </p><p>anyway-” </p><p> “-the-” was the growl that en-</p><p>sued. </p><p> But Miss Selward held out her hand to</p><p>Stanley as a peace-offering. “ I think we’d </p><p>better bury the hatchet,” said she. “ Prob- </p><p>ably the ownership of the furniture will</p><p>adjust itself in time.” </p><p>IT WAS not a matter of great </p><p>surprise in England and America </p><p>when such an adjustment shortly </p><p>after took place. </p><p> The bride insisted that the leather furni-</p><p>ture be kept in seclusion, and the ruby ring </p><p>thickly swathed in bandages and shown with </p><p>great care. But whether the chair smiled in </p><p>reality or in imagination is a point upon </p><p>which there is dispute to the present day. </p><p>Some people see it and some don’t—that </p><p>is all. </p><p>LOOKING </p><p>BEING SOME REAL STORIES FROM </p><p>THE LIFE of a MASTER ADVENTURER </p><p>BY CAPTAIN GEORGE BBOYNTOH </p><p>ERAZIL </p><p>A BOUQUET OF REVOLUTIONS </p><p>ITHOUT knowing where or how </p><p>the cruise would end, but confi- </p><p>dent it would lead to trouble— </p><p>though I did not imagine how </p><p>much of it there really would be or how un- </p><p>pleasant it would prove—I bought the </p><p>Alice Ada, a brigantine of three hundred </p><p>tons, and got a general cargo for Rosario, </p><p>Brazil, on the River Parava.

Before his weakness had become </p><p>apparent he was made constitutional Presi- </p><p>dent, and Floriano Peixotto was elected </p><p>Vice-President. Deodoro’s policy was weak </p><p>and vacillating and his popularity waned </p><p>rapidly. A revolution had been quietly </p><p>fomented by Floriano, the Vice-President. </p><p>He soon had the army at his back and</p><p>gained the support of Admiral Mello, </p><p>ranking officer of the Brazilian navy, and </p><p>Admiral Soldanlia da Gama, commandant </p><p>of the naval academy. They brought mat- </p><p>ters to a head on the morning of November </p><p>23, 1891. Mello took up a position at the </p><p>foot of the main street of Rio is the cruiser </p><p>322 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Riachuelo, the finest ship in the navy, </p><p>trained his guns on the Palace of Itumary </p><p>and sent word to Deodoro that he would </p><p>open fire on him in two hours if he did not </p><p>abdicate in favor of Floriano. Deodoro </p><p>abdicated in two minutes, dropping dead </p><p>soon afterward from heart disease, and </p><p>Floriano was proclaimed President. </p><p> Before he had time to get his new chair</p><p>well warmed he had a row with Mello, who </p><p>considered that he was rightfully entitled to </p><p>be the power behind the throne. Floriano </p><p>made it plain to him that, while Mello might </p><p>give friendly advice, he could not go an inch </p><p>beyond that. Floriano was perhaps one </p><p>half Indian and the rest corrupted Portu- </p><p>guese; sixty years old, with dear, brown </p><p>eyes and iron-gray hair and whiskers—a </p><p>strong, fine character, perfectly fearless, </p><p>absolutely honest and devoted to his coun- </p><p>try, whose interests he greatly advanced. </p><p>He was proud of his Indian blood, which he </p><p>made a synonym for courage and fairness, </p><p>and often referred to it. He was the best </p><p>president I have ever known, not excepting </p><p>even the great Guzman. </p><p> Mello was a younger man and more of</p><p>a Spaniard in his blood and his characteris- </p><p>tics. He had considerable bravery, of the </p><p>kind that is best displayed in the presence </p><p>of a large audience, but he was impetuous </p><p>and at times foolish. At that, he was more </p><p>a man after my own heart, for he stood for </p><p>revolt and anarchy, while Floriano stood for </p><p>law and order. Soldanha da Gama, the </p><p>third figure in the drama, was a strange </p><p>mixture of naval ability, cowardice and </p><p>theatrical warrior. </p><p> Mello worked chiefly among naval officers,</p><p>aristocrats, adherents of Dom Pedro and </p><p>the Catholic clergy, and in the end they all </p><p>became his allies. He was unable to shake </p><p>the army, and the influence of the priests </p><p>was minimized by the fact that the people </p><p>generally were blindly in love with the new </p><p>scheme of self-government, and were loyal </p><p>to Floriano. </p><p> As Mello's plot shaped up I began to sus-</p><p>pect that his real purpose was to restore</p><p>Dom Pedro to the throne and make himself </p><p>the power behind it. Mello cared nothing </p><p>for titles; it was his ambition to be the dic- </p><p>tator of Brazil. Later events led me to </p><p>believe that he had an understanding with </p><p>several European rulers who were keenly </p><p>anxious to see the “divine right of kings” </p><p>perpetuated in South America. Dom Pedro </p><p>had issued a protest against his deposi- </p><p>tion as soon as he reached Europe, in which </p><p>all the princes of the house of Coburg </p><p>joined, and was conducting an active cam- </p><p>paign for his restoration. </p><p>*1 IT WAS amusing to watch the de- </p><p>g velopment of Mello’s rebellion. </p><p>One would have thought two friendly </p><p>leaders were planning rival surprise parties, </p><p>in which there was to be nothing more seri- </p><p>ous than the throwing of confetti. Flo- </p><p>riano, surrounded by spies and assassins, but </p><p>also by many loyal and devoted friends, </p><p>knew perfectly well, from his own spies, </p><p>what Mello was doing, but, relying on his </p><p>own strength and the public sentiment be- </p><p>hind him, he made no move to check him, </p><p>Mello was well aware that Floriano knew </p><p>all that was going on, yet neither one gave </p><p>any outward sign of this knowledge and </p><p>when they were together they appeared to </p><p>be friends. </p><p> It was along in July or August, 1893, that</p><p>Mello sent for me and expressed a wish that </p><p>I go down to Santa Catarina Island, off the </p><p>southern coast of Brazil, and blow up the </p><p>Refmblica, the one Brazilian warship whose </p><p>officers had so far remained loyal to Floriano, </p><p>though finally, just before the revolution </p><p>was declared, they went over to Mello. </p><p>With the exception of Soldanha da Gama, </p><p>who was neutral, but whom he regarded as </p><p>more of a friend than an enemy, Mello had </p><p>converted the rest of the navy to his cause. </p><p>He offered a cash payment and a commission </p><p>in the navy in return for her destruction, but </p><p>I could never get him down to definite </p><p>terms. </p><p> While we were still negotiating 1 received</p><p>a call from one of Floriano’s aides, who </p><p>asked me to accompany him to the palace. </p><p>He took me in the rear entrance and up </p><p>a back stairway to Floriano’s private sala </p><p>where, after presenting me, he left me, as I </p><p>supposed, alone with the President. </p><p> “I understand,” said Floriano, “that you</p><p>were in Venezula with President Guzman </p><p>and have had military training and experi- </p><p>ence. </p><p> “That is correct, sir.”</p><p> “I am told, too, that you have made</p><p>a study of high explosives and have in- </p><p>vented a remarkable torpedo.” </p><p> “That is also true.”</p><p> “Would you be willing to undertake</p><p>a mission that would involve considerable </p><p>Looking for Trouble </p><p>323 </p><p>danger, but for which you would be well </p><p>paid?” </p><p> “I am open to anything except vulgar</p><p>assassination. That is my business.” </p><p>“What do you charge for your services?” </p><p>“That depends entirely on the nature of </p><p>the work.” </p><p> “Then we can leave that question open</p><p>until the nature of the work has been de- </p><p>cided on, provided it is understood that your </p><p>compensation will be such as you are ordi- </p><p>narily accustomed to.” </p><p> “Very good, sir.”</p><p> “Brazil may need your services, Colonel</p><p>Boynton.” </p><p> “I beg your pardon,” I interrupted.</p><p>•' Captain Boynton.” </p><p> “I repeat, Colonel Boynton,” he replied,</p><p>with a smile and the suggestion of a bow. </p><p>“ Brazil may need your services, but I can </p><p>not tell how soon nor in what capacity.” </p><p>“If I enter your service it will be a loyal </p><p>service to the end,” I told him. </p><p> “ Consider yourself, then, in the service</p><p>of Brazil.” As he said this he raised his </p><p>hand and from behind a curtain appeared </p><p>Captain Cochrane, a descendant of the </p><p>English Admiral Cochrane, who had fought </p><p>for Brazil seventy years before. </p><p> “As we were strangers I took this precau-</p><p>tion,” explained Floriano. “It will not be </p><p>necessary again.” </p><p> “It was perfectly justifiable,” I replied.</p><p>Captain Cochrane then repeated in </p><p>English my conversation with the President </p><p>to be sure I understood it. Immediately on </p><p>my arrival at my hotel I sent word to Mello </p><p>that I would consider no further proposition </p><p>from him. </p><p>MELLO’S REBELLION BREAKS OUT </p><p>A FEW days later the revolution was de- </p><p>clared, under conditions such as one </p><p>would look for on the light-opera stage but </p><p>never in real life, not even in South America. </p><p>On the evening of September 5th Floriano </p><p>went to the opera, accompanied by Mello, </p><p>Soldanha and several other officers of ihe </p><p>army and navy, and they all sat together in </p><p>the Presidential box. Mello and Soldanha </p><p>excused themselves after the second act.</p><p>They left their cloaks in the box and said </p><p>they would be back in a few minutes. </p><p>Knowing full well the reason for their de- </p><p>parture, Floriano bowed them out with an </p><p>ironical excess of politeness. Soldanhs, </p><p>who had not yet taken sides, though his </p><p>sympathies belonged to the “rebellion,” </p><p>with which he subsequently allied himself, </p><p>retired to the Naval School, on an island </p><p>near the city, and Mello went on board his </p><p>flagship, the Aquidaban. </p><p> During the night he assembled his cap-</p><p>tains and impressively gave them their final </p><p>orders, with the dramatic announcement </p><p>that the standard of revolt would be hoisted </p><p>at sunrise. His fleet, in addition to the </p><p>flagship, consisted of the Guanabara, Tra- </p><p>jano and Almirante Tamandale, protected </p><p>cruisers; the Siete de Selcmbro, a wooden </p><p>barbette ship; the gunboat Centaur and two </p><p>river monitors. The protected cruiser Re- </p><p>publica, whose officers had just decided to </p><p>join with the rest, was coming up from down </p><p>the coast, and the Riachuelo, with which </p><p>Mello had forced the abdication of Deodoro, </p><p>was cruising in the Mediterranean. It was </p><p>not an imposing force, but it was sufficient </p><p>to give Mello command of the sea, while </p><p>Floriano was in control of the forts and the </p><p>land forces. </p><p> At daybreak Mello seized all of the Gov-</p><p>ernment shipping in the bay and announced </p><p>a blockade of Rio harbor. He then sent </p><p>word to Floriano that if he did not abdicate, </p><p>without naming his successor, by four </p><p>o’clock that afternoon, he would bombard </p><p>the city. This threat was also communi- </p><p>cated to the foreign ministers, evidently </p><p>in the hope that they would try to </p><p>persuade Floriano to step out, in the </p><p>interests of peace, but they promptly pro- </p><p>tested to Mello against any bombardment. </p><p>Under any circumstances, they told hims </p><p>unless he proposed to violate the interna- </p><p>tional rules of warfare, he could not bom- </p><p>bard until after formal notice of forty-eight </p><p>hours, to allow the removal of neutrals and </p><p>non-combatants. </p><p> Floriano’s reply was an emphatic refusal</p><p>to abdicate, and, precisely at four o’clock </p><p>Mello answered it with one shell from a 3- </p><p>inch gun, which exploded near the American </p><p>Consulate and killed a foreigner. During </p><p>the next week Mello fired forty or fifty shots </p><p>into the city every day, but they did little </p><p>damage. The fact that they apparently </p><p>were not aimed at any particular -spot </p><p>probably made no difference in the execu-</p><p>tion. Frequently he would send boats </p><p>ashore for supplies, to which nobody paid </p><p>any attention, and at four o’clock every </p><p>afternoon the Aquidaban would steam </p><p>324 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>solemnly'over and engage in a comic-opera </p><p>duel with Fort Santa Cruz, which was </p><p>located at the point of the harbor entrance </p><p>opposite Sugar Loaf Hill. </p><p> Hello’s shots invariably went clear over</p><p>the fort, or buried themselves in its walls, </p><p>while the gunners at the fort could not have </p><p>hit him if he had stood still for an hour, so </p><p>no damage was done to either side. After </p><p>about twenty shots the Aquidaban would </p><p>return to her anchorage, slowly and with </p><p>great dignity, and hostilities would be over </p><p>until the next day at the same hour. This </p><p>daily duel, which was the star act in the </p><p>serio-comic program, always drew a crowd </p><p>to the water-front. Business went on as </p><p>usual throughout the “revolution,” which </p><p>was regarded with amused interest rather </p><p>than with fear. </p><p>VERY soon after the firing of the </p><p>■	- I first shot, Italian, English, German,</p><p>Austrian and Portuguese warships </p><p>appeared at Rio, ostensibly to protect the </p><p>rights of their citizens, but their prompt </p><p>arrival, made possible only by the fact that </p><p>they were cruising close at hand, which was </p><p>in itself significant, and the attitude they </p><p>assumed, made it plain to me that they were </p><p>there under secret orders to aid in the res- </p><p>toration of Dom Pedro. Mello was not </p><p>a rebel, but a pirate, yet the commanders of </p><p>these foreign ships, all representing mon- </p><p>archies, gave him their moral support, and, I </p><p>have always believed, that only the belated </p><p>arrival of an American naval force pre- </p><p>vented them from giving him their active </p><p>support as well. </p><p> Their influence was so strong that when</p><p>Rear Admiral Oscar F. Stanton, of the </p><p>United States Navy, finally reached Rio he </p><p>made the mistake of saluting Mello. For </p><p>this he was speedily recalled, Rear Admiral </p><p>Gherardi being sent down to succeed him. </p><p>Stanton’s excuse was that he wished to </p><p>maintain a neutral position, but no question </p><p>of neutrality was involved. I know that </p><p>several of the American naval officers who </p><p>arrived later shared my view that Mello was </p><p>a pirate and should have been blown out of </p><p>the water by the combined fleets. It was </p><p>evident, from the prompt recall of Stanton, </p><p>that the Navy Department at Washington</p><p>held the same opinion, but had not sufficient </p><p>courage in its convictions to order the sup- </p><p>pression of Mello. The ranking officer of </p><p>the combined fleets was the Italian Vice- </p><p>Admiral, Magnani. The senior British </p><p>officer present was Captain Lang, of the </p><p>Sirius. Until the arrival of an officer of </p><p>flag rank, Captain Henry F. Picking, of the </p><p>Charleston, was the senior officer present of </p><p>the American navy, and next to him was </p><p>Captain (now Rear Admiral, retired) Silas </p><p>W. Terry, on the Newark. </p><p>A TORPEDO ENTERPRISE </p><p> A BOUT a week after the firing of the first</p><p>shot I was on my way to the water- </p><p>front to witness the regular afternoon duel </p><p>between the Aquidaban and Fort Santa </p><p>Cruz, when I was overtaken by a Govern- </p><p>ment carriage, and Colonel Pimental, whom </p><p>I knew well, asked me to get in with him, as </p><p>he had orders for me from Floriano. He </p><p>drove along the shore of the bay to a new </p><p>galvanized building at a point some distance </p><p>beyond the island of .the Naval School and </p><p>near the railway machine-shops. On the </p><p>way he explained that this building had been </p><p>erected for my use and in it I was to con- </p><p>struct, as rapidly as possible, a large torpedo </p><p>with which to destroy the Aquidaban. </p><p> I was to have whatever I called for, but</p><p>from the time the work was begun on the </p><p>torpedo until it was finished I was to allow </p><p>no one to enter or leave the building, for fear </p><p>that word of what was being done would gel </p><p>to Mello’s spies. ’ The structure was of ample </p><p>size and had comfortable living accommo- </p><p>dations for ten men, which was as many </p><p>as I could use. I took up my quarters in the </p><p>building at once and, after drawing on the </p><p>master mechanic of the railroad for a lot of </p><p>copper plates and such other supplies as I </p><p>would need, got right to work. </p><p> Late that evening I heard the rumble of</p><p>a carriage outside and a moment later in </p><p>walked Floriano, an old gray shawl around </p><p>his shoulders, with the Secretary of the </p><p>Treasury, the Secretary of Marine and a </p><p>Senator. Floriano inquired first as to my </p><p>comfort and I assured him I was entirely </p><p>satisfied. Then he said: “I am relying on </p><p>you, Colonel Boynton, to save Brazil from </p><p>further trouble by destroying the Aquidaban. </p><p>You will have to make and use your torpedo, </p><p>with such help as we can give you. Now </p><p>that you know what you are to do, what is </p><p>your price?” </p><p> I told him I would expect to be paid the</p><p>appraised value of the ship if I sank her or</p><p>put her out of commission. After consulting </p><p>m </p><p>Looking for Trouble </p><p>325 </p><p>with the others Floriano agreed. We fixed </p><p>the value of the ship at $600,000 gold, and </p><p>a contract along these lines was drawn up </p><p>and signed the next day. </p><p> The torpedo I built for this business was</p><p>the largest I had ever made. It was twelve </p><p>feet long, four feet in diameter in the middle </p><p>and carried more than five hundred pounds </p><p>of dynamite, for I wanted to be certain that </p><p>the ship would be at least disabled by </p><p>her contact with it. It floated just below </p><p>the ■ surface of the water. Floriano came </p><p>down to witness the final test, and handed </p><p>me a commission as Colonel in the Bra- </p><p>zilian army. He approved the plan of </p><p>campaign which I had mapped out and said </p><p>the necessary orders would be issued at </p><p>once. </p><p> "I believe you will succeed,” were his</p><p>parting words. “ I hope you vail come back </p><p>as General Boynton! ” </p><p>WH7.LE Mello had seized all of the </p><p>Government vessels in the harbor, </p><p>there were a few tugs left, which, to </p><p>prevent his interference, were flying the </p><p>British flag, on the pretense that they were </p><p>owned by Englishmen, I was to be given </p><p>one of these tugs, and my plan was to steal </p><p>around into Nictheroy Bay at night and </p><p>anchor close under the hill at the end of the </p><p>peninsula, where I would be hidden from the </p><p>rebel fleet. In the morning I would load the </p><p>torpedo and wait for the daily exchange of </p><p>cannon courtesies between the Aquidaban </p><p>and the fort. An officer at Santa Cruz was </p><p>to signal me when Mello left his anchorage </p><p>and then, towing the submerged torpedo by </p><p>wire rope too small to be detected, I would </p><p>steam out across the. course of the Aqui- </p><p>daban, which would pick up the towing-line </p><p>on her bow, drag the torpedo alongside and </p><p>be destroyed by the contact. </p><p> The line was 2,000 feet long, supported at</p><p>intervals by little floats painted the color of </p><p>the water. I did not think Mello would see </p><p>anything suspicious in an insignificant little </p><p>towboat, under the British flag, running </p><p>diagonally across his bow at a distance of </p><p>a quarter of a mile. There never has been </p><p>any doubt in my mind that the plan would </p><p>have worked perfectly but for the fact that </p><p>Mello’s spies in high places had kept him </p><p>constantly advised as to what we were </p><p>doing.</p><p> My tug, in charge of a French engineer</p><p>and four Brazilians, was sent down to me on </p><p>the afternoon of September 25th, and as soon </p><p>as it was dark, with the torpedo covered with </p><p>canvas on deck and twelve 50-pound boxes </p><p>of dynamite in the pilot house, we steamed </p><p>around to Nictheroy Bay. To have loaded </p><p>the torpedo before we started would have </p><p>been extremely dangerous, for any acci- </p><p>dental pressure on one of its arms would </p><p>have blown all of us to pieces. We anchored </p><p>well out of sight of the rebel fleet, and as </p><p>soon as it was daylight I unscrewed the </p><p>manhole of the torpedo and proceeded to </p><p>pack it full of dynamite. </p><p>CAPTURED BY THE BRITISH </p><p>I WAS just putting in the last box of the </p><p>explosive when there was a shrill whistle, </p><p>and a launch from the Sirius swung along- </p><p>side. The lieutenant in charge jumped </p><p>aboard of us and came aft before I could </p><p>brush the dynamite from my arms. </p><p> “Who commands this craft?” he de-</p><p>manded. </p><p> “I do,” I replied,</p><p> “What are you doing with that flag up</p><p>there?” pointing to the British ensign. </p><p> “That flag was there when I came aboard</p><p>and took command,” I said, which was true. </p><p>“I am flying it for protection from a pirate </p><p>fleet, just as others are displaying it on Rio </p><p>Bay and in the city. Your commanding </p><p>officer has sanctioned that custom by his </p><p>silence. I am an officer of the established </p><p>Brazilian Government, obeying the orders </p><p>of my superiors in Brazilian waters, and I </p><p>claim the right to take advantage of that </p><p>custom, if I care to do so, just as others have </p><p>done and are doing.” </p><p> “I think the other cases are different from</p><p>yours,” replied the lieutenant. “What is </p><p>that? ” pointing to the dynamite. </p><p> “Examine it for yourself.”</p><p> “It looks like dynamite.”</p><p> “Probably.”</p><p> “ Well, sir, I am ordered by Captain Lang</p><p>to take you on board Her Majesty’s ship </p><p>Sirius.” </p><p> It was of no use to make a fight, so I ac-</p><p>companied him, with excessive and sarcastic </p><p>politeness. He took all my crew with him, </p><p>leaving a guard on the tug. Captain Lang </p><p>was on deck waiting for me and was quite </p><p>agitated when I was brought before him, but </p><p>he was much more heated before we parted </p><p>company, and it was a warm day to begin </p><p>with. </p><p>326</p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Captain Boynton, what does this</p><p>mean? ” he roared at me. </p><p> “What does what mean?” I innocently</p><p>answered. </p><p> “Your lying over there in a vessel loaded</p><p>with munitions of war and flying the British </p><p>flag!” </p><p> “It means simply that I am an officer in</p><p>the Brazilian army, on duty under the guns </p><p>of a rebel fleet, and that I am flying the </p><p>British flag for whatever virtue it might </p><p>have in protecting me from that pirate, </p><p>Admiral Mello. That flag has been used as </p><p>a protection by many others and you have </p><p>silently acquiesced in such use of it.” </p><p> “But, sir, are you not aware that this is</p><p>piracy?” </p><p> “I am not aware, sir, that it is any such</p><p>thing.” </p><p> “ But I tell you that it is piracy to fly the</p><p>British flag over the ship of another nation </p><p>and carrying munitions of war!” </p><p> “It might be just as well, Captain Lang,</p><p>for you to remember that you are not now </p><p>on the high seas. An act of the British </p><p>Parliament is of no effect within another </p><p>country, and if you will consult your chart </p><p>you will find that we are in the enclosed </p><p>waters of Brazil. Under such conditions no </p><p>mandate of yours which effects my rights </p><p>can be enforced unless you have the nerve </p><p>to take the chances that go with your act.” </p><p>“You may soon find to the contrary!” </p><p>shouted the Captain, who was letting his </p><p>temper get the best of him. “ I have a mind </p><p>to send you to Admiral Mello as a prisoner! </p><p>You know what he would do to you!” </p><p> “Oh, Captain Lang!” I said jeeringly.</p><p>“You know you wouldn’t do that!” </p><p> “And pray why not, sir?”</p><p> “Because you dare not do it, and that's</p><p>why!” I told him, as I pointed to the </p><p>Charleston, which, with her decks cleared for </p><p>action, was anchored only a few hundred </p><p>yards off to port. “I dare you to do it! </p><p>[ defy you to do it! Send me aboard the </p><p>Iquidaban if you dare!” </p><p> I was making a strong bluff and I got</p><p>away with it. The outraged Britisher </p><p>swelled up with anger and turned almost </p><p>purple, but he did not reply to my taunt. </p><p>Instead, he summoned the master at arms </p><p>and placed me in his charge, ordered his </p><p>launch and dashed off to the Charleston. </p><p>He returned in half an hour and without </p><p>another word to me ordered a lieutenant to </p><p>take me aboard the Charleston.</p><p> I WILL not deny that I was a bit</p><p>. . easier in my mind when I saw my </p><p>L—3 own flag flying over me, yet had </p><p>I known the treatment I was to receive </p><p>under it I would have felt quite differently. </p><p> It was easy to see, from the reception</p><p>Captain Picking gave me, that he had been </p><p>influenced by the attitude of Captain Lang. </p><p>I told him that I was an American citizen, </p><p>temporarily in the employment of the Bra- </p><p>zilian Government; that I had violated no </p><p>law of the United States or of Brazil, and </p><p>I demanded that I be set ashore. He coldly </p><p>informed me that I would be confined to the </p><p>ship, at least until he had consulted with the </p><p>American Minister and communicated with </p><p>Washington, and soon after I arrived on the </p><p>Charleston I was confined to my room, as </p><p>a dangerous character who threatened the </p><p>peace of nations. With this decidedly un- </p><p>pleasant recollection, however, it is a pleas- </p><p>ure to know that the other American naval </p><p>officers, who arrived later, took exactly my </p><p>view of the whole situation and became </p><p>champions of my cause. They told Picking </p><p>that Mello was a pirate and should be </p><p>treated as such, and that I was being de- </p><p>prived of my liberty without the slightest </p><p>warrant of law, but they were powerless to </p><p>accomplish my release. </p><p>THE “DETROIT” SHOWS HER TEETH </p><p>LOOKING forward a little, the manner in </p><p>which that old fighter, Rear Admiral </p><p>Benham, put an end to the “revolution” in </p><p>the following January, soon after his arrival </p><p>at Rio, should be well remembered, for it </p><p>was a noble deed and an example of the’good </p><p>judgment generally displayed by American </p><p>naval officers when they are not hampered </p><p>by foolish orders from Washington. In the </p><p>vain hope of arousing enthusiasm for his lost </p><p>cause, Mello had gone down the coast, </p><p>where he figuratively and literally took to </p><p>the woods when he saw the folly of his mis- </p><p>sion, leaving Da Gama in command of the </p><p>blockading fleet. The captains of several </p><p>American merchant ships, who had been </p><p>prevented for weeks from landing their car- </p><p>goes for Rio, appealed to Admiral Benham. </p><p>who took prompt action. </p><p> To show his contempt for the rebels,</p><p>whom he properly regarded as pirates, </p><p>Admiral Benham assigned the smallest ship </p><p>in his squadron, the little Detroit, com- </p><p>manded by that great little man. Com- </p><p>m: </p><p>Looking for Trouble </p><p>327</p><p>mander (now Rear Admiral, retired) W. H. </p><p>Brownson, to escort the merchantmen up to </p><p>the docks. At the same time he warned </p><p>Da Gama not to carry out his threat to fire </p><p>on them when they crossed his line. With </p><p>his ship cleared for action, Brownson stood </p><p>in alongside one of the merchantmen. He </p><p>steamed over close to the Trajano, on which </p><p>Da Gama’s flag was flying and which, with </p><p>the Guanabara, was guarding the shore. </p><p> “I will recognize no accidental shots,”</p><p>shouted Brownson to the rebel Admiral, “so </p><p>don’t fire any ! If you open firel will respond, </p><p>and if you reply to that I will sink you!” </p><p> As the merchant ship came in line the</p><p>Trajano fired a shot across her bow. Brown- </p><p>son replied instantly with a six-pound shell </p><p>which exploded so close to the Trajano that </p><p>it threw the water on her forward deck. </p><p>A musket-shot was fired from the Guana- </p><p>bara and it was answered and silenced with </p><p>a bullet from the Detroit. </p><p> After seeing his charge safely tied up to</p><p>dock, Brownson circled contemptuously </p><p>around the Trajano and ordered a marine to </p><p>send a rifle-shot into her stempost, as an </p><p>evidence of his esteem for her commander. </p><p>The discomfited Da Gam^, who was looking </p><p>for someexcuse to end his hopeless revolt, fell </p><p>over himself getting into his launch, raced </p><p>over to the Detroit and tendered his sword to </p><p>Brownson. The American told him he had </p><p>not demanded his surrender, as he seemed </p><p>to think, and could not accept it, but that he </p><p>must keep his hands off American shipping if </p><p>he wished to continue his mortal existence. </p><p> The “revolution” ended right there, but</p><p>unfortunately I was not present to witness </p><p>its collapse. The august naval authorities </p><p>were scandalized w'hen this display of good </p><p>sense was reported to them and they care- </p><p>fully prepared a message of censure to Ben- </p><p>ham for permitting such conduct, but before </p><p>it was despatched the New York morning </p><p>newspapers reached Washington, and after </p><p>a perusal of their enthusiastic editorials on </p><p>the subject, a message of commendation was </p><p>sent to him instead. </p><p>DURING my confinement on the </p><p>Charleston I was occasionally allowed </p><p>on deck for exercise, but I had no </p><p>other diversion than to watch the intermit- </p><p>tent bombardment of the city and the regu- </p><p>larly scheduled exchange of shots between </p><p>the rebel fleet and the forts. In hope of </p><p>meeting with greater success, Mello would </p><p>sometimes engage the forts with several of </p><p>his ships, and as time wore on thefe was</p><p>some improvement in the marksmanship on </p><p>both sides, though nothing like reasonable </p><p>accuracy was eyer attained. The only in- </p><p>cident which was at all exciting was the </p><p>sinking of the Javary, one of Mello’s moni- </p><p>tors. A shell from Fort Sao Joao dropped </p><p>between her turrets and, as she heeled over </p><p>from the explosion, an accidental shot from </p><p>Fort Santa Cruz struck her below the water- </p><p>line. She went down by the stem with </p><p>a rush. The guns in her forward turret </p><p>were pointed toward the town and they were </p><p>fired, in a spirit of sheer bravado, just as she </p><p>disappeared. Mello threw a few shells into </p><p>the city every day, as evidence that he was </p><p>still in rebellion, but I was told that less than </p><p>half a dozen of them did any damage and </p><p>they certainly produced little excitement. </p><p>Soldanha da Gama came out in the open and </p><p>joined forces with Mello while I was on the </p><p>Charleston. </p><p> I was not allowed to communicate with</p><p>any one on shore, and, except from hearsay, </p><p>Floriano had no means of knowing whether </p><p>I was alive or dead. Captain Picking </p><p>claimed to have been told by a church digni- </p><p>tary, who of course was a friend of Mello, </p><p>that it would be unsafe to set me ashore, as </p><p>I was certain to be assassinated by Mello sym- </p><p>pathizers, but that doubtless was a subterfuge </p><p>by which he sought to justify his position. </p><p> After I had been subjected to this out-</p><p>rageous treatment for two months, I was </p><p>suddenly transferred to the Detroit, which </p><p>immediately put to sea. Off Cape Frio we </p><p>met another Sirius, a Lamport &amp; Holt liner </p><p>bound for New York, and, in charge of </p><p>Ensign James F. Carter, I was transferred to </p><p>her. We reached New York December 19, </p><p>1893, and I was taken to the Brooklyn Navy </p><p>Yard. An hour after my arrival a message </p><p>was received from Washington ordering my </p><p>release. The Navy Department, in line </p><p>with the vacillating policy then in vogue, </p><p>took that method of getting me away from </p><p>the danger-zone. </p><p>VENEZUELA </p><p>THE ORINOCO COMPANY </p><p>IT WAS in vexed Venezuela that I was </p><p>destined to end my days of deviltry, but </p><p>not until after a protracted warfare, none </p><p>the less bitter because it was conducted at </p><p>328 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>long range, with Castro the Contemptible, </p><p>who came into power two years after 1 had </p><p>finally settled down at Santa Catalina as </p><p>manager for the Orinoco Company. Cipri-</p><p>ano Castro had been in Congress as Dipu- </p><p>tado, or Member of the House, from one of </p><p>the Andean districts while I was in Caracas </p><p>with President Crespo, and, though he was </p><p>regarded as a good fighter and a disturbing </p><p>element, he was never considered as a Presi- </p><p>dential possibility. </p><p> With all of my hatred for Castro and</p><p>everything pertaining to him, it must be </p><p>admitted that he was an exceedingly shrewd </p><p>scoundrel. Had he been half as honest he </p><p>could have made himself the greatest man </p><p>in South America. He supported Anduesa </p><p>Palacio, the deposed President, who had be- </p><p>trayed Guzman Blanco, in his final cam- </p><p>paign against Crespo, before the latter was </p><p>recognized as Dictator, and defeated Gen- </p><p>eral Morales in the battle of Tariba, May </p><p>15, 1892. For some time after that he was </p><p>in full control of that section of the country, </p><p>but with the firm establishment of the new </p><p>regime he gave up the fight. </p><p> In recognition of the military ability he</p><p>had displayed, Crespo offered to make him </p><p>Collector of Customs at Puerto Cabello. </p><p>He declined the position, but, egotistically </p><p>exaggerating the purpose of the proffer, </p><p>pompously promised Crespo that he would </p><p>not attempt to overthrow his Government. </p><p>He then came to Congress, where he would </p><p>have been almost unnoticed but for the </p><p>amusement he created by solemnly remov- </p><p>ing his shoes and putting on black kid gloves </p><p>every time he sat down to the—to him— </p><p>herculean task of drafting a bill. He was as </p><p>rough and uncouth as the rest of the moun- </p><p>taineers; short of stature, secretive of mind </p><p>and suspicious of every one, excepting only </p><p>a few of his brother brigands from the Andes. </p><p> At the expiration of this term he returned</p><p>to the hills and bought a farm just across </p><p>the Colombian border. He posed as a cat- </p><p>tle-raiser, but all of the reports that reached </p><p>Caracas said he was much more of a cattle- </p><p>rustler, or stealer. He was a persistent tax- </p><p>dodger, and his herd—which was said to </p><p>show fifty different brands that represented </p><p>as many thefts—was driven back and forth </p><p>across the border to avoid the Venezuelan </p><p>and Colombian collectors. He was engaged </p><p>in this profitable pastime when I left Cara- </p><p>cas, and had disappeared from all political </p><p>and revolutionary calculations. </p><p>I FIRST arrived at Santa Catalina, </p><p>whither I had gone on the urgent </p><p>advice of Crespo, early in 1896. It </p><p>was a straggling little town, with the com- </p><p>pany’s headquarters standing close to the</p><p>bank of the Piacoa River, a branch of the </p><p>Orinoco, opposite the lower end of the Is- </p><p>land of Tortola—the “Iwana” of Sir Walter </p><p>-Raleigh. </p><p> The building contained a store, with</p><p>a large supply of goods adapted to the needs </p><p>of colonists in a new and tropical country, </p><p>and around it were carpenter-, blacksmith- </p><p>and machine-shops. The company also </p><p>owned three small steamers, which were </p><p>used to bring supplies from Trinidad and </p><p>run back and forth to Barrancas, thirty </p><p>miles upstream at the head of the Macareo </p><p>River, the main estuary of the Oriftoco, </p><p>through which all of the commerce passes. </p><p>The Atlantic Ocean was 150 riiiles below us, </p><p>and Ciudad Bolivar, the principal city on </p><p>the Orinoco and the head of all-the-year </p><p>navigation, was 180 miles above. </p><p> Tradition says that Santa Catalina was</p><p>named by Raleigh who, according to the </p><p>native story, camped there when he was </p><p>pushing his way up the Orinoco in search of </p><p>the fabled El Dorado, with its golden city </p><p>of Manoa. Just above Barrancas are the </p><p>ruins of a strong fort he built for a part of his </p><p>force while he went farther on up the river. </p><p>It is, perhaps, the irony of an unkind fate </p><p>which pursued the great adventurer, that </p><p>near this fort, from which searching parties-- </p><p>were sent out, is the rich mine of El Callao. </p><p>If Raleigh had been looking for gold by the </p><p>pound instead of by the ton, and had </p><p>searched more carefully, he probably would </p><p>have found enough to satisfy him. </p><p> Stretching away to unmeasured lengths</p><p>from the pin-prick the headquarters village </p><p>made in it, was the virgin forest, with its </p><p>wealth of gold and iron, rubber and asphalt, </p><p>and its square miles of mahogany, Spanish </p><p>cedar, rosewood, carapo, greenheart and </p><p>mora wood, all within the confines of our </p><p>concession. Far off to the southwest, in a </p><p>region I never could find time to explore, </p><p>was the mythical dwelling-place of the </p><p>people whom Raleigh described—though </p><p>only on the word of the natives—as having </p><p>no heads, but with eyes in their shoulders </p><p>and mouths in their chests, with a long mane </p><p>trailing out from their spines. Down the </p><p>Orinoco, half way to the coast, was Imitaca </p><p>Mountain, a great hill of iron ore which is </p><p>Looking for Trouble </p><p>329 </p><p>said to be one of the largest and richest </p><p>deposits of the precious metal in the world, </p><p>THE Jefe Civil at Catalina assisted </p><p>Pgj me in my effort to open up the coun-</p><p> try, and active operations were soon</p><p>under way. The natives, who were living </p><p>just as when Columbus discovered them </p><p>and wearing no more clothes that could be </p><p>noticed, were attracted by the prosperity </p><p>which it was presumed would follow our </p><p>development work, and little pueblos sprang </p><p>up along the river on both sides of us. </p><p> Our concession covered a territory larger</p><p>than the State of Massachusetts, nearly all of </p><p>which was terra incognita. It was out of the </p><p>question to think of trying to go all over it. </p><p>But for the boundary dispute between </p><p>Venezuela and England the Orinoco Com- </p><p>pany never would have secured its conces- </p><p>sion, for the shrewd Guzman granted it with </p><p>the idea that Americans would colonize the </p><p>territory and effectively resist the British </p><p>invasion. </p><p> In their progressive search for gold—the</p><p>continued pursuit of Raleigh’s will-o’-the- </p><p>wisp—the Englishmen in Guiana were ad- </p><p>vancing farther and farther into Venezuela </p><p>and carrying the boundary with them, or </p><p>claiming that it was always just ahead of </p><p>them; which, so far as Venezuela’s protests </p><p>went, amounted to the same thing. It was, </p><p>in fact, the sweet, siren song of gold that </p><p>caused the establishment of the three </p><p>Guianas, so that the British, French and </p><p>Dutch might prosecute the search under the </p><p>most favorable conditions. </p><p> An expedition I made Guianaward was</p><p>the hardest trip I have ever undertaken and </p><p>yet one of the most interesting. We had to </p><p>cut our own trail through the thick under- </p><p>brush and could carry few supplies, but it </p><p>was easy to live off the country. Not know- </p><p>ing what to make of us, the jaguar, puma, </p><p>tapir and ocelot came so close that they were </p><p>easily shot, while overhead were millions of </p><p>monkeys, parrots and macaws, to say noth- </p><p>ing of great snakes that would have made </p><p>the fortune of a menagerie manager. </p><p>&gt; At long intervals we encountered a few </p><p>wild Indians, living 011 the banks of rivers, </p><p>who were terrified until they found we were </p><p>not tax-collectors sent to take them into </p><p>slavery on account of their inability to pay </p><p>extortionate taxes levied for no other pur- </p><p>pose than to compel them to work for </p><p>years without pay. When they became con- </p><p>vinced that we meant them no harm they </p><p>were very friendly and generously offered us </p><p>things to eat, which I was afraid to touch. </p><p>They never had seen a white man before and </p><p>I regretted that some of my friends were not </p><p>hidden in the bushes to witness the rever-</p><p>ence they showed me. </p><p> They were armed with bows and arrows,</p><p>which they used with wonderful accuracy, </p><p>and crudely fashioned spears, and wore </p><p>nothing much but feathers in their hair. </p><p>Theyiived on fish and game, with yams and </p><p>plantains, and sometimes corn, as side </p><p>dishes, and native fruits for dessert, and. they </p><p>were the healthiest looking people I have </p><p>ever seen. I pushed into this veritable par- </p><p>adise for all of a hundred miles, which car- </p><p>ried me close to the border, and discovered </p><p>one outcropping of gold which will some day </p><p>be developed into a rich property.. Our </p><p>progress was so slow that it was two months </p><p>before we were back in Catalina. </p><p> a “popular” election and a revolt</p><p>AFTER getting the development work </p><p>well started I returned to Caracas and </p><p>early in 1897 resumed my old confidential </p><p>position with President Crespo. His term </p><p>expired the following February and I found </p><p>that he,had already decided on General </p><p>Ignacio Andrade as his successor. He had </p><p>planned to continue as dictator of the coun- </p><p>try, a la Guzman, and spend much of his </p><p>idle time and money abroad, and he </p><p>wanted a man who could be relied on to keep </p><p>his organization intact and turn the office </p><p>back to him at the end of his term, for the </p><p>Venezuelan constitution prohibits a Presi- </p><p>dent from succeeding himself. </p><p> Donna Crespo, who besides being the</p><p>greatest smuggler in the country was </p><p>a shrewd judge of men, had taken a pro- </p><p>nounced dislike to Andrade and advised </p><p>strongly against his selection. Without </p><p>knowing how truly she spoke, she predicted </p><p>that if Andrade was made President, Crespo </p><p>would be dead within six months. I added </p><p>my advice to the Donna’s, for I knew An- </p><p>drade was a weak man and one who could </p><p>not be trusted. Powerful friends of Crespo </p><p>in Trinidad also urged him to select a </p><p>stronger man, but he could not be moved. </p><p>He credited Andrade with having saved his </p><p>life, and planned that he should be made </p><p>President by the first “popular election” in </p><p>the history of Venezuela. The peons idolized </p><p>33« </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Crespo and he had such a strong grip on the </p><p>country that he was able to carry out his </p><p>plan, but with disastrous results. </p><p> On election day the soldiers at Gualira,</p><p>Guarenas and Petare doffed their uniforms </p><p>and donned blouses, with their revolvers </p><p>strapped on underneath, marched to the</p><p>polls and voted as often as was required. </p><p>Other towns throughout the country wit- </p><p>nessed the same performance. The peons </p><p>also voted for Andrade, either because they </p><p>knew Crespo wanted them to or because the </p><p>soldiers so instructed them, and they kept at </p><p>it until the designated number of votes had </p><p>been deposited. For a popular election it </p><p>was tlae weirdest thing that could be </p><p>imagined. </p><p> It was immediately followed by mutter-</p><p>ings of discontent from the better class of </p><p>citizens and on the night of Andrade’s in- </p><p>auguration General Hernandez, the famed </p><p>“El Mocho,” who was Minister of Public </p><p>Improvements in Crespo’s Cabinet but an </p><p>opponent of the new President, took to the </p><p>hills at the head of 3,000 troops. Crespo </p><p>really was responsible for the curse of Cas- </p><p>tro, for had he selected a strong man as his </p><p>successor the mountain brigand never could </p><p>have commanded a force sufficiently power- </p><p>ful to overthrow him. </p><p>WITHIN a month. Andrade went </p><p>through the form of appointing </p><p>Crespo Commander in Chief of the </p><p>army, in order that he might clinch his </p><p>dictatorship. For a while Crespo con- </p><p>tented himself with enjoying his new title </p><p>and directing operations from the capital, </p><p>but the Hernandez revolution finally as- </p><p>sumed such proportions that he took the </p><p>field in person to stamp it out. The two </p><p>armies met in the mountains near Victoria, </p><p>June 12, 1898. Hernandez was led into </p><p>a trap, given a drubbing and captured. </p><p>After the battle Crespo walked across the </p><p>field and was leaning over a wounded man </p><p>when he was shot from behind and in- </p><p>stantly killed. </p><p> It was claimed that the shot was fired</p><p>from the bush by one of the escaped rebels, </p><p>but the bullet that killed Crespo was of </p><p>a peculiar pattern and exactly fitted the pis- </p><p>tol of one of his own officers, who was not </p><p>a Venezuelan. I doubt whether there was </p><p>another weapon exactly like it in the whole </p><p>country. The responsibility for the mur- </p><p>der could easily have been fixed, but the </p><p>cowardly Andrade refused to order a. real </p><p>investigation. Crespo’s body was packed </p><p>in a barrel of rum and brought to Caracas </p><p>for burial. </p><p> The capture of “El Mocho” checked the</p><p>spirit of revolt, but not for long. Andrade </p><p>had nothing to commend him but his hon- </p><p>esty, a quality so little understood in Vene- </p><p>zuela that it counted for nothing, and he be-</p><p>came more and more unpopular. Only in- </p><p>ability to agree on his successor prevented </p><p>his speedy overthrow. </p><p> Some few months after Crespo’s death,</p><p>Castro, who had made himself Governor of </p><p>the State of Los Andes, visited Caracas and </p><p>called on Andrade to demand an important </p><p>position in the new administration, as the </p><p>price of peace. Andrade, to his credit be it </p><p>said, flouted him. Castro left the Yellow </p><p>House in a rage, sought the councils of An- </p><p>drade’s enemies and, after many confer- </p><p>ences, a general insurrection was arranged </p><p>for early the following Summer. The Presi- </p><p>dency was to go to the leader who developed </p><p>the greatest strength during the campaign. </p><p>THE RISE OF CEPRIANO CASTRO </p><p>/‘‘^ASTROwent back to his mountain home </p><p>K J to discover that his cattle had been </p><p>seized and a warrant issued, at the instance </p><p>of Andrade’s friends, for his arrest for cattle- </p><p>stealing. He resorted to his old trick of </p><p>dodging across the border, but a similar </p><p>warrant was secured from the Colombian </p><p>Government, which had no more love for </p><p>the Indian upstart than had the one at </p><p>Caracas; in fact, Castro at one time seri- </p><p>ously considered starting a revolt in Colom- </p><p>bia in the hope of gaining the Presidency. </p><p> With officers of both countries searching</p><p>for him he went into hiding and remained </p><p>under cover until May 23, 1899, when he </p><p>invaded Venezuela with a force of sixty </p><p>pemiUeros, so called from the fact that they </p><p>were armed with the peinilla, a sword shaped </p><p>like a scimitar. They were the lowest type </p><p>of Indian, but they were brave and hard </p><p>fighters. His old cattle-rustling neighbors </p><p>hailed him with joy, for until then they </p><p>never had dreamed that any man from the </p><p>mountains could become a really important </p><p>factor in Venezuelan affairs, and more than </p><p>a thousand of them flocked to his standard. </p><p>He encountered little opposition, and as he </p><p>captured successive towns he opened the </p><p>prisons and the freed convicts fell in behind </p><p>Looking for Trouble </p><p>33i </p><p>him. When he reached Valencia, less than </p><p>one hundred miles from Caracas, he had an </p><p>undisciplined but effective force of 3,000 </p><p>bloodthirsty brigands. General Ferrer was </p><p>stationed there with 6,000 well-equipped </p><p>regulars and, though he was by no means </p><p>enthusiastic in his loyalty to Andrade, he </p><p>did his duty as a soldier, according to the </p><p>quaint standards of the country. </p><p> He marched his men out and surrounded</p><p>Castro, with the exception of a conspicuous </p><p>hole through which he could escape, and </p><p>then went into camp for the night. This </p><p>proceeding was in strict accord with the </p><p>ethics of that strange land. Except in ex- </p><p>treme cases it is the unwritten law that </p><p>when a rebel leader is encountered by a su- </p><p>perior Government force, the regulars must </p><p>surround him with a great show but be care- </p><p>ful to leave a wide hole in their line through </p><p>which he can run away during the night. </p><p>Invariably he takes advantage of his oppor- </p><p>tunity and it is officially announced that he </p><p>“escaped.” Of course, after a rebel chief- </p><p>tain has made several escapes of this kind </p><p>and still continues in revolt he is surrounded </p><p>in earnest, but harsh measures are not re- </p><p>sorted to until he has had ample oppor- </p><p>tunity to escape or come into camp and </p><p>be good. </p><p> Castro violated all precedents by failing to</p><p>run through the hole that had been left for </p><p>him. When Ferrer saw him the next </p><p>morning in the middle of the ring, calmly </p><p>waging for the fight to begin, he was non- </p><p>plussed. He could not understand that </p><p>method of warfare and, concluding that </p><p>Castro must be a real hero and perhaps, </p><p>as he even then claimed to be, a genuine </p><p>“man of destiny,” he solved the problem </p><p>by joining forces with him, for which he </p><p>was subsequently rewarded by being made </p><p>Minister of War. </p><p>CASTRO learned from Ferrer that </p><p>he was alone in the revolution, his </p><p>promised partners having failed to </p><p>take the field on account of bickerings and </p><p>jealousies among themselves. This discov- </p><p>ery and the addition of Ferrer’s forces gave </p><p>him his first really serious notion that he </p><p>might become President and he marched </p><p>forward in a frenzy of bombastic joy. He </p><p>picked out a star as his own and ceremoni- </p><p>ously worshipped it. At Victoria, only </p><p>thirty-five miles outside of the capital, he </p><p>made terms with General Mendoza, who </p><p>was disgruntled with Andrade, and picked </p><p>up another army. </p><p> When the tottering President heard of</p><p>this final evidence of disloyalty he boarded </p><p>a gunboat at La Guayra, taking with him </p><p>a well-filled treasure-chest, and went to </p><p>Trinidad. The alleged warship leaked </p><p>badly and Andrade, who had a sense of </p><p>humor, sent word back to Castro by her </p><p>commander to have her repaired at once so </p><p>that she would be in better shape for a hur- </p><p>ried departure when it came his turn to be</p><p>deposed. </p><p> By this time the people of Venezuela,</p><p>believing that no one could be worse than </p><p>Andrade, and finding out, as had Castro </p><p>himself, what a powerful person he really </p><p>was, accepted him as their master. He en- </p><p>tered Caracas without opposition October </p><p>21, 1900, and, rejecting the modest title of </p><p>Provisional President, which his predeces- </p><p>sors had used, proclaimed himself Jefe </p><p>Supremo, or “Supreme Military Leader.” </p><p> He filled all important posts with men</p><p>from the mountains, on whose loyalty he </p><p>could rely, and as they were able to secure </p><p>plenty of graft, not one penny of which was </p><p>overlooked, he very soon had a tight hold on </p><p>the country, One of his first acts was to </p><p>release General Hernandez. He soon found </p><p>that the old warrior was too patriotic and </p><p>too dangerous to be at large, so he slapped </p><p>him back into San Carlos, on the pretense </p><p>that he was planning an insurrection, and </p><p>kept him there for years. </p><p> March 30, 1901, Castro was elected by</p><p>Congress to fill out the unexpired part of </p><p>Andrade’s term, and in the following Febru- </p><p>ary he was elected Constitutional President. </p><p>Then began in earnest his reign of robbery, </p><p>through the establishment of monopolies </p><p>whose profits went to his private purse, and </p><p>his vicious,anti-foreign policy which, through </p><p>the murders and injustices committed in its </p><p>name, made the Boxer uprising in China </p><p>look like a soft-spoken protest. </p><p> I WAS not in Caracas to witness the</p><p>advent of Castro, as I had returned </p><p>to Catalina more than two years be- </p><p>fore, immediately after Crespo’s funeral. </p><p>I had come into possession of a block of </p><p>stock in the Orinoco Company, which made </p><p>it better worth my while to stay with it. </p><p>But it was only the influence of the Jefe </p><p>Civile that had kept the natives in bounds </p><p>before, and with the death of my friend, </p><p>33 2 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Crespo, that official suddenly became at </p><p>least lukewarm in his loyalty to the law and </p><p>to me. </p><p> It naturally followed that the natives</p><p>overran the concession, refused to pay roy- </p><p>alty on the balata gum, which they carried </p><p>off in enormous quantities, and stole every- </p><p>thing except the headquarters building and </p><p>the iron ore, which was too heavy and not </p><p>worth while. Extortions of all sorts were </p><p>winked at or openly approved. As An- </p><p>drade’s unpopularity increased, natives took</p><p>sides and began to spy on each other, with </p><p>the result that false and malicious reports </p><p>were sent to Caracas as to the company’s </p><p>attitude. </p><p> When Castro took the field Andrade as-</p><p>sumed a much more friendly air, but it was </p><p>too late to be of any value, He sent Gen- </p><p>eral Marina up the Orinoco to try to arouse </p><p>enthusiasm for his cause in the east, which </p><p>furnishes the only soldiers that can cope </p><p>with the hardy mountaineers of the west. </p><p>Mariana told me that if I did my best to </p><p>hold my district in line for Andrade, the </p><p>President would grant anything I asked </p><p>as soon as the revolt was suppressed. At </p><p>just about the moment this request was </p><p>made Andrade was fleeing from La Guayra, </p><p>and Castro was assuming full control at </p><p>Caracas, </p><p> CASTRO AND THE ORINOCO CONCESSION</p><p>ALMOST the first thing he did was to </p><p>- annul our concession, along with a </p><p>dozen others, on the ground that its terms </p><p>had not been complied with, as the begin- </p><p>ning of his war on all foreigners. I denied </p><p>this right to cancel our grant, especially as it </p><p>contained a clause which stipulated that any </p><p>disagreement between the Government and </p><p>the concessionaire should be referred to the </p><p>Alta Corte Federal, or Supreme Court, for </p><p>adjustment. As the case had not been </p><p>brought before that court I held there could </p><p>be no legal annulment, even if that power </p><p>did rest in the executive, which I denied. </p><p>This contention was subsequently upheld by </p><p>the International Court of Arbitration, fol- </p><p>lowing the blockade and bombardment of </p><p>the allied Powers, which decided that our </p><p>concession was still in full force. </p><p> When Castro saw that we did not propose</p><p>to submit to his arbitrary annulment and </p><p>realizing that so long as I remained on the </p><p>concession we could claim to be in full pos- </p><p> session, he proceeded to harass me in every</p><p>conceivable way in the hope of making it too </p><p>hot for me. Under our contract we were </p><p>to nominate and pay all of the officers within </p><p>our territory, and the Government was to </p><p>appoint them. My old chief of police, </p><p>Abreu, was arrested and taken away on some </p><p>false charge, and a new man, Tinoco, in </p><p>whose selection I had no voice, was sent to </p><p>take his place. He was, I learned, a spy and </p><p>had orders to send in reports which would </p><p>make it appear that the company was stir- </p><p>ring up revolts and otherwise violating the </p><p>terms of its concession. This I discovered </p><p>in time to induce Tinoco, with the aid of</p><p>a pistol, to sign a statement in which hc- </p><p>denied all of his dishonest reports and gave </p><p>the company a clean bill of health. He died </p><p>soon afterward. </p><p> Castro created a military district kn'owii</p><p>as the Territorio Delta-Amacuro, which </p><p>took in all of our property, and made Cata- </p><p>lina the capital, so that the Governor and </p><p>the other officials could keep me ufider their </p><p>eyes. They all had instructions to* .make </p><p>the place so uncomfortable for me that J </p><p>would leave. Fortunately, when itrecSved </p><p>its concession the company had bought the </p><p>land on which its buildings were erected. </p><p>Only the fact that I was an American cit- </p><p>izen and held the deeds to the property </p><p>restrained them from expelling me by main </p><p>force and awkwardness. However, I could </p><p>see trouble coming, so I dug rifle-pits under </p><p>the porches on the two sides of the hoase </p><p>from which we could be attacked. I had </p><p>plenty of arms and ammunition and about </p><p>twenty men of whose bravery and loyalty </p><p>I was sure. </p><p> I was prohibited from buying anything</p><p>at the pidperia, or commissary, and we were </p><p>hard put to it at times for enough to eat. </p><p>We caught fish in the river, and my men </p><p>stole out into the woods to hunt at ever}' </p><p>favorable opportunity, but the moment they </p><p>left our property they exposed themselves </p><p>to arrest on some trumped-up charge. Some- </p><p>times we were able surreptitiously to buy </p><p>supplies from the natives, and we managed </p><p>to get along. I filed protests at Caracas, </p><p>with the Governor and with my company, </p><p>but they accomplished nothing. I was told </p><p>by the officials of the company that they </p><p>were doing the best they could, with repre- </p><p>sentations to the State Department at </p><p>Washington, and that I would have to do </p><p>the best I could, and I did it. </p><p>Looking for Trouble </p><p>333 </p><p>THE troops were continually spy- </p><p>ing on us and annoying us with ficti- </p><p>tious charges, but it was a year or </p><p>more before the Government, angered by its </p><p>failure to get rid of me, resorted to extreme </p><p>measures. A new Governor was sent down </p><p>with strict orders to remove me, by force if </p><p>necessary. He advanced toward the house </p><p>with about seventy-five soldiers. I ordered </p><p>ray men into the rifle-pits and met the Gen- </p><p>eral at the gate. </p><p> “What- do you want?” I demanded</p><p>fiercely. </p><p> “I beg your pardon,” replied the com-</p><p>mander, with all the treacherous suavity of </p><p>his race, “but I have orders to take you </p><p>under my care and escort you to Trinidad </p><p>in order that no injury may come to you. </p><p>Our country is troubled and the Govern- </p><p>ment is anxious as to your safety.” </p><p> “My compliments to President Castro,”</p><p>I told him, “and assure him that I feel per- </p><p>fectly secure here, and quite comfortable. </p><p>Ypu can also tell him that I propose to stay </p><p>heffe.” </p><p>. “That is much to be regretted,” re- </p><p>sponded the still overly polite general, “for </p><p>in that case I have to inform you that my </p><p>orders are to arrest you and take you to </p><p>Trinidad.” </p><p> “In that case,” I said, imitatively, “1</p><p>have to inform you that you will, find it </p><p>impossible to carry out your orders and </p><p>I advise you not to attempt it!” </p><p> “You mean that you will resist arrest?”</p><p>he exclaimed in surprise. </p><p> “Most assuredly,” I replied. “This is</p><p>my property. You have no right to invade </p><p>it, for 1 have violated no law of Venezuela. </p><p>If you enter on it, I will fire on you!” </p><p> “But,” he almost shouted, as he waved</p><p>his arms excitedly toward his ennervated </p><p>patiiots, “my men are here to enforce my </p><p>orders! You would be insane to resist! </p><p>You do not know the Venezuelan army, sir! ” </p><p>“You are mistaken,” I told him. “I do </p><p>know the Venezuelan army. It is you who </p><p>are ignorant. You do not know my army! </p><p>It is because I know both that I have no </p><p>fear. You have not a shadow of right for </p><p>seeking to arrest me, and your blood will be </p><p>on your own head if you advance!” </p><p> With this declaration which, in keeping</p><p>with the comic-opera custom of the country, </p><p>was delivered with all the dramatic effort </p><p>I could throw into it, in order that it might </p><p>earn,- greater weight, I retired to the house. </p><p>WE HAVE A LITTLE FIGHT </p><p>THE General could see my rifle-pits, but </p><p>he did not know how many men they </p><p>held nor how well they could shoot. After </p><p>a short consultation with his staff, he gave </p><p>the order to advance, while he bravely </p><p>directed operations from the rear. As his </p><p>men crossed the line we fired and eight of </p><p>them fell. They continued to advance and </p><p>we fired again, dropping nine more of them, </p><p>while several others were hit. That was too </p><p>much for them and they broke and ran, </p><p>leaving seven dead and ten badly wounded. </p><p> They did not fire a shot, perhaps because</p><p>our men were so well concealed that Venezu-</p><p>elan marksmanship would have accom- </p><p>plished nothing against them. The Gen- </p><p>eral and his staff returned in an hour and </p><p>asked permission to remove his fallen war- </p><p>riors. After burying their dead they re- </p><p>turned to their steamer and went on up the </p><p>river. </p><p> In two or three days they came back, with</p><p>their force slightly increased, and the Gen- </p><p>eral again called on me to surrender under </p><p>penalty of being arrested as a disturbing </p><p>factor. I gave him the same reply as before </p><p>and, after thinking it over for a while, be </p><p>marched his troops away again. </p><p> That little encounter produced pro-</p><p>nounced respect for the Americans among </p><p>Castro’s soldiers and they did not give us </p><p>much trouble afterward, though they con- </p><p>tinued to annoy us for a time. With the </p><p>establishment of the blockade of Venezuelan </p><p>ports by the allies—England, Germany and </p><p>Italy—in the latter part of 1902, and the </p><p>signing of the peace protocols at Washington </p><p>early in the following year, there came a ces- </p><p>sation of hostilities against us. So far as </p><p>driving us off the concession was concerned, </p><p>Castro seemed to have given up the fight, </p><p>but on account of the disturbed condition of </p><p>the country and the fact that the Govern- </p><p>ment was known to be inimical to us, it was </p><p>impossible to do anything of consequence </p><p>toward the development of the property. </p><p> This enforced idleness eventually became</p><p>intolerable, and early in 1906, the company </p><p>in the meantime having sent one of its offi- </p><p>cers to Caracas to protect its interests, I </p><p>returned to New York, after having held </p><p>the fort for ten years. I came back </p><p>much poorer in pocket, but with a fund of </p><p>information regarding Venezuela and its </p><p>people. </p><p>334 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>poor Venezuela’s golden future </p><p>I HAVE been in every country in South </p><p>America, and have studied all of them, </p><p>and there is no possibility of doubt that </p><p>Venezuela is beyond comparison the richest </p><p>in its natural resources. With the setting </p><p>up of a firm and civilized government, which </p><p>must come in the end, under an American </p><p>protectorate if by no other means, all of the </p><p>fairy-stories that were told of it centuries </p><p>ago will come true, and its development will </p><p>eclipse all of the dreams that have been real- </p><p>ized in our own country. </p><p> It is a strange fact that Cumana, in Ven-</p><p>ezuela (their respective names then being</p><p>New Toledo and New Grenada), which was </p><p>the first European settlement in South </p><p>America of which there is authentic record, </p><p>was founded one hundred years, less one, </p><p>before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth </p><p>Sock. In each case there was a fervent </p><p>prayer for divine aid in establishing a Chris- </p><p>tian colony and building up a great country. </p><p>vVhy one prayer was answered and the other </p><p>was not is a question I will not attempt to </p><p>answer. </p><p> Like her West Indian neighbors—of which</p><p>beautiful isles Americans now know so little, </p><p>but of which they will know much more </p><p>when their flag flies over all of them, as it </p><p>must within the life of the present genera- </p><p>tion—Venezuela has been treated most </p><p>bountifully by nature and most brutally by </p><p>man Cursed they all may have been by </p><p>the seas of innocent blood in which they </p><p>were barbarously bathed during their ex- </p><p>tended infancy and their prolonged child- </p><p>hood, from which they have not yet </p><p>merged. It seems that all the powers of </p><p>darkness have conspired to retard their </p><p>growth and hold them slaves to savagery. </p><p>Accustomcd from the days of the Spanish </p><p>cmquistadores, and the pirates who followed </p><p>them, to being plundered and persecuted in </p><p>every way that the mercenary mind of man </p><p>could devise, the Venezuelans have grown </p><p>so hardened to turmoil and torture that it has </p><p>become second nature to them to live in an </p><p>atmosphere which generates riot and robbery. </p><p>Their blood is an unholy mixture of </p><p>Indian, Carib and Spanish, with other and </p><p>more recent strains of all sorts. They are </p><p>the most inconsequential, emotional, un- </p><p>grateful and treacherous people on the face </p><p>of the earth—and yet I love them. The </p><p>ambition of their leaders runs only to graft, </p><p>while the underlings yearn for war as a child </p><p>cries for a plaything. At the behest of some </p><p>self-constituted chieftain, who has strutted </p><p>in front of a mirror until he imagines him- </p><p>self a second Simon Bolivar, they rise in </p><p>rebellion because it gives them a chance to </p><p>prey on the country, and, if their revolt is </p><p>successful, to continue and extend their prey- </p><p>ing. But some day a real man will rise up </p><p>among them and lead them out of their </p><p>blackness and butchery into peace and pros- </p><p>perity, and Venezuela, with her wild waste </p><p>of wealth, will become great beyond the </p><p>imaginings of her discoverers. </p><p>THIS is not the full story of my life, </p><p>but it tells some of the incidents </p><p>that I have enjoyed the most. My</p><p>best fight was with old Moy Sen, the pirate </p><p>long, in the China Sea, and my closest </p><p>call was when I was sentenced to be shot at </p><p>sunrise in Santo Domingo. These events </p><p>supplied the most delightful feasts of the </p><p>excitement which my nature has ever </p><p>craved, yet I have lived well, in that respect, </p><p>all along. I have fought under nineteen </p><p>flags and I am proud of the fact that I gave </p><p>to each of them, and to every one of my </p><p>undertakings in a life-long search for adven- </p><p>ture, the best that was in me. </p><p> I have no disappointments and no regrctss</p><p>except that this existence is too short. If J. </p><p>had my life to live over again it would be </p><p>lived in the same way, though, I would </p><p>hope, with a still greater share of excite- </p><p>ment, because it was for just such a life that </p><p>I was created What the purpose of it was </p><p>I neither know nor care, nor am I in the </p><p>least concerned as to what my destiny next </p><p>holds in store for me. I hope, however, </p><p>that in some land with opportunity for </p><p>wide activity I will be reincarnated as a </p><p>filibuster and a buccaneer and that I will so </p><p>continue until my identity is merged into a </p><p>composite mass of kindred souls. </p><p>ft </p><p>J W“| WOKE suddenly in a strange </p><p>I place—a long room with light oak </p><p>I carving. I was lying on soft </p><p>l—m -J cushions on the floor. A rug had </p><p>been thrown over me, but I was dressed. </p><p>There were two long rows of sleepers—men </p><p>women, and children—and a number was </p><p>put at' the head of each. Mine was “214,- </p><p>713. London.” One or two numbers had </p><p>a name underneath, but mine was not there. </p><p>It was Elsie Anderson, if I remembered my- </p><p>self rightly; but my memories did not </p><p>come readily. </p><p> My left-hand neighbor was holding my</p><p>wrist. He was “ 184, Government, George </p><p>Raynor.” I remembered the name, and </p><p>when I raised myself on one elbow, to take </p><p>a good look at his face, I remembered </p><p>him. I had met him once at an at-home. </p><p>He was a nice fellow and I. liked him. He </p><p>had said that he hoped wc. should meet </p><p>again. </p><p> Next I noticed a manuscript in. my right</p><p>hand. I pulled it out and read the title: </p><p>“The History of the Years of Sleep: iqi6- </p><p>1920. By George Raynor.” </p><p> I gave a sharp cry. If it was 1920,1 had</p><p>slept for four years! I made an effort to </p><p>remember what happened to me. I was </p><p>going to town for a singing-lesson, and there</p><p>were swarms of little green flies at Dulwich </p><p>Station. They stung people, and the people </p><p>whom they stung fainted. I screamed and </p><p>tried to beat off the flies with my handker- </p><p>chief, but they flew upon me—and th?t was </p><p>the last thing I remembered. I must have </p><p>fainted; and the faint had lasted for four </p><p>years! Perhaps longer, for more years </p><p>might have passed since Mr. Raynor </p><p>wrote the history. </p><p> How had I come to this placer Where was</p><p>it? Who were the other sleepers? Why </p><p>did he put the book under my pillow? Why </p><p>did he hold my hand? I guessed that it was </p><p>a big hospital or building where they had </p><p>put the sleepers for their security; and </p><p>I thought that Mr. Raynor had brought me </p><p>chere because he knew me. and that he held </p><p>my hand because he expected me to be </p><p>■‘'lightened when I woke alone. I was </p><p>frightened—so frightened that I dared not </p><p>move or call. For I did not know what </p><p>might have happened in all these years, and </p><p>something dreadful must have come again </p><p>to send Mr. Raynor to sleep. </p><p>_ I lay still for a long time, shivering and </p><p>listening. I heard no sound but the faint </p><p>breathing of the sleepers. I thought that, </p><p>every one but myself must be asleep. Then </p><p>I heard a howling somewhere outside, the </p><p>bowling of wild beasts. It came nearer and </p><p>nearer, till at last it was outside the window. </p><p>The window seemed to be a good way above </p><p>the ground, but I wasn’t sure. I clung to </p><p>Mr. Raynor’s arm and begged him to wake, </p><p>but he did not stir. He and the rest were </p><p>evidently in a deep faint or stupor. I gave </p><p>a scream, and then I fainted, too. The </p><p>noise had gone when I recovered. </p><p> As soon as I was able to tise I got up and</p><p>staggered to the door, but dared not open </p><p>it. I staggered toward the windows, but </p><p>dared not look out. I feared to find the </p><p>world in the possession of the howling </p><p>beasts, or of some unknown monsters, I </p><p>went and shook Mr. Raynor again, and </p><p>BY OWEN OLIVER </p><p>335 </p><p>336 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>called in his ear, entreating him to wake, but </p><p>without the slightest effect. </p><p> I sat down again on my cushions—I</p><p>seemed to have been made more confortable </p><p>than any one else, and I was sure that I had </p><p>to thank Mr. Raynor for that—and took up </p><p>the “history”; but I was afraid to read it </p><p>and learn what horrible things had come to</p><p>pass—perhaps to find that I was all alone. </p><p>I prayed a prayer that some one might be </p><p>still waking in the world and come to me. </p><p>And then I heard voices in the passage. </p><p> At first I thought they came in answer to</p><p>my prayer, but, after listening for a few </p><p>moments, some instinct checked the call on </p><p>my lips. I went, cold with fear, and lay </p><p>down hastily and covered myself and the </p><p>book with the rug, and pretended to sleep. </p><p>“They are enemies,” I told myself. “Ene- </p><p>mies! If they should come in-!” </p><p> They came in, and I peeped at them under</p><p>my eyelashes. They were a red-faced, eld- </p><p>erly man and a gray-haired lady, with </p><p>a pale, handsome face and cold, cruel eyes. </p><p>It was she whom I feared. I think I should </p><p>have spoken to the man, if he had been </p><p>alone, though I did not like him. </p><p>RJjS “SINCE you will see him,”he said, </p><p>•Mf3 speaking as if she had annoyed him, </p><p>“there he is!” He jerked his head </p><p>toward Mr. Raynor, and she knelt beside </p><p>the unconscious sleeper. </p><p> “He is due to wake in three days?”</p><p>“Yes,” he answered; “and the girl the </p><p>day after, according to the books; but the </p><p>reinoculations do not always last their full </p><p>time, you know. She might happen to rouse </p><p>a day sooner; two or three days even.” </p><p>“Oh, she!” said the woman scornfully. </p><p>“She doesn’t matter. She goes to-night, </p><p>with the rest of them.” </p><p> “You can’t dispose of them’all,” the man</p><p>protested. “We must have some to fight </p><p>the cursed wolves. It’s no use shaking your </p><p>head. We must, I tell you! We needn’t </p><p>rouse them all, but I can’t get along without </p><p>a few thousand men. The beasts are get- </p><p>ting too much for me. You know what it </p><p>was like coming here.” </p><p> “Yes, yes,” she said “You can have</p><p>your men; but we don’t want women; at </p><p>any rate, not her. She dies to-night!” </p><p>“Very well,” he said rather sulkily. “ The </p><p>women can go—those of this batch. You’ll </p><p>have to save some of the later sections, or </p><p>you’ll have a mutiny. But it doesn’t mat- </p><p>ter about her in particular. She’s just an </p><p>ordinary, stupid, pretty girl, so far as I can </p><p>see. The only point is that he has an infatu- </p><p>ation about her. The important question </p><p>is, what are you going to do about him? </p><p>I rather like die chap, but-” </p><p> “I don’t know,” she said, rocking herself</p><p>to and fro. “ He has disobeyed three times. </p><p>I gave my word that the third time he </p><p>should die— He is so like my son! ”</p><p> “I suppose,” the red-faced man com-</p><p>mented, “your son was like you. If he is, </p><p>and he wakes and finds that you have made </p><p>away with this ‘214,713, London’ of his, </p><p>he’ll kill you! If you must wake him, why </p><p>not wake the girl and let him have her? </p><p>He’ll be all right then. If you kill her and </p><p>spare him, he’ll be our worst enemy. I warn </p><p>you.” </p><p> “ He’d be my enemy anyhow,” the woman</p><p>said bitterly. “He would not serve me as </p><p>I need service, for his own life, or even for </p><p>hers. They must go to-night with the rest </p><p>of their batch. Keep 6,000 men—no </p><p>women and children; 2,000 of them in </p><p>London. The rest in the usual propor- </p><p>tions. Telegraph at once. Yes. He must </p><p>die. But he’s like my son!” </p><p> She bent and kissed him, laughing a</p><p>strange laugh. It reminded me of the </p><p>howling of the beasts. Then she rose. </p><p> “My last weakness,” she said. “It’s</p><p>over. I shall go on to the end now, do not </p><p>fear.” </p><p> “I’ve never feared anything all my life,</p><p>except you,” the red-faced man said. </p><p>“Sometimes I think you’re the salvation of </p><p>the world. Sometimes I think you’re the </p><p>Devil! I don’t know.” </p><p> “I don’t know myself,” said the gray-</p><p>haired woman. </p><p> Then they went, and I fainted again.</p><p>WHEN I came to, I judged from </p><p>the light that it was the after- </p><p>noon. I felt weak and ill and very </p><p>thirsty, and so terrified that I could not </p><p>think properly. I believe I should have </p><p>simply lain still and waited to be killed, if </p><p>Mr. Raynor had not been before my eyes </p><p>and if I had not felt sure that I owed my </p><p>life, so far, to him. </p><p> “They shall not kill you!” I declared, and</p><p>sat up and clenched my teeth and hands, </p><p>and made myself consider what I could do </p><p>to save him. I decided that the first step </p><p>was to read the history, which would proba- </p><p>The Awakening </p><p>33? </p><p>biy enable me to understand the situation </p><p>better. </p><p> It. was a long story—far too long to set</p><p>down here; but the main points were these. </p><p> The fly—but some people said it was</p><p>a poison-dust, not an insect—appeared </p><p>everywhere, all over the world, August 24, </p><p>1916, and stung people into a dense stupor. </p><p>Nearly all the inhabitants of the earth went </p><p>into the sleep, the account said. Those</p><p>who remained awake were almost all clever, </p><p>cruel people. They formed new govern- </p><p>ments, and called the head people “Pow- </p><p>ers.” The Chief Power in England was the </p><p>gray-haired woman. Her name was Ash- </p><p>bury'. She did not wish the sleepers to </p><p>wake, because she wanted to go on ruling. </p><p>So she proposed to kill them. The Power </p><p>of the World, an American Jew named </p><p>Abrahams, who had been a hotel-keeper </p><p>and considered a bad and unscrupulous </p><p>man. but who was really a good one, </p><p>would not agree to this. But, when the </p><p>sleepers seemed likely, to wake, he had to </p><p>inoculate them, to make them sleep longer., </p><p>because there wasn’t food for them. </p><p> Ee tried to grow food, but the harvests</p><p>were bad, and the dogs, who had become </p><p>tike wolves from hunger, overran the coun- </p><p>try. There were pestilences and storms, and </p><p>those who “woke” were in great trouble; </p><p>out at last there was a good harvest, and, </p><p>after most of it had been sown for the next </p><p>year, he thought it would produce enough to </p><p>keep everybody. So he persuaded most of </p><p>the “wakers” to go to sleep too, until it </p><p>would be ready, so as to economize sup- </p><p>plies. That was how Mr. Raynor came to </p><p>go to sleep. He did not know if he would </p><p>wake, for the Chief Power was plotting </p><p>to depose the Power of the World, and if </p><p>she did, she was sure to kill most'of the </p><p>sleepers. </p><p> He had rescued me, and the “disobedi-</p><p>ences” for which she wished to kill him were </p><p>all 011 my account. There was a Chief </p><p>Physician, and he was a good man and had </p><p>helped him, and liked me. He was one </p><p>of those left awake. He said that he </p><p>meant to dance at my wedding with Mr. </p><p>Raynor. (The history made it quite plain </p><p>that Mr. Raynor was in love with me.) </p><p>He called me “pretty little 214,713, Lon- </p><p>don.” The sleepers had all been num- </p><p>bered, and I suppose the “wakers” had </p><p>been numbered first, because Mr. Raynor </p><p>was r84. </p><p>II </p><p> I DECIDED at once that-I would</p><p>jgf§§; try to find the Chief Physician. </p><p> The history said that he lived in the</p><p>building where we slept. (It was the War </p><p>Office.) </p><p> I opened the door and looked into a very</p><p>long corridor, paneled with brown wood. </p><p>It was quite empty. I lifted Mr. Raynor in </p><p>my arms and staggered out with him, and </p><p>went up-stairs. On the walls there were</p><p>printed plans of the floor. There were only </p><p>numbers on them, but one or two had been </p><p>written across in red ink, “Captain of </p><p>Guard,” and so on. On the top floor I </p><p>round “Chief Physician” marked on one. </p><p> I opened the door, and staggered in.</p><p>Mr. Raynor was big and heavy, and I am </p><p>only small. I was so exhausted that I fell; </p><p>and then I heard a voice—a kind voice that </p><p>did not frighten me. “ 2-1-4-7-1-3. London! </p><p>Good girl!” </p><p> “Water!” I begged. “Water!’1'</p><p>“I can’t move, my dear,” the voice said </p><p>£ wiped my eyes and looked up, and saw </p><p>a gentleman rather like my father, bound to </p><p>a chair; and I got up somehow and tried to </p><p>untie him. </p><p> “You’ll never do it with those little fin-</p><p>gers,” he said. “There’s a penknife in my </p><p>waistcoat pocket; left hand; my left; the </p><p>lower one. That’s right!” </p><p> I cut the knots and he got up and stag</p><p>gered about, stamping and shaking bimscii' </p><p>to get rid of his stiffness. He asked if 1 had </p><p>read the history, and I said yes; and he </p><p>told me what had happened afterward. </p><p> Mrs. Ashbury had gone to America, will;</p><p>a shipful of armed men, to try to kill the </p><p>Power of the World; but he had been pre- </p><p>pared, and had taken them by surprise as </p><p>they were landing, and defeated them. </p><p> So she and those who were left had come</p><p>back in another ship. She had broken away </p><p>from the other Governments, and those in </p><p>England who did not agree with her had fled </p><p>abroad, or had been killed, unless it was </p><p>a party in Lancashire, led by a “Suffragette </p><p>lady,” who had been one of the Powers </p><p>under Mrs. Ashbury, but would never agree </p><p>to harming the sleeper^. He did not know </p><p>her fate. Mrs. Ashbury and her followers </p><p>meant to wake only enough of the sleepers </p><p>to fight the wolves—and perhaps a few </p><p>women and children later—and to kill the </p><p>rest. He had refused to help in the slaugh- </p><p>338 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>ter, and they had to get another doctor to </p><p>help them. So they threatened to kill him </p><p>with the first batch that very night. </p><p> “I’m afraid they will, little one,” he said;</p><p>“and you, too. We might possibly get </p><p>away by ourselves; but not with—our </p><p>burden.” He shook his head at Mr. Ray- </p><p>nor, whom I had lifted on a couch. “I </p><p>don’t suggest your going alone,” he added, </p><p>“because-” </p><p> “ Because, if I would, I’m not worth sav-</p><p>ing,"I said. “No. Of course I wouldn’t leave </p><p>him; and you wouldn’t, because—he trusted </p><p>you; and I do. But can’t you wake him?” </p><p>“No; not till the three days are up. We </p><p>must try to save him till then.” </p><p> He considered for a long while with his</p><p>chin on his hand. </p><p>“I can think of only one way,” he told </p><p>me at last, “and I fear it requires courage </p><p>beyond your power, my brave little lady.” </p><p>“If there is only one way,” I said, “of </p><p>course I must try. What is it? ” </p><p> He did not answer my question at once,</p><p>but thought again, staring at me as if he </p><p>did not see mei </p><p>iBp “I WANT you to understand the </p><p>SPf situation,” he said. “It is fairer; </p><p> and, besides, you may see some</p><p>better plan. It would be possible to get </p><p>out of this building. There are guards at </p><p>the doors, but we could get through a </p><p>window on the ground floor. There are </p><p>thousands of empty houses where we </p><p>could hide, if we once got away and if we </p><p>escaped the wolves—and the human wolves, </p><p>the followers of the Chief Power. If you </p><p>and I were alone, there would be a chance; </p><p>a poor one, but I think our best. With our </p><p>friend here to carry, there would be no </p><p>chance at all of escaping so.” A howling </p><p>rose in the distance, and he took me to the </p><p>window looking down Whitehall to Big </p><p>Ben. “Lookl” he said; and I looked, and </p><p>clung to him. </p><p> A large party of armed men—about two</p><p>hundred—were coming from Parliament </p><p>Street in our direction. Innumerable wolves </p><p>—dogs of all kinds and sizes, and yet </p><p>changed from dogs—were following. Some- </p><p>times they approached so near that the men </p><p>faced round with fixed bayonets, or axes. </p><p>Sometimes a few ran by the side of the party </p><p>and snapped at men till they were stabbed; </p><p>and then the other wolves rushed upon </p><p>them and. devoured them. </p><p> “ They go in flocks,” he told me, “ but they</p><p>rush down all the streets in turn; and with </p><p>our friend to carry we could never get away </p><p>from them, or from the patrols. No, we </p><p>can’t escape that way.” </p><p> “What is your plan?” I asked.</p><p> “We might hide in chimneys, or under</p><p>the floors; but they would be sure to trace </p><p>us. It’s a poor plan.” </p><p> “Yes,” I agreed. “What zs your plan?”</p><p>He looked at me again for a long while. </p><p>Then he told me. </p><p> “That you should go back to your places,”</p><p>he said, “and let them think that they </p><p>kill you. They propose to do it by injecting </p><p>poison. If they have not changed its pre- </p><p>scription—you must risk that—I can inocu- </p><p>late you with an antidote. It will take </p><p>away all power to move, and a good deal of </p><p>your sensibility; not all. You will suffer— </p><p>suffer in body and in mind, my poor child, </p><p>but you will live. In a day or so you and </p><p>he will wake. You are both young and </p><p>active, and he is bold and resourceful. </p><p>They will probably give up watching the </p><p>dead. You may escape then—escape, I </p><p>hope, to a long and happy life together.” </p><p> “ And you? ” I asked. “ You, dear friend? ”</p><p>“Oh, well,” he said, “I had to die any- </p><p>how.” </p><p> “I will take no chance of safety that you</p><p>do not share! ” I declared. “He would not, </p><p>if he were alive—awake, I mean. I answer </p><p>for his honor. And he shall not wake to find </p><p>that I deserted you!” </p><p> “I shall go out and chance escaping the</p><p>wolves,” he stated. “You see, it would be </p><p>no use inoculating myself. When they </p><p>found me unbound and yet unconscious, </p><p>they might suspect my plan, and—and </p><p>make sure of me! Probably of you and of </p><p>him, too.” </p><p> “They shall not find you unbound,” 1</p><p>said. “I will bind you as I found you, and </p><p>inoculate you. Then I will inoculate him; </p><p>and then myself. And when I wake—if 1 </p><p>wake—I will come to you.” </p><p> “Ah, my dear!” he said. “You are</p><p>brave! But are you brave enough?” </p><p> “I have to be!” I said.</p><p> We ate and drank. Then we carried</p><p>Mr. Raynor back to his place, and the </p><p>Chief Physician inoculated him, showing me </p><p>how to do it. He marked the place on his </p><p>own flesh and mine when we went to his </p><p>room. He kissed my forehead. “The </p><p>good God strengthen you!” he prayed. </p><p>The Awakening </p><p>339 </p><p>Then he sat in his chair, and 1 bound him. </p><p>“If we live, I will be a daughter to you,” </p><p>I promised, ‘‘and he will be a son.” Then </p><p>I inoculated him. He went quickly into </p><p>a stupor. </p><p> "Hide—the syringe—before you—go—</p><p>too—numb,” he gasped faintly. Then he </p><p>said no more. Even his eyes did not move, </p><p>but they were open, and I believed that he </p><p>could still see and hear. </p><p> “I shall be brave,” I told him. “Do not</p><p>doubt me.”</p><p> I kissed his forehead, and went out into</p><p>the deathly stillness of the empty corridors, </p><p>and back to my place. I must have </p><p>screamed if I had not bitten my lips. </p><p> The good God must have given me</p><p>strength, as the Chief Physician said, for </p><p>I never faltered in my resolution. I wrote </p><p>on the history what had happened, so that </p><p>.Mr. Raynor might go and rescue the Chief </p><p>Physician if he woke and I did not. After </p><p>that 1 sat by him for a few moments, with </p><p>my arm round his neck, and my face </p><p>against his. </p><p> “I hardly know you,” I said, “but you</p><p>love me. And I love you. God help us, </p><p>dear!” </p><p> Then I lay down, covered myself with the</p><p>rug, dug the syringe into my flesh and </p><p>pumped in the antidote. I -only just suc- </p><p>ceeded in removing it, the numbness came </p><p>on so quickly. Then I lay waiting; mo- </p><p>tionless, unable to stir an eyelid or make </p><p>.. soiufd, and yet dimly conscious of every- </p><p>thing round me—more than dimly conscious </p><p>of fear. The light grew dimmer and dim- </p><p>mer. I heard the wolves howl four times </p><p>before I became unable to distinguish Mr. </p><p>Raynor’s iacc; once more, and then it was </p><p>quite dark. I heard them howl three times </p><p>more; and then the death-dealers came, </p><p>talking to one another unconcernedly, as if </p><p>they went about some routine task. </p><p> There were eight of them. Two women</p><p>and a man carried lanterns. Three men had </p><p>large syringes. A lad carried a pail of fluid </p><p>from which they replenished them. The </p><p>rcd-faced man watched. They went along </p><p>the room in pairs, one holding the lantern </p><p>while the other knelt by the sleeper and </p><p>made the injection—two strokes of the </p><p>piston with a pause between. One pair </p><p>came to Mr. Raynor and another to me at </p><p>the same time. 1 was too numb to feel </p><p>pain when the great syringe dug deeply into </p><p>my flesh, but it was well for me that I could </p><p>not scream. As it was, I made a faint </p><p>sound. </p><p> “Must have been near waking,” the in-</p><p>jector said, putting the rug over my shoul- </p><p>ders again. “Well, she’s safe for another </p><p>four months.” Evidently he had not been </p><p>told that he was administering anything but </p><p>the usual sleeping-injection. To the credit </p><p>of my countrymen and countrywomen I </p><p>would record that it is now clear that Mrs. </p><p>Ashbury deceived them about her inten- </p><p>tions, and that very few of them realized </p><p>that she intended to kill the sleeping world.</p><p> “Make him quite safe,” the red-haired</p><p>man commanded, nodding toward Mr. Ray- </p><p>nor. “He’s a dangerous man.” </p><p> “He’s had the usual dose,” the operator</p><p>answered. “The Chief Physician always </p><p>said that more *ras dangerous.” </p><p> The red-faced man made no comment,</p><p>and they passed on, finished their work, and </p><p>went out. The wolves howled right under </p><p>the window just then. Soon afterward I </p><p>went to sleep. I felt as if a weight were </p><p>crushing me; and I thought that perhaps the </p><p>antidote had failed. I did not seem to care </p><p>about myself—it would be good to be at </p><p>rest, I thought—only about Mr. Raynor and </p><p>the Chief Physician. </p><p>Ill </p><p>IN the early light I woke in great </p><p>pain. I remembered that the Chief </p><p>Physician had said that I should </p><p>suffer. I was glad that Mr. Raynor was </p><p>unconscious. I thought that if I woke fully </p><p>I should wake mad. Presently some men </p><p>came in, and I feared that I should go mad </p><p>in my stupor. </p><p> They dad not look at Mr. Raynor or me.</p><p>Some one called out “214,717” and “214,- </p><p>72s,” and they carried off two sleepers, both </p><p>big men. I suppose they were selected to </p><p>wake and fight the wolves. </p><p> “You can leave the doors open,” the</p><p>voice called. “The wolves won’t matter </p><p>now.” </p><p> Then I think I did go mad for a time.</p><p>I seemed to be struggling with a tempest of </p><p>pain and fright, till I became unconscious </p><p>once more. </p><p> I woke, still racked by sharp pains, to find</p><p>the gray-haired woman kneeling beside </p><p>I\Jr. Raynor. She was crying. I tried to </p><p>call to beg her to keep out the wolves, but no </p><p>sound would come. When she went, how- </p><p>34° </p><p>Adventure </p><p>ever, she closed the door. I forgot my </p><p>pains in my thankfulness that we were safe </p><p>from the wolves, and slipped back into </p><p>sleep. Sometimes I roused a Jit tie at a pang </p><p>of pain, or rather, after it. For I knew that </p><p>I had been hurt, rather than felt it. Some- </p><p>times I dreamed of green fields, and brooks, </p><p>and music. Sometimes I dreamed that </p><p>stones were being heaped and heaped on me. </p><p> The dawn of another day was beginning</p><p>when I became fully conscious again. The </p><p>pains - were not so violent, and presently </p><p>they left me almost entirely. I could not </p><p>hear Mr. Raynor breathe, but I thought</p><p>that he did. The others were still—quite </p><p>still. I could not speak, but I could move </p><p>my eyelids. I blinked and blinked. Pres- </p><p>ently I could move a little finger; then all </p><p>my fingers. Gradually the use of my limbs </p><p>returned, and I sat up, aching all over—not </p><p>violently, but with a kind of cramp, and </p><p>feeling as if I had just come to from “ gas ” at </p><p>the dentist’s. </p><p> Mr. Raynor was still “sleeping,” and the</p><p>Chief Physician had said that he would not </p><p>wake until some time after us. So I was </p><p>not worried on his account, after I had </p><p>ascertained that he really breathed—which </p><p>was the first thing I did. I was too weak to </p><p>lift him, and I thought that probably the </p><p>guards below were gone, and the wolves. </p><p>So I decided to go up-stairs alone and untie </p><p>our kind friend, if he still lived. In case I </p><p>should never return I wrote on the cover of </p><p>the history and put it beside Mr. Raynor: </p><p> I have gone for the Chief Physician. If I do not</p><p>return, I shall have died. If we live, I will do what </p><p>you wish. God bless you. 214,713, London. </p><p> Elsie Anderson.</p><p> The corridors were empty, but I felt sure</p><p>that I heard wolves upon the floors below, </p><p>so I ran as fast as my shaking legs would </p><p>carry me. I found the Chief Physician </p><p>alive and evidently coming to, but not able </p><p>to speak. I unbound him and rubbed his </p><p>hands and bathed his face. In about half </p><p>an hour he could just stand. Then I heard </p><p>a sound in the corridor. Pit-pat, pit-patt </p><p>I shut the door, and the wolf came and </p><p>scratched at it and whined and barked. It </p><p>went away and came again. At last the </p><p>Chief Physician stumbled to a cupboard </p><p>and got two axes and two revolvers. </p><p> “Take some for him,” I proposed; for, of</p><p>course, I knew that we should go down to </p><p>Air. Raynor at all risks. </p><p> “He won’t wake yet,” our friend assured</p><p>me. “It’s no use burdening ourselves. </p><p>We shall have to fight our way, I expect.” </p><p>He seemed quite cheerful at the prospect of </p><p>the struggle. “Use the ax when, you can, </p><p>and take the revolver in your left hand. </p><p>We’ll settle this one first. I’ll jam his head </p><p>in the door. Get ready!” </p><p> He opened the door a little. The wolf—</p><p>it had been a big bull terrier-forced its </p><p>head through the opening, and I brought </p><p>the ax down. </p><p> “That’s one!” said the Chief Physician.</p><p>“Come on!” And we went out. Strange </p><p>to say, I had no fear; I felt like a machine. </p><p> There were no other wolves on the two</p><p>upper floors, but some were coming up the </p><p>stairs from the second floor, where Mr. Ray- </p><p>nor was. They retreated before us, growl- </p><p>ing and snarling. About twenty waited at </p><p>the foot of the stairs. We had to reach </p><p>a door some twenty yards'along the corridor. </p><p>We shot three of the beasts, and the others </p><p>fell upon them; then we made a rush and </p><p>reached the room. One wolf tore my dress, </p><p>but the Chief Physician killed him. An- </p><p>other got half through the door after us and </p><p>caught the Chief Physician’s boot, but I </p><p>blew out its brains. </p><p> Mr. Raynor was breathing very faintly.</p><p>The Chief Physician listened to his heart </p><p>and felt his pulse. He shook his head sev- </p><p>eral times, and I gasped for breath. </p><p> “I do not know the exact effect of the</p><p>poison and the antidote on a sleeper,” he </p><p>said at last. “I hope he will wake, but— </p><p>I do not know. I have done my best, </p><p>Elsie.” </p><p> “ You have done your best,” I said, “ your</p><p>very best, dear friend. But if he does not </p><p>live I do not want to. Is there nothing you </p><p>can do? Nothing?” </p><p> “If I could get a stimulant from my</p><p>room,” he said, “it might help him. There </p><p>is nothing really wrong. It is a question </p><p>whether his heart is strong enough to out- </p><p>last the struggle between the poison and the </p><p>antidote. The heart beats more feebly in </p><p>the sleep, you see. Arc you brave enough </p><p>to be left? ” </p><p> “I am brave enough not to let you go</p><p>alone,” I answered. </p><p> We went to the door, and peeped out.</p><p>The wolves had gone. So we decided to </p><p>take Mr. Raynor up-stairs again, carrying </p><p>him between us. </p><p> We were half-way up the first stairs when</p><p>The Awakening </p><p>341 </p><p>we heard a terrific howling overhead, and the </p><p>shouts of men, and a few women. The </p><p>wolves had evidently gone up above; and </p><p>the “ wakers” had gone by another way and </p><p>were pursuing them in force. The fight for </p><p>which the Chief Power had awakened some </p><p>of the slumberers was beginning. Shots </p><p>were fired, and we heard the blows of axes; </p><p>the wolves seemed to be running along the </p><p>corridor to the stairs. </p><p> “Back to the rooml” the Chief Physician</p><p>cried. But as we reached the corridor the </p><p>voice of the Chief Power rose above the </p><p>others, and with one accord we fled down </p><p>the next staircase. For we thought that she</p><p>might come in the room to look again at </p><p>Mr. Raynor. We feared her more than all </p><p>the wolves. </p><p> We reached the main hall, breathless and</p><p>staggering with our burden; and then the </p><p>wolves overtook us. They were too terri- </p><p>fied to do any harm, but swept on like a </p><p>sea, knocking us down on the slippery tiled </p><p>floor and running over us. The pursuers </p><p>followed in the rear, smiting with their axes, </p><p>till the wolves were killed or had got </p><p>through the doorway, running over one an- </p><p>other, three, four, five high. Then we sat </p><p>up, and the guards formed between us and </p><p>the doorway, waiting for orders from the </p><p>gray-haired woman. </p><p> She stood at the foot of the white marble</p><p>stairs, with little streams of red blood run- </p><p>ning down them, and faced us. She was </p><p>motionless, like the statue of some evil </p><p>deity. Mr. Raynor opened his eyes and </p><p>moved his lips. The Chief Physician and I </p><p>knelt, holding him between us. He smiled </p><p>faintly at me, and I smiled at him, putting </p><p>my arm round him and drawing him against </p><p>me. </p><p> “We live for a moment together,” I whis-</p><p>pered; “and perhaps—afterward.” For </p><p>I saw in her eyes that she would kill us. </p><p> There was a long silencc, and all waited</p><p>with their eyes on her. </p><p> She moved her lips silently before she</p><p>spoke. She addressed the Chief Physician. </p><p> “ Traitor! ” she said in a clear, stem voice.</p><p>“Traitor to us all! ” She turned to the rest. </p><p>“He cabled to Abrahams!” she told them, </p><p>and there was a fierce murmur. </p><p> “Yes,” the Chief Physician told her. “I</p><p>cabled to the Power of the World—your </p><p>master and mine. It is you who are the </p><p>traitor—traitor and murderess!” </p><p> “Your Power of the World has not come,”</p><p>she taunted him. “He does not govern. </p><p>England, and you are a traitor to your </p><p>country.” </p><p> “You are &amp; traitor to mankind!” he</p><p>answered. “ He mil come, and then he will </p><p>kill you!” </p><p> “And now,” she said very quietly, “I will</p><p>kill you.” </p><p> “ I expected nothing else,” be said. “ But,</p><p>if there is a spark of womanhood or human- </p><p>ity in you-” He was going to ask her </p><p>to spare us, but she cut him short. </p><p> “There is none,” she said, “for traitors!</p><p>Kill them!” </p><p> The crowd advanced upon us, but she</p><p>made a quick motion with her hand. “Take</p><p>them outside,” she commanded, passing her </p><p>hands over her eyes. She sank on the mar- </p><p>ble steps with her dress dabbling in the </p><p>blood, and the men seized us and dragged </p><p>us through the doors. Our arms were </p><p>round one another, and they did not sepa- </p><p>rate us. </p><p> “All in vain,” the Chief Physician mut-</p><p>tered; “your courage; and yours!” </p><p> “And yours,” said Mr. Raynor, “old</p><p>friend!” </p><p> “No,” I said. “Not in vain, not in vain,</p><p>my dears! There will be an awakening!” </p><p>And I kissed my lover and my friend, and </p><p>they kissed me. </p><p>IV </p><p>AND then we passed through die </p><p>doorway, and the wolves rushed </p><p>upon us like a stormy sea. There </p><p>were thousands of them—tens and tens of </p><p>thousands, wolves that had once been dogs, </p><p>all kinds, all sizes. They covered the wide </p><p>road and more, for they ran on top of one an- </p><p>other. They came from both directions, </p><p>and from each way a great army of men and </p><p>women pursued them in serried ranks, axes </p><p>in hand—axes dripping red. </p><p> The guards dropped us and ran within the</p><p>doors. The wolves knocked us down, as </p><p>before, and swarmed over us; swarmed in </p><p>heaps that crushed us and almost stifled us; </p><p>rose like a great wave to the top of the door- </p><p>way and fell in, one wave after another. </p><p> I caught a glimpse of the marble stairway,</p><p>and wolves were pouring down that, spring- </p><p>ing at the throa ts of those who tried to pass </p><p>up it. I saw the gray-haired woman fall </p><p>with a dozen holding her. Shrieks and </p><p>shrieks and shrieks came from inside. </p><p>342 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Outside, the men and women, coming</p><p>both from Charing Cross and from West- </p><p>minster, slew and slew. Every now and </p><p>then a rush of the wolves—those that were </p><p>not driven into th.e building or killed—swept </p><p>them off their legs. The men and women </p><p>closed up again and still slaughtered. I can </p><p>see one little fair-haired woman now, smit- </p><p>ing and smiting and smiting. She was a </p><p>mistress from my old school, and she had </p><p>always been such a gentle little thing; but </p><p>the wolves had killed her child. </p><p> They killed the heap on top of us, throw-</p><p>ing them aside as they slew them and smit- </p><p>ing the next. We rose red with the slaugh- </p><p>ter, and a man, also red, held out his hand </p><p>to the Chief Physician—a stout, panting,</p><p>disheveled old Jew man, who seemed to be </p><p>directing everybody. </p><p> “You are the Chief Physician,” he said,</p><p>“ aren’t you? They showed me your photo. </p><p>I am Abrahams; I came at your call.” </p><p> They stood there, forgetting every one but</p><p>themselves, and talked, while the others </p><p>went into the War Office to finish the last of </p><p>the wolves. They would have slain the </p><p>human wolves, too, I. think, if any had </p><p>been -left; but there were none. They </p><p>knew the Chief Power only by her dress. </p><p> The Power of the World told how he had</p><p>come with a handful of men, at the Chief </p><p>Physician’s summons. If England did not </p><p>rise to support him he must die, he knew. </p><p>“ We run that risk every day,” he said, “and </p><p>I believed in England.” His belief had </p><p>been justified The people had gone over to </p><p>him everywhere, as soon as they knew what </p><p>Mrs. Ashbury intended; and though hun- </p><p>dreds of thousands of sleepers had been </p><p>poisoned under her orders—her tools mostly </p><p>believing that they were merely using the </p><p>sleeping injection—he had been in time to </p><p>stop most of the slaughter. </p><p> About thirty thousand of the first batch</p><p>of sleepers had already roused and joined </p><p>him. He was clearing away the wolves and </p><p>seeking Mrs. Ashbury and the remains of </p><p>her Government—who, it seemed, had not </p><p>heard of his arrival—“to clear them away, </p><p>too.” But their fellow-wolves had done it </p><p>for him. </p><p> “We are saved,” he declared, “if we can</p><p>get through the next few days. We have </p><p>to draft the people to their homes without </p><p>losing trace of them, and to get the food sup- </p><p>plies distributed to them. We must work, </p><p>work, work! Nothing like work!” said the </p><p>stout, disheveled, big old Jew man, who </p><p>looked like a butcher. I had expected </p><p>a noble patriarch, and I felt disappointed in </p><p>him—then. Now I know that he is greater </p><p>than all the rest. </p><p> Mr. Raynor and I had said little all the</p><p>time, only held hands tightly and looked </p><p>into each other’s eyes. </p><p> “You are mine,” he said. “Dear—I dc</p><p>not know your name, but you are mine.” </p><p> “It is Elsie,” I told him. “Yes, I am</p><p>yours.” </p><p> And then the Chief Physician touched tbe</p><p>arm of the Power of the World. </p><p> “Here are two of our best.” he said.</p><p>“They will work.” </p><p> The Power of the World held out his</p><p>hands to us, and smiled; and then he seemed</p><p>no longer an old Jew, and something more </p><p>than a man. </p><p> “You are doing the best work in the</p><p>world,” he told us; "just loving! Never </p><p>leave off, my dears!” </p><p> That was his text and the battle-cry that</p><p>led us through the struggle of the next fort- </p><p>night. “For the love of those who sleep!” </p><p>he urged, when some grumbled at our priva- </p><p>tions. “ For the love of those who suffered </p><p>to save you!” he told those who woke, when </p><p>their weakened bodies halted at their labors </p><p>—for we worked till we dropped in those </p><p>days. “For the love of your old leader!" </p><p>he pleaded, when even we who were round </p><p>him thought his counsels too hard. </p><p> His last words as Power of the World— i»</p><p>the speech by which he restored the old </p><p>rulers and resigned all power and place— </p><p>were the same. </p><p> “The best work in the world,” be said,</p><p>“ is the work thatall can do—just to love one </p><p>another. I have done only that. But if you </p><p>think you owe anything to me, who owe </p><p>everything to my faithful followers; if you </p><p>think that the waking of the world is due in </p><p>any part to my efforts, make it a world of </p><p>love and good-fellowship—a world that was </p><p>worth making! </p><p> And so, because ail the world loved him.</p><p>every country all over the earth passed one </p><p>great law of peace and fellowship and good- </p><p>will; and, to mark the fact that the days of </p><p>war and strife were over, the calendar of the </p><p>years was started afresh; and I, Elsie Ray- </p><p>nor, formerly Anderson, wife of George </p><p>Raynor, Secretary of the Traffic Reorganiza- </p><p>tion Board, write this account in Year One </p><p>of the Awakening. </p><p>THE EMERALD BUDDHA </p><p>BY FREDERICK ARNOLD HUMMER* </p><p>CHAPTER I </p><p>MR. ASHTON </p><p> )HE dull October afternoon was</p><p>rapidly drawing to a dose as I </p><p>passed through the village of </p><p>Pinhoe and set my steps rather </p><p>wearily toward Exeter. I had conceived </p><p>the idea, some time before, of walking from </p><p>London to Torquay, and my chief concern </p><p>at the moment was to decide whether or not </p><p>I could cover the intervening five miles and </p><p>reach the Half Moon Hotel in High Street </p><p>before the impending storm broke. </p><p> I had left Pinhoe perhaps half a mile to</p><p>the rear, when the strong southwest gale </p><p>whipped into my face some drops of cold, </p><p>stinging rain. As I hesitated, uncertain</p><p>whether to go forward in the face of the </p><p>gale or to beat a hasty retreat to the vil- </p><p>lage, I heard behind me the sound of an </p><p>approaching automobile. </p><p> It slowed up, and a voice inquired whether</p><p>I could point out the way to Major Tem- </p><p>ple’s place. I glanced up and saw a tall, </p><p>heavily built man of perhaps some forty </p><p>years of age, bronzed and rugged, with the </p><p>mark of the traveler upon him, and al- </p><p>though his face at first impressed me un- </p><p>pleasantly, the impression was dispelled in </p><p>part at least by his peculiarly attractive </p><p>smile. I informed him that I was myself a </p><p>comparative stranger to that part of Eng- </p><p>land. He then asked if I were going toward </p><p>Exeter and, on my affirmative reply, at </p><p>once invited me to get into the car, as he </p><p>could carry me at least the major part of </p><p>my way. </p><p> He was a good looking fellow, of a sort,</p><p>with a somewhat sensuous face, and I fell </p><p>certain that his short, stubby, black mus- </p><p>tache concealed a rather cruel mouth. Evi- </p><p>dently a man to gain his ends, I thought, </p><p>without being over nice about the means he </p><p>employed. </p><p>343 </p><p>344 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Presently he turned to me. "I under-</p><p>stand,’' he said, “ that Major Temple’s place </p><p>is upon the main road, about half a mile </p><p>this side of Exeter. There is a gray stone </p><p>gateway, and a lodge. I shall try the first </p><p>entrance answering that description.” </p><p> I suggested that I should leave the car as</p><p>toon as we reached the gateway in question </p><p>and continue upon foot the balance of my </p><p>way. My companion nodded and we rode </p><p>in silence for a few moments. Suddenly, </p><p>with a great swirl of dead leaves and a </p><p>squall of cold rain, the storm broke upon us, </p><p>and a moment later we turned without </p><p>stopping into a handsome gray stone gate- </p><p>way and up a long, straight gravel road </p><p>bordered on each side by a row of beautiful </p><p>oaks. I glanced up in some surprise, but he </p><p>only smiled and nodded, so I said no more, </p><p>realizing that be could hardly set me down </p><p>in the face of such a storm. </p><p> A quarter of a mile, through a fine park,</p><p>and a swift turn brought us up under the </p><p>porte-coch&amp;rc of a large gray stone house of </p><p>«! peculiar and to me somewhat gloomy and </p><p>unattractive appearance. The rain and </p><p>wind were now so bad that I saw it would </p><p>be useless to attempt to proceed against it,</p><p>and after a short wait the door was thrown </p><p>open bv a servant and we hurriedly entered. </p><p>WE FOUND ourselves in a large, </p><p>dimly lighted hallway. I in- </p><p>spected with considerable curios- </p><p>ity the man who had admitted us, not only </p><p>because of his Oriental appearance—he was a </p><p>Chinaman of the better sort—but also be- </p><p>cause he was dressed in his native garb. He, </p><p>upon his part, showed not the slightest in- </p><p>terest in our coming, as he inspected us with </p><p>his childlike, sleepy eyes. </p><p> “Tell Major Temple,” said my friend,</p><p>“that Mr. Robert Ashton is here, and—” </p><p>he turned to me with a questioning glance— </p><p>“Owen Morgan,” I replied, wondering if </p><p>he would know me by name. If he did, he </p><p>showed no sign. </p><p> “Just so—Mr. Owen Morgan,” he con-</p><p>tinued, then strode toward a log fire which </p><p>crackled and sputtered cheerily upon the </p><p>hearth of a huge stone fire-place. </p><p> “I’m afraid I’m rather presuming upon</p><p>the situation,” I suggested when I had </p><p>joined him, “but perhaps the storm will </p><p>slacken up presently.’’ </p><p>Major Temple will be glad to see you, </p><p>I’m sure,” rejoined Mr. Ashton uncon- </p><p>cernedly, “You can’t possibly go on, you </p><p>know.” </p><p> “I’m afraid not,” I answered, a bit un-</p><p>graciously. </p><p> “The Major is a queer oid character,”</p><p>Mr. Ashton remarked. “Great traveler </p><p>and collector. I’m here on a matter of busi- </p><p>ness myself—partly, at least. He’ll be </p><p>glad to meet you. I fancy he’s a bit lonely </p><p>with nobody to keep him company but his </p><p>daughter. Here he comes now.” </p><p> He turned toward a tall spare man with</p><p>gray hair and drooping gray mustaches. </p><p>His face, like Ashton’s, had the dull bumt- </p><p>in tone of brown which is acquired only by </p><p>long exposure to the sun and which usually </p><p>marks its possessor as a traveler in the hot </p><p>countries. </p><p> “Ah, Ashton,” exclaimed the Major,</p><p>dropping his monocle, “delighted to sec </p><p>you. You arrived yesterday?” </p><p> “Late yesterday; you see I lost no time</p><p>in coming to report the result of my quest.” </p><p> “And you were successful?” demanded</p><p>the older man excitedly. </p><p> “Entirely so,” replied Ashton, with a</p><p>smile of satisfaction. </p><p> “Good! Good!” The Major rubbed his</p><p>hands and smiled, then, apparently ob- </p><p>serving me for the first time, glanced at</p><p>Mr. Ashton with a slight frown and an in- </p><p>terrogative expression. </p><p> “ Mr. Owen Morgan,” said Ashton iightly,</p><p>“on his way to Exeter with me. I took </p><p>the liberty of bringing him in, on aceouni </p><p>of the storm.” </p><p> “I am ready to go on at once,” I inter-</p><p>jected stiffly, “as soon as the rain lets up </p><p>a bit.” </p><p> “Nonsense, nonsenseS” The Major’s</p><p>voice was somewhat testy. “You can’t, </p><p>possibly proceed on a night like this. </p><p>Make yourself at home, sir. Any friend of </p><p>Mr. Ashton’s is welcome here.” He turned </p><p>to one of the servants, who had entered the </p><p>room'to turn on the lights. “Show Mr. </p><p>Ashton and Mr. Morgan to their rooms, </p><p>Gibson. You’ll be wanting to fix up a bit </p><p>before dinner,” he announced. </p><p> “Which rooms, sir, shall I show the gen-</p><p>tlemen to?” asked the man, a trifle un- </p><p>easily, I thought. </p><p> The Major looked at Ashton and laughed.</p><p>“Ashton,” be said, “you know I took this </p><p>place only a short time ago on my return </p><p>from my last trip to the East and, as we do </p><p>not have many visitors, it’s a bit musty and </p><p>The Emerald Buddha </p><p>345 </p><p>out of shape. Queer old house, I fancy. </p><p>Supposed to be haunted or something of the </p><p>sort. I imagine it won’t worry you much.” </p><p>“Hardly,” replied my companion. “I’ve </p><p>outgrown ghosts. Lead on to the haunted </p><p>chamber.” </p><p> The Major turned to the servant. “ Show</p><p>the gentlemen to the two rooms in the west </p><p>wing, Gibson—the green room will suit </p><p>Mr. Ashton, I fancy, and perhaps Mr. </p><p>Morgan will find the white-and-gold room </p><p>across the hall comfortable for the night.” </p><p>I found my room a large and fairly com- </p><p>fortable one, and busied myself in making </p><p>such preparations for dinner as I could </p><p>with the few requisites my small knapsack </p><p>contained. </p><p>AFTER a considerable time I heard </p><p>the musical notes of a Chinese gong </p><p>and, making my way to the stair- </p><p>case, I saw Ashton just joining a strikingly </p><p>beautiful and distinguished looking girl of </p><p>perhaps twenty-two or -three, dressed in an </p><p>evening gown of white, the very simplicity </p><p>of which only served to accentuate the </p><p>splendid lines of her figure. With her </p><p>splendid eyes and wide brow, crowned with </p><p>a mass of bronze-colored hair, I felt that </p><p>even my critical artistic taste could with</p><p>difficulty find a flaw. It was evident that </p><p>she and Mr. Ashton knew each other well, </p><p>yet it seemed to me that Miss Temple did </p><p>not respond with much cordiality to his </p><p>^ffysive greeting. </p><p> As I joined them, Major Temple pre-</p><p>sented me as a friend of Mr. Ashton’s, </p><p>which, it appeared to me, did not predispose </p><p>that young lady particularly in my favor. </p><p>CHAPTER H </p><p>AN APPEAL FOR HELP </p><p>DURING dinner the two men talked </p><p>continually of China, and referred fre- </p><p>quently to “it,” and to “the stone.” I at- </p><p>tempted to carry on a conversation with </p><p>Miss Temple, but she seemed laboring under </p><p>intense excitement and unable to give my </p><p>efforts any real attention. As near as I </p><p>could gather, Ashton had set out from Hong </p><p>Kong some months before on a search for </p><p>a certain stone or jewel which Major Temple </p><p>desired for his collection, and after an adven- </p><p>turous trip, during which he had been forced </p><p>at the risk of his life to remain disguised as </p><p>a coolie for some weeks, had finally escaped </p><p>and returned to England. </p><p> There was also some talk of a reward,</p><p>which seemed to give Mr. Ashton great sat- </p><p>isfaction and to cause Major Temple much </p><p>uneasiness, for I saw him glance frequently </p><p>at the blanched face of his daughter. </p><p> As Mr. Ashton brought his thrilling story</p><p>to a conclusion he drew from his waistcoat </p><p>pocket a small, green, leather case, evi- </p><p>dently of Chinese workmanship, and turned </p><p>out upon the white cloth a miniature repre- </p><p>sentation of the god Buddha, above an inch </p><p>and a half in height and wonderfully cut </p><p>from a single flawless emerald! </p><p> As the wonderful, sparkling gem flashed</p><p>across the white cloth in the direction of </p><p>Miss Temple an expression of intense horror </p><p>passed over her face as she caught the burn- </p><p>ing eyes of Mr. Ashton fixed upon hers. </p><p>She returned his gaze defiantly for a mo- </p><p>ment, then lowered her eyes and composed </p><p>her features behind the cold and impassive </p><p>mask she had worn throughout the evening. </p><p> Ashton flushed a sullen red, then picked</p><p>up the jewel and set it carelessly upon the </p><p>top of a cut-glass salt-cellar and I was </p><p>startled to see the wooden, impassive face of </p><p>the Chinese servant light up with a glare of </p><p>sudden anger and alarm as he caught sight </p><p>.of the jewel. Major Temple, observing </p><p>him at the same moment, quickly covered </p><p>the figure with his hand, and the Chinaman, </p><p>resuming almost instantly his customary</p><p>look of childlike unconcern, proceeded to </p><p>offer us cigars and cigarettes as Miss Temple </p><p>rose and left the table. I excused myself, </p><p>feeling superfluous, and strolled into the </p><p>great hall, where I stood with my back to the </p><p>welcome fire, listening to the howling of the </p><p>storm withbut. </p><p> Perhaps fifteen minutes later Miss Tem-</p><p>ple came quickly into the hall, the beauty of </p><p>her delicate, mobile face marred by evident </p><p>mental suffering. </p><p> “You are a friend of Mr. Ashton’s,” she</p><p>said, as she came up to me. “Have you </p><p>known him long? ” </p><p> “Miss Temple, I am afraid I can hardly</p><p>claim to be a friend of Mr. Ashton’s. </p><p>I never met him before this afternoon.” </p><p> “But I thought you came with him?"</p><p>she said. </p><p> I explained my presence, and mentioned</p><p>my work. </p><p> “Then you are Owen Morgan, the illus-</p><p>trator!” she cried. “I know your work </p><p>346 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>very well, and I am delighted tQ meet-you. </p><p>I was afraid you, too, were in the conspir- </p><p>acy.” Her face darkened again, </p><p> “The conspiracy?” I asked, much mysti-</p><p>fied. </p><p> Miss Temple looked apprehensively to-</p><p>ward the door, then her eyes sought mine, </p><p>“I am all alone here, Mr. Morgan,” she </p><p>said at last, “and 1 need a friend very </p><p>badly. I wonder if I can depend upon you </p><p>—trust you? ” </p><p> I was surprised, but assured her I should</p><p>be only too happy to serve her in any </p><p>way. </p><p> “But what is it that you fear?” I in-</p><p>quired. </p><p> “My father,” she said hurriedly, at</p><p>the same time lowering her voice, “is a </p><p>madman on the subject of jewels. He </p><p>would give anything—anything to pos- </p><p>sess some curio upon which he had set his </p><p>desires! Last year, in China, he saw by </p><p>accident the emerald you have just seen. </p><p>It was the sacred reh'c of a Buddhist temple </p><p>in Ping Yang, and is said to have come from </p><p>the holy city of Lhasa in Thibet. His offers </p><p>to purchase it were laughed at, and when he </p><p>persisted he was forced to leave the city to </p><p>avoid trouble. </p><p> “In Hong Kong he made the acquaint-</p><p>ance of this man Ashton, a sort of agent and </p><p>collector. Mr. Ashton persecuted me with </p><p>his attentions in spite of my repeated re-</p><p>fusals to marry him. Imagine my amaze- </p><p>ment, then, when my father, on our arrival </p><p>in Englaixd, told me that he had commis- </p><p>sioned Mr. Ashton to obtain the Emerald </p><p>Buddha for him, and had agreed, in the </p><p>event of his success, to give him my hand in </p><p>marriage! </p><p> “My prayers, my appeals, were all</p><p>equally useless; he informed me that Mr. </p><p>Ashton was a gentleman—that he had given </p><p>him his word and could not break it. I was </p><p>forced into a semi-acquiescence to the ar- </p><p>rangement, believing that Mr. Ashton could </p><p>never succeed in his mad attempt, when </p><p>suddenly my father received word that </p><p>Mr. Ashton had arrived at Southampton </p><p>yesterday. I shall never marry Robert </p><p>Ashton—never! I do not know what my </p><p>father will ask of me, but if he asks that, </p><p>I shall leave this house to-morrow, and I beg </p><p>that you will take me with you, until I can </p><p>find some occupation that will enable me tc </p><p>support myself!” </p><p> Her story filled me with the deepest</p><p>astonishment. 1 thrust out jny hand and </p><p>grasped hers. “You can depend upon me </p><p>absolutely!” I exclaimed. “My mother is </p><p>at Torquay. She will be glad to welcome </p><p>you, Miss Temple.” </p><p> “Thank you, thank you!” she cried in her</p><p>deep, earnest voice. “ Do not leave in the </p><p>morning until I have seen you. Good- </p><p>night.” </p><p> At the stairway she threw back a smile of</p><p>such sweet gratitude and relief that I felt </p><p>amply repaid for my promise. </p><p>SUDDENLY my attention was at- </p><p>tracted by the sound of loud voices </p><p>coming from the direction of the </p><p>dining-room, as though Major Temple and </p><p>his guest were engaged in a violent quarrel. </p><p>Then Mr. Ashton burst into the hall, fol- </p><p>lowed by Major Temple, both of them ex- </p><p>cited and angry. </p><p> “I hold you to your contract!” the</p><p>former shouted. “By--, you’ll live up </p><p>to it, or I’ll know the reason why!” </p><p> “I’ll pay,-it, I’ll pay!” cried Major</p><p>Temple angrily.. “But not a penny to </p><p>boot!” </p><p> Ashton turned and faced him. “Don’t</p><p>you realize that that emerald is worth a </p><p>hundred thousand pounds? You promised </p><p>me your daughter, but you’ve got to pay </p><p>me for the stone in addition 1” </p><p> “Not a penny!” cried Major Tempie.</p><p> “Then I’ll take it to London and let</p><p>Crothers have it! ”</p><p> “ Come now, Ashton, what did the stone</p><p>cost you? Merely the cost of the trip, </p><p>wasn’t it? I’ll pay that, if you like.” </p><p> “And I risked my life a dozen times to</p><p>get you the jewel! You must be mad! </p><p>Fifty thousand pounds, and not a penny </p><p>less; </p><p> “It’s mine—1 told you of it! Without</p><p>my help you could have done nothing. </p><p>I demand it. It is my property. You were </p><p>acting only as my agent. Give it to me!” </p><p>Major Temple was beside himself with ex- </p><p>citement. </p><p> “I’ll see you- first,” cried Ashton,</p><p>now thoroughly angry. </p><p> The Major glared at him, pale with fur).</p><p>“I’ll never let you leave the house with </p><p>it!” he cried. </p><p> By this time my repeated coughing and</p><p>shuffling of my feet had attracted their at- </p><p>tention, and they both hastened to conceal </p><p>their anger. </p><p>The Emerald Buddha </p><p>347 </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>A CRY IN THE MORNING </p><p>IT SEEMED to me that I was disturbed, </p><p>during the night, by the sound of voices </p><p>without my door and the movements of </p><p>people in the hallway, but I presume it </p><p>was merely a dream. Just before day- </p><p>break, however, I got up to close one of </p><p>the windows, when I heard from the room </p><p>across the hall, the one occupied by Mr. </p><p>Ashton, a sudden and terrible cry as of </p><p>some one in mortal agony, followed by the </p><p>sound of a heavy body falling upon the </p><p>floor. I also fancied I heard the quick </p><p>closing of a door or window, but of this I </p><p>could not be sure. </p><p> I hastily threw on some clothes and ran</p><p>into the hall, calling loudly for help. Op- </p><p>posite me was the door of Mr. Ashton’s </p><p>room; I found it locked. Presently Major </p><p>Temple came running through the hallway, </p><p>followed by his daughter and several of the </p><p>servants. Miss Temple had thrown on a </p><p>long silk Chinese wrapper and I could not </p><p>help observing the ghastly pallor of her </p><p>face. </p><p> “What’s wrong here?” cried Major</p><p>Temple excitedly. </p><p> “I do not know, sir,” I replied. “I</p><p>heard a cry from Mr. Ashton’s room, but </p><p>I find his door locked.” </p><p>“Break it ini” cried Major Temple. </p><p> ATier several attempts the fastening gave</p><p>way and we were precipitated headlong</p><p>into the room. The gruesome sight before </p><p>us caused both Major Temple and myself </p><p>to recoil sharply toward the doorway. </p><p>Upon the floor lay Robert Ashton in his </p><p>night-clothes, his head in a pool of blood, </p><p>his hands outstretched before him, his face </p><p>ghastly with terror! </p><p> The Major at once ordered the servants</p><p>to keep out of the room, then turned to his </p><p>daughter and in a low voice requested her </p><p>to retire. She did so at once, in a state of </p><p>terrible excitement. He then closed the </p><p>door behind us, lighting the gas, and we </p><p>proceeded to examine the body. Ashton </p><p>was dead, although death had apparently </p><p>occurred but a short time before. In the </p><p>top of his head we found a deep circular </p><p>wound apparently made by some heavy, </p><p>sharp-pointed instrument, but there were </p><p>no other marks of violence. I examined </p><p>the wound in the head carefully, but could </p><p>not imagine any weapon which would </p><p>have left such a mark. </p><p> And then the wonder of the situation</p><p>began to dawn upon me. All three win- </p><p>dows were securely fastened with heavy </p><p>bolts on the inside. There was absolutely </p><p>no other means of entrance except the door, </p><p>and a rapid examination of its broken fasten- </p><p>ings showed it had been bolted upon the </p><p>inside. Major Temple was engaged in </p><p>searching Mr. Ashton’s Gladstone bag, </p><p>heedless of the grim and silent figure upon </p><p>the floor beside him, and, when he had con- </p><p>cluded, bent over the prostrate form of the </p><p>dead man and began a hurried search of his </p><p>person and the surrounding floor, “The </p><p>police must never find it!” I heard him </p><p>mutter. Then with a sudden cry he dashed </p><p>at a table on which lay the small green </p><p>leather case from which Ashton had pro- </p><p>duced the emerald at dinner the night before. </p><p>The case was empty. “ It’s gone! ” he fairly </p><p>screamed. “My-, it’s gone!” </p><p> “Impossible,” I said. “No one could</p><p>have entered or left this room since Mr. </p><p>Ashton came into it.” </p><p> “Nonsense!” Major Temple snorted ang-</p><p>rily. “Do you suppose Ashton smashed in </p><p>his own skull by way of amusement? ” He </p><p>turned to the bed and began to search it </p><p>closely, removing the pillows, feeling beneath </p><p>the mattresses, even taking the candle and </p><p>examining the floor foot by foot. Once </p><p>more he went over the contents of the port- </p><p>manteau, then again examined the clothing </p><p>of the dead man, but all to no purpose. The </p><p>Emerald Buddha was as clearly and evi-</p><p>dently gone as though it had vanished into </p><p>the surrounding ether. </p><p>THERE was clearly no possibility </p><p>that Ashton had inflicted this wound </p><p>upon himself, yet the supposition </p><p>that some one had entered the room from </p><p>without seemed nullified by the bolted door </p><p>and windows. </p><p> The body lay, its head toward the win-</p><p>dow in the west wall of the room, and some </p><p>six or eight feet away, and an even greater </p><p>distance from the walls on either side. </p><p>There was no piece of furniture, no heavy </p><p>object, anywhere near at hand. I looked </p><p>again at the queer, round, conical hole in the </p><p>top of the dead man’s head. It had evi- </p><p>dently been delivered from above. I glanced </p><p>up, and saw only the dim, unbroken expanse </p><p>of the ceiling above me papered in white. I </p><p>34« </p><p>Adventure </p><p>•turned to Major Temple, who stood staring </p><p>with protruding eyes at something upon the </p><p>floor near one of the windows. “What do </p><p>you make of that?” he asked in a startled </p><p>voice, handing me what appeared to be a </p><p>small piece of tough Chinese paper. Upon </p><p>it was inscribed, in black, a single Chinese </p><p>letter. </p><p> “It is the symbol of the god,” he said,</p><p>“ the Buddha! The same sign was engraved </p><p>upon the base of the emerald figure, and I </p><p>saw it in the temple at Ping Yang! What is </p><p>it doing here? ” Then his face lit up with a </p><p>sudden idea. He rushed to the door and </p><p>opened it. “ Gibson! ” he called to his man </p><p>without, “Find Li Min and bring him </p><p>here at once! Don’t let him out of your </p><p>sight for a moment!” </p><p> The man was gone ten minute's or more,</p><p>during which time Major Temple walked </p><p>excitedly up and down the room, muttering </p><p>continually something about the police. </p><p>“They must be notified,” I said, at last. He </p><p>turned to me with a queer, half frightened </p><p>look. “They can do no good, no good, </p><p>whatever!” he cried. “This is the work of </p><p>one of Ihe Chinese secret societies. They </p><p>are the cleverest criminals in the world. I </p><p>have lived among them, and I know.” </p><p> “ Even the cleverest criminals in the world</p><p>couldn’t bolt a door or window from the out- </p><p>side,” I said. </p><p> “Do not be too sure of that. I have</p><p>known them to do things equally strange. </p><p>This fellow Li Min 1 brought from China </p><p>with me—one of the most faithful servants </p><p>I have ever known. He is not of the peas-</p><p>ant or coolie class. He represented to me </p><p>that he was suspected of belonging to the </p><p>Reform Association, and was obliged to </p><p>leave the country to save his head. 1 do </p><p>not know—I do not know—possibly he may </p><p>have been sent to watch—they knew in </p><p>Ping Yang that I was after the Emerald </p><p>Buddha. Who knows? They are an amaz- </p><p>ing people, an amazing people! Did you </p><p>bear any footsteps or other noises in the </p><p>hallway during the night?” </p><p> I told him I could not be sure. At this</p><p>moment Gibson returned with a scared look </p><p>on his face. Li Min had disappeared. No </p><p>one had seen him since the night before. </p><p>His room had apparently been occupied, but </p><p>the Chinaman was nowhere to be found. </p><p> “The police must be notified at once,”</p><p>I urged. </p><p> “I will attend to it,” said the Major.</p><p>“First we must have, tome coffee.” He </p><p>closed the door of the room carefully and, </p><p>taking the key from the lock—it had evi- </p><p>dently not been used by Mr. Ashton the </p><p>night before—locked the door from the out- </p><p>side and ordered Gibson to remain in the </p><p>hallway without and allow ao one to </p><p>approach. </p><p> We finished dressing and. then had a hur-</p><p>ried breakfast. I suggested that I drive into </p><p>Exeter with one of his men, notify the police </p><p>and at the same time get my luggage., The </p><p>murder and the necessity of my appearing </p><p>as a witness at the inquest ;nade_it impera- </p><p>tive that I remain upon the scene untu the </p><p>police were satisfied. At my mentian of the </p><p>police the Major showed great uneasiness, </p><p>as before. “You need not say anything </p><p>about the—the emerald,” he said slowly. </p><p>“It will only create unnecessary talk and </p><p>trouble.” </p><p> “I’m afraid I must,” I replied. “It is</p><p>evidently the sole motive for the murder.” </p><p> He shook his head slowly. “What</p><p>a pity!” he remarked. ''‘-JTiat a pity! If </p><p>the stone is ever found now, the authorities </p><p>will hold it as the property of the dead man </p><p>or his relations, if indeed he has any. And </p><p>it would have been the crowning glory of </p><p>my collection! But they will never find it, </p><p>never!” he concluded with a cunning smile. </p><p> I wondered whether Major Temple knew</p><p>more than appeared on the surface, but </p><p>recollected his excited search of the dead </p><p>man’s belongings. </p><p>HOWEVER, during my short drive </p><p>to Exeter, the thought came to me </p><p>that if Major Temple could in any</p><p>way have caused the death of Robert Ash- </p><p>r.on from without the room, his first act aftej </p><p>sntering it would naturally have been to </p><p>search for the emerald. I regretted that </p><p>I had not examined the floor of the attic </p><p>above, to determine whether any carefully </p><p>fitted trap-door or hidden chimney or other </p><p>opening to the interior of the room below- </p><p>existed; also the walls, and the ground out- </p><p>side. </p><p> At police headquarters I explained the</p><p>case hurriedly, omitting all details except </p><p>Lhose pertaining directly to Mr. Ashton’s </p><p>death. The Chief Constable sent one of his </p><p>men into an inner room, who returned in </p><p>a moment with a small, keen-looking, ferret- </p><p>!aced man of some forty-eight or fifty years, </p><p>with gray hair, sharp gray eyes, and a </p><p>The Emerald Buddha </p><p>349 </p><p>smooth-shaveii face. He introduced him to </p><p>me as Sergeant McQuade, of Scotland Yard, </p><p>who, it seems, happened to be in the city </p><p>upon some counterfeiting case or other, and </p><p>suggested that he accompany me back to </p><p>the house. </p><p> We had scarcely left the limits of the</p><p>town behind us, when I noticed a figure in </p><p>blue, plodding slowly along the muddy road </p><p>ahead of us, in the same direction as our- </p><p>selves, and Jones, the groom, said, as we drew </p><p>alongside, that it was Li Min, whose sudden </p><p>disappearance had caused so much excite- </p><p>ment. The Chinaman looked at us with a </p><p>blandly innocent face and, nodding pleas- </p><p>antly, bade us good morning. I stopped </p><p>the cart and ordered Jones to get down </p><p>and accompany him back to the house and </p><p>on nq account to let him out of his sight. </p><p>' As we drove on I explained all the circum- </p><p>stances of the case in detail to Sergeant Mc- </p><p>Quade. In some excitement, he requested </p><p>me .to returp with him to Exeter at once. I </p><p>did hot inquire into his reasons for this step, </p><p>but complied, the Sergeant meanwhile ply- </p><p>ing' me with questions. I decided he had </p><p>concluded that Li Min had committed the </p><p>murder and hurried off to place the Emerald </p><p>Buddha in the hands of some of his country- </p><p>men in the town and arrange an alibi. This </p><p>he admitted. “It is absolutely necessary </p><p>that we prevent any Chinaman from leaving </p><p>the town until this matter is cleared up, and </p><p>there is a train to London at eight. It is </p><p>now ten minutes of nine. I am sorry you </p><p>did not notify the police at once.” </p><p> I made no reply, not wishing to prejudice</p><p>him against Major Temple.</p><p> At Exeter we got little satisfaction.</p><p>“Two of them went up on the eight o’clock </p><p>train,” the detective growled. “One of </p><p>them keeps a laundry in Frog Street. The </p><p>other was a stranger. They took tickets for </p><p>London, third class.” </p><p> When we arrived at The Oaks, as Major</p><p>Temple’s place was called, Jones and Li Min </p><p>had arrived, and the Major had subjected </p><p>the latter, he informed us, to a severe cross- </p><p>examination. The Chinaman had denied </p><p>all knowledge of Mr. Ashton’s death and </p><p>explained his own absence by saying that he </p><p>had gone into town to see his brother, re- </p><p>cently arrived from China, and knowing the </p><p>habit of the Temples to breakfast very late, </p><p>had supposed his return at nine o’clock </p><p>would pass unnoticed. I made Major </p><p>Temple acquainted with Sergeant McQuade </p><p>and we proceeded at once to the room where </p><p>lay all that now remained of the unfortunate </p><p>Robert Ashton. </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>A QUEER DISCOVERY </p><p>WE FOUND Gibson guarding the door </p><p>where we had left him. Miss Temple </p><p>was nowhere to be seen. Major Temple </p><p>took the key from his pocket and, throwing </p><p>open the room, allowed McQuade and my- </p><p>self to enter, he following us and closing the </p><p>door behind him. </p><p> McQuade examined everything carefully</p><p>—key, lock, bolt, socket, wound, windows, </p><p>outside view. Then he stooped suddenly, </p><p>picked up a small white object, a bit of lac , </p><p>I thought, and handed it to Major Temple. </p><p>“What do you make of that?” he asked. </p><p> Major Temple took the thing and spread</p><p>it out; it was a woman’s handkerchief. He </p><p>became deathly pale, and his hand shook </p><p>violently. I saw the initials M. T. in one </p><p>corner and noticed a strong and most pecu- </p><p>liar odor of perfume, some curious oriental </p><p>scent that rose from the handkerchief. </p><p>McQuade gazed at us, curiously intent. </p><p>“Do you recognize it?” he inquired. </p><p> “Yes,” said Major Temple, recovering</p><p>himself with an effort. “It is my daugh- </p><p>ter’s!” </p><p> “How do you explain its presence here? ”</p><p>asked the detective. </p><p> “I do not attempt to do so, any more than</p><p>I can undertake to explain any of the other </p><p>strange events connected with this horrible </p><p>affair,” said the Major pathetically. He </p><p>seemed to me to have aged perceptibly since </p><p>the evening before—he looked broken, old. </p><p> McQuade took the handkerchief and con-</p><p>tinued his examination of the room. I felt </p><p>ready to swear that the handkerchief had </p><p>not been upon the floor during my previous </p><p>examination of the room, yet how could its </p><p>presence there now be explained, with the </p><p>door locked, the key in Major Temple’s </p><p>pocket, and Gibson on guard in the hall ? </p><p>I thought of Muriel Temple, young, beau- </p><p>tiful, innocent in every outward appearance, </p><p>yet remembered her aversion for Ashton, </p><p>and her determination never to marry him </p><p>under any circumstances. Believing thor- </p><p>oughly in the innocence of Miss Temple, </p><p>I resolved to do all in my power to sift the </p><p>affair to the bottom. </p><p>350 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> My thoughts were interrupted by Sergeant</p><p>McQuade, who, having brought his exami- </p><p>nation to a sudden dose, announced to </p><p>Major Temple that the police and the divi- </p><p>sional surgeon would arrive shortly, and that </p><p>meanwhile he would have a look at the </p><p>grounds beneath the windows of the room. </p><p>I decided to accompany him, but suggested </p><p>to the Major that it might be well to show </p><p>Sergeant McQuade the scrap of paper, con- </p><p>taining the single Chinese character, which </p><p>we had found upon the floor. Major Temple </p><p>took it from his pocket and handed it to the </p><p>detective without a word. I could see that </p><p>the latter was puzzled. “What does it </p><p>mean?” he inquired. “Do you know?” </p><p>lie turned to Major Temple. </p><p> “ Only that it is a religious symbol used by</p><p>the Buddhist priests in China,” said the </p><p>latter. “It is found in their temples, and is </p><p>supposed to ward off evil influences.” </p><p> “Is there any reason to suppose that it</p><p>belonged to Li Min or any of his country- </p><p>men? Might it not have belonged to the </p><p>dead man himself—a copy, perhaps? A </p><p>curiosity which he might have desired to </p><p>preserve?” </p><p> I had told him nothing of the relations</p><p>between Miss Temple and Ashton, but it </p><p>was evident that the finding of her handker- </p><p>chief in the murdered man’s room had </p><p>started him off on another tack. </p><p> “ None whatever,” the Major responded.</p><p>“Yet the recovery of the jewel was beyond </p><p>question the reason for the murder, and but </p><p>four persons knew of the presence of the </p><p>jewel in this house—my daughter, Mr. Mor- </p><p>gan, Li Min, and myself.” </p><p> “ How did Li Min come to know of it? ”</p><p>“He saw us examining it*a.t dinner last </p><p>night, while waiting on the table.”</p><p> “Was the stone of such value that its re-</p><p>covery would have been sought at so great </p><p>a cost?” </p><p> “Intrinsically it was worth perhaps</p><p>a hundred thousand pounds. As a curio, or </p><p>as an object of religious veneration among </p><p>the Buddhist priests and their followers, it </p><p>was priceless!” </p><p> “A hundred thousand pounds!” ex-</p><p>claimed McQuade. “And you intended to </p><p>buy it from Mr. Ashton?” </p><p> “Yes,” theMajor stammered, “yes,Idid.”</p><p>“At what price? ” came the question, cold </p><p>and incisive. </p><p> “I—I—Mr. Ashton secured the jewel</p><p>for me as my agent.” </p><p> “But surely you were to give him some</p><p>commission, some reward? What was that </p><p>reward, Major Temple?” </p><p> “I had promised him the hand of my</p><p>daughter in marriage.” </p><p> “And was he satisfied with that settle-</p><p>ment?” continued the detective ruthlessly. </p><p> “We had a slight disagreement—he—he</p><p>wanted a cash payment in addition.” </p><p>“Which you refused?” </p><p> “The matter had not been settled.”</p><p>“And how did your daughter regard the </p><p>bargain?” asked McQuade, coldly. </p><p> Major Temple drew himself up stiffly.</p><p>“I fail to see the purpose of these ques- </p><p>tions,” he said with some heat. “My </p><p>daughter was ready to meet my wishes, </p><p>Sergeant McQuade. Mr. Ashton was a </p><p>gentleman and was much attached to her.” </p><p>As we passed out, the detective ordered </p><p>the door locked and put the key in his </p><p>pocket. I asked to accompany him in his </p><p>explorations outside, to which he readily </p><p>assented, and with a parting injunction that </p><p>Li Min be not allowed to leave the house, </p><p>we passed out into the garden. </p><p>THE storm had stopped some time </p><p>during the night, and as the tragedy </p><p>had occurred later and not long be- </p><p>fore daybreak, there was every reason to be- </p><p>lieve that traces of any one approaching the </p><p>windows of Mr. Ashton’s room would be </p><p>dearly visible and that any traces made </p><p>before or during the rain must have been </p><p>completely obliterated. There were no evi- </p><p>dences of any one’s having walked upon the </p><p>pathway since the rain, nor was it apparent </p><p>that any one could have gained access to </p><p>the windows without the aid of a ladder, </p><p>which must have left its tell-tale marks </p><p>behind. </p><p> At the end of the wing conditions were</p><p>more favorable. A covered porch encircled </p><p>the end of the building and extended along </p><p>its front. There were three windows in the </p><p>west face of the wing—one in the room which </p><p>I had occupied, one in the end of the hall- </p><p>way, and one in Mr. Ashton’s room. The </p><p>roof of the porch was directly beneath them. </p><p>Any one inside the house could have reached </p><p>the porch roof from the window at the end of </p><p>the hall and gained the window of Mr. Ash- </p><p>ton’s room. I thought of the handkerchief, </p><p>of the footsteps I fanded I had heard during </p><p>the night, and shuddered. </p><p> Presently the Sergeant stepped toward</p><p>The Emerald'Buddha </p><p>351 </p><p>the front of the house. There in the soft </p><p>gravel were the prints of a woman’s feet, </p><p>leading from the corner of the path to the </p><p>front entrance. I bent down and examined </p><p>them with curious eyes, then recoiled with </p><p>a cry of dismay. The footprints lead in one </p><p>direction only, and that was toward the </p><p>front door! </p><p> In a flash I realized what theory McQuade</p><p>would at once construct in his mind: The </p><p>murderer, reaching the porch roof from the </p><p>hallway and obtaining access to the mur- </p><p>dered man’s room through the window, </p><p>would, upon escaping from the room to the </p><p>roof, be unable to enter the house again </p><p>from the roof because of my presence in the </p><p>hall and that of the others who had ap- </p><p>peared in answer to my cries. What more </p><p>natural than to descend from the porch by </p><p>means of the heavy vines at the corner, </p><p>walk quickly along the path a few steps, re- </p><p>enter the house through the front door, and </p><p>appear almost at once among the others? </p><p>I femembered that Miss Temple had ap- </p><p>peared in a loose dressing-gown. Would she </p><p>then have had time to throw off her dress so </p><p>quickly, wet and muddy as it must have </p><p>been, and to change her shoes for slippers? </p><p>Where were these shoes? Would their con- </p><p>dition prove that she had been out of the </p><p>house during the night? </p><p> I saw McQuade examining the heavy mass</p><p>of ivy at the comer of the porch. The vine </p><p>was not broken or torn in any way as would </p><p>inevitably have been the case had any one </p><p>used it as a means of descent. But I ob- </p><p>served, though I felt sure McQuade did not, </p><p>a lightning-rod from the roof of the wing </p><p>down to the porch roof, across it, and thence </p><p>to the ground. Had any one descended in </p><p>this way, he would have walked along the </p><p>border between the porch and the path to</p><p>(he corner. Here he would have been </p><p>obliged to step on to the gravel. Footsteps </p><p>upon the grass would have left no mark. </p><p>I DID not call McQuade’s attention </p><p>to this at the time. He strode along </p><p>the path to the steps leading to the </p><p>large front porch, tracing the muddy foot- </p><p>prints to the porch and upon its floor, where </p><p>they became no longer perceptible. He then </p><p>entered the house and at once made for the </p><p>upper hall in the west wing. His first </p><p>move was to examine the window at the end </p><p>of the hall, which, I was not surprised to find, </p><p>was unfastened. His second was to step out </p><p>upon the roof. No sooner had I joined him </p><p>here then he crossed to the window of the </p><p>green room and peered in. The interior of </p><p>the room was clearly visible, but the win- </p><p>dow was tightly bolted within. </p><p> The Sergeant looked distinctly disap-</p><p>pointed. Then, with a low whistle, he </p><p>pointed to a mark upon the white window- </p><p>sill which had escaped both his and my atten- </p><p>tion. It was the faint print of a hand—a </p><p>bloody hand—small and delicate in struc- </p><p>ture. Yet it pointed, not outward from the </p><p>room, as though made by some one leaving </p><p>it, but inward, as by a person standing on </p><p>the roof and resting his or her hand upon the </p><p>window-sill while attempting to open the </p><p>window! </p><p> “What do you make of that, sir?” in-</p><p>quired the detective. </p><p> “ No one would get out of a window that</p><p>way.” </p><p> “Except a woman,” said McQuade dryly.</p><p>“A man would swing his legs over the sill </p><p>and drop to the roof. It’s barely three feet. </p><p>But a woman would sit upon the sill, turn </p><p>on her stomach, rest her hands on the sill </p><p>with her fingers pointing toward the room, </p><p>and slide gently down until her feet touched </p><p>the roof beneath.” </p><p> “The whole thing is impossible,” I re-</p><p>torted, with some heat. “ There’s no sense </p><p>in talking about how any one may or may </p><p>not have got out of the room, when the </p><p>bolted window proves that np one got either </p><p>in or out at all.” </p><p> “Perhaps you think that poor devil in</p><p>there killed himself?” said the detective </p><p>grimly. “ The window was bolted after the </p><p>murder!” </p><p> “By the murdered man, I suppose,” I re-</p><p>torted ironically. </p><p> “Not necessarily,” he replied coldly, “but</p><p>possibly by some one who desired to shield </p><p>the murderer.” He looked at me squarely,</p><p>but I was able to meet his gaze without any </p><p>misgivings. </p><p> “I was the first person who entered the</p><p>room,” I said earnestly, “and I am pre- </p><p>pared to make oath that the window was </p><p>bolted when I entered.” </p><p> “Was the room dark?” he inquired.</p><p> “It was.” I answered, not perceiving the</p><p>drift of his remarks. </p><p> “ Did you examine the windows at once? ”</p><p> “No.”</p><p> “ What did you do? ”</p><p> “I knelt down and examined the body.”</p><p>352 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “What was Major Temple doing?”</p><p> “I—I did not notice, I think he began</p><p>to examine the things in Mr. Ashton’s port- </p><p>manteau.” </p><p> “Then, Mr. Morgan, if, occupied as you</p><p>were, you did not notice Major Temple’s </p><p>movements, I fail to see how you can swear </p><p>as to the window at the time you entered the </p><p>room.” </p><p> “Your suggestion is impossible, Sergeant</p><p>McQuade. Had Major Temple bolted the </p><p>window I should certainly have noticed it.” </p><p>The Sergeant smiled slightly. </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>A WOMAN IN THE NET </p><p>\JTTE DESCENDED to the library, where </p><p>W Major Temple sat waiting. “Well, </p><p>Mr. Morgan?” he inquired excitedly. </p><p> “Mr. McQuade can perhaps tell you,”</p><p>I replied, </p><p>“I can tell you more, Major Temple,” </p><p>said the detective gravely, “ if you will first </p><p>let me have a few words with Miss Temple.” </p><p>“With my daughter?” exclaimed the </p><p>Major, evidently much surprised. </p><p> “Yes, And 5 you do not mind, Major</p><p>Temple, I should much prefer to have you </p><p>send one of the servants for her. I have </p><p>a particular reason for desiring you to re- </p><p>main here.” </p><p> I thought at first that Major Temple was</p><p>going to resent this, but although he flushed </p><p>hotly, he strode to a call-bell and pressed it, </p><p>then: </p><p> “I think you would do better to question</p><p>Li Min.” </p><p> “I do not intend to omit doing that," re-</p><p>plied McQuade. </p><p> We remained in uneasy silence until the</p><p>maid returned with Miss Temple who, dis- </p><p>missing her at the door, faced us with a look </p><p>upon her face of unfeigned surprise, pale and </p><p>greatly agitated. I felt that she had not</p><p>slept, and the dark circles under her eyes </p><p>confirmed my belief. “You sent for me, </p><p>father?” she inquired nervously. </p><p> “ Sergeant McQuade here”—he indicated</p><p>the detective whom Miss Temple recognized </p><p>by a slight inclination of her head—“wishes </p><p>to ask you a few questions.” </p><p> “Me?” Her voice had in it a note of</p><p>alarm which was not lost upon the man from </p><p>Scotland Yard. </p><p> “I think you may be able to clear up a</p><p>few points that at present I can not quite </p><p>understand.” </p><p> “I’m afraid I can not help you much,” she</p><p>said gravely. </p><p> “Possibly more than you think, miss.</p><p>I understand your father had promised your </p><p>hand in marriage to Mr. Ashton.” </p><p> Miss Temple favored me with a quick and</p><p>bitter glance. I knew that she felt this in- </p><p>formation had come from me. </p><p> “Yes?” She replied. “That is true.”</p><p> “Did you desire to marry him?”</p><p> The girl looked at her father in evident</p><p>uncertainty. </p><p> “I—I—Why should I answer such a ques-</p><p>tion?” She turned to the detective with </p><p>scornful eyes. “It is purely my own affair, </p><p>and of no consequence—now.” </p><p> “That is true, miss,” replied the Sergeant,</p><p>with deeper gravity. “Still, I do not see </p><p>that the truth can do any one any harm.” </p><p>Miss Temple flushed and hesitated a mo- </p><p>ment, then: “I would rather have died than </p><p>have married him!” </p><p> McQuade had made her lose her temper,</p><p>for which I inwardly hated him. His next </p><p>question left her cold with fear. </p><p> “When did you last see Mr. Ashton</p><p>alive? ” he demanded. </p><p> The girl hesitated, turned suddenly pale,</p><p>then threw back her head with a look of </p><p>proud determination. “ I refuse to answer </p><p>that question!” she said defiantly. </p><p> Her father had been regarding her with</p><p>amazed surprise. “Muriel,” he said in </p><p>a trembling voice, “what do you mean? </p><p>You left Mr. Ashton and myself in the din- </p><p>ing-room at a little after nine.” </p><p> She made no reply.</p><p>Sergeant McQuade slowly took from his </p><p>pocket the handkerchief he had found in </p><p>Mr. Ashton’s room. “Is this yours, miss? ” </p><p>Miss Temple took it, mechanically. </p><p>“Yes,” she said. </p><p> “It was found beside the murdered man’s</p><p>body,” said the detective. </p><p> For a moment I thought Miss Temple</p><p>was going to faint, and I instinctively </p><p>moved toward her. She recovered herself </p><p>at once. “Is it possible you suppose I had </p><p>anything to do with Mr. Ashton’s death?” </p><p>“I have not said so, miss. This handker- </p><p>chief was found in Mr. Ashton’s room. It </p><p>is possible that he had it himself, as a souve- </p><p>nir of some former meeting, although in that </p><p>case it would hardly have retained this </p><p>strong scent of perfume. But you might </p><p>t </p><p>The Emerald Buddha </p><p>353 </p><p>have dropped it at table—he may have </p><p>picked it up that very night. I desire only </p><p>the truth, Miss Temple. Tell us, if you can, </p><p>how the handkerchief came in Mr. Ashton’s </p><p>room.” </p><p> I saw Miss Temple’s face change. I</p><p>waited anxiously for the next words. </p><p> “I last saw Mr. Ashton,” she answered,</p><p>with a faint blush, “last night about </p><p>midnight!” </p><p> HER answer was as much of a sur-</p><p>dfra prise to me as it evidently was </p><p>to both Major Temple and the </p><p>detective. </p><p> “Muriel!” cried the former.</p><p> “I went to his room immediately after he</p><p>retired,” continued Miss Temple, with evi- </p><p>dent effort. “I wished to tell him some- </p><p>thing—something important, before the </p><p>morning, when it might have been too late. </p><p>I was afraid to stand in the hallway and talk </p><p>to him through the open door for fear </p><p>I should be seen. I went inside. I must </p><p>have dropped the handkerchief at that </p><p>time.” </p><p> “ Will you tell us what you wished to say</p><p>to Mr. Ashton that you regarded as so im- </p><p>portant as to take you to his room at mid- </p><p>night? ” </p><p> Again Miss Temple hesitated, then evi-</p><p>dently decided to tell all. “I went to tell </p><p>him,” she said gravely, “that no matter </p><p>what my father might promise him, I would </p><p>I'B/use to marry him under any circumstances. </p><p>I told him that if he turned over the emer- </p><p>ald to my father under any such promise, he </p><p>would do so at his own risk. I begged him </p><p>to release me from the engagement which </p><p>my father had made, and to give me back </p><p>a letter in which, at my father’s demand, </p><p>I had in a moment of weakness consented </p><p>to it.” </p><p> “And he refused?” asked the detective.</p><p> “He refused.” Miss Temple bowed her</p><p>head and I saw from the tears in her eyes</p><p>that her endurance and spirit under this </p><p>cross-questioning were fast deserting her. </p><p> “Then what did you do?”</p><p> “I went back to my room.”</p><p> “Did you retire?”</p><p> “No.”</p><p> “Did you remove your clothing?”</p><p> “I did not. I threw myself upon the bed</p><p>until-” She hesitated, and I suddenly </p><p>saw the snare into which she had been </p><p>Led. </p><p> “Until what?” he asked bluntly.</p><p> “Until—this morning,” she concluded,</p><p>and I instinctively felt that she was not tell- </p><p>ing the truth. </p><p> “Until you heard the commotion in the</p><p>hall?” inquired McQuade insinuatingly. </p><p> “Yes,” she answered.</p><p> “Then, Miss Temple, how do you explain</p><p>the fact that you appeared immediately in </p><p>the hall as soon as the house was aroused, </p><p>in your slippers and a dressing-gown?” </p><p> She saw that she had been trapped. “I</p><p>had begun to change,” she said nervously. </p><p> “Were you out of the house this morning,</p><p>Miss Temple, at or about the time of the </p><p>murder? Were you at the corner of the </p><p>porch under Mr. Ashton’s room? ” The de- </p><p>tective’s manner was brutal in its crue! </p><p>insistence. </p><p> Miss Temple gasped faintly. “I—I re-</p><p>fuse to answer any more questions!” she </p><p>cried, and, sobbing violently, turned and </p><p>left the room. </p><p> McQuade strode quickly toward Major</p><p>Temple, who had observed the scene in </p><p>amazed and horrified silence. “Major </p><p>Temple,” he said sternly, “I must ask to go </p><p>at once to Miss Temple’s room!” </p><p> “To her room? Sir,” thundered the</p><p>Major, “do you mean to imply that my </p><p>daughter had any hand in this business? </p><p>By-sir, I warn you-” He towered </p><p>over the detective, his face flushed, his </p><p>clenched fist raised in anger. </p><p> McQuade held up his hand. “Major</p><p>Temple, the truth can harm no one who is </p><p>innocent. Miss Temple has not been en- </p><p>tirely frank. I must search her room at </p><p>once!” With a growl of suppressed rage the </p><p>girl’s father led the way to her room. The </p><p>detective went to a large closet between the </p><p>dressing-room and bedroom, threw it open, </p><p>and drew forth a pair of boots, damp and </p><p>covered with mud, and a brown tweed </p><p>walking-skirt, the lower edge of which was </p><p>still damp and mud-stained. “ Major Tem- </p><p>ple,” he said, “your daughter left the house,</p><p>in these shoes and this slurt, some time close </p><p>to daybreak. The murder occurred about </p><p>that time. If you will induce her to tell </p><p>why she did so, and why she seems so anxi- </p><p>ous to conceal the fact, it will naturally </p><p>assist us in aiming at the truth!” </p><p> As he concluded, sounds below announced</p><p>the arrival of the police and the divisional </p><p>surgeon, and with a curt nod he left us and </p><p>descended to the hall. </p><p>354 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> CHAPTER VI</p><p>I ADVISE MISS TEMPLE </p><p>AS I DID not suppose that I should be </p><p>wanted, I left the house and started out </p><p>across the beautiful lawns. I met Miss Tem- </p><p>ple coming along the porch, evidently pre- </p><p>pared for a walk, so I suggested, rather </p><p>awkwardly, remembering her look of an- </p><p>noyance during the examination, that I </p><p>should be happy to accompany her. Some- </p><p>what to my surprise she accepted my offer </p><p>at once, and we started briskly off. </p><p> She was silent all the way down to the</p><p>entrance to the grounds, but as we set out </p><p>along the main road she said with surprising </p><p>suddenness: “Do you believe, Mr. Morgan, </p><p>that I had any part in this terrible affair?” </p><p>“Certainly not," I said. “And if you will </p><p>permit me to say so, Miss Temple, I think </p><p>you would have been wiser had you been </p><p>entirely frank with him.” </p><p> “What do you mean?” she asked in-</p><p>dignantly. </p><p> I felt disappointed somehow, at her man-</p><p>ner* “Miss Temple,” I said gently, “I am </p><p>sorry you were not frank about your leaving </p><p>the house, as he believes you did, early this </p><p>morning.” </p><p> “Why does he believe that?” she asked</p><p>spiritedly. </p><p> ‘Because he found the footprints of a</p><p>woman’s shoe in the gravel walk, from the </p><p>west corner of the porch to the main en- </p><p>trance. They lead only one way. He </p><p>found the skirt and shoes you wore, wet and </p><p>covered with mud. The footprints were </p><p>made after the rain, or they would have been </p><p>washed away and obliterated by it.” </p><p> “The brute!” said Miss Temple in-</p><p>dignantly. “To enter my rooms! But </p><p>suppose I did go outside at that time— </p><p>suppose I had decided to run away from the </p><p>wretched conspiracy against my happiness? </p><p>I came back, did I not? ” </p><p> “ Why,” I inquired, “ did you come back? ”</p><p>She glanced quickly at me, with a look of</p><p>fear. “I—I—that I refuse to explain to </p><p>any one!” </p><p> “You will remember, Miss Temple, that</p><p>the footprints lead in one direction only and </p><p>that was toward the house. Mr. McQuade </p><p>does not believe you left the house in the </p><p>same way you returned to it.” </p><p> “What on earth does he believe, llisa?”</p><p>she inquired with a slight laugh, which was </p><p>the first sign of brightness I had seen in her </p><p>since the night before. I could not help </p><p>admiring her beautiful mouth and her white, </p><p>even teeth as she turned inquiringly to me. </p><p>Yet my answer was such as to drive that </p><p>smile from her face for a long time to come. </p><p> “That whoever committed the murder</p><p>reached the porch roof by means of the win- </p><p>dow at the end of the upper hall, and after </p><p>entering and leaving Mr. Ashton’s room, </p><p>descended in some way from the porch to </p><p>the pathway, and reentered the house by </p><p>the main entrance. Your footsteps are the </p><p>only ones so far that fit in with this theory.” </p><p>“IT IS ABSURD!” said my com- </p><p>panion, with a look of terror. “ How </p><p>could the window have been re- </p><p>bolted? Why should the murderer not have </p><p>reentered the house in the same way he left </p><p>it? How does he know that there was any </p><p>one upon the roof at all?” </p><p> “He claims that some one interested in</p><p>the murderer’s welfare might have rebolted </p><p>the window upon entering the room. That </p><p>would mean either your father or. myself. </p><p>Whoever committed the crime feared to </p><p>enter the hall by the window after the house </p><p>had been aroused. There is positive evi- </p><p>dence of some one’s having been upon the </p><p>roof.” </p><p> “What evidence?” Her clenched hands</p><p>and rapid breathing indicated some intense </p><p>inward emotion. </p><p> “The faint print of a hand—in bicc.d,</p><p>upon the window-sill. Miss Temple, you </p><p>will, I’m sure, see the advisability of ex- </p><p>plaining fully, in order that the investiga- </p><p>tions may be turned in other directions, </p><p>where the guilt lies, instead of in yours, </p><p>where I am sure it does not.” </p><p> She seemed suddenly stricken with terror.</p><p>“I can say nothing, nothing whatever!” she </p><p>answered pathetically, her face a picture of </p><p>anguish. </p><p> I felt alarmed, and indeed greatly dis-</p><p>appointed at her manner. Limiting the </p><p>crime to three people, one of whom must </p><p>have been upon the porch roof a little before </p><p>daybreak, I saw at once that suspicion must</p><p>inevitably fall upon either Miss Temple or </p><p>her father. Yet there remained one other </p><p>possibility—the Chinaman, Li Min. His </p><p>hands, small and delicate, might possibly </p><p>have made the tell-tale print upon the </p><p>window-sill, but in that event, why should </p><p>Miss Temple hesitate to tell of it, had she </p><p>The Emerald Buddha </p><p>355 </p><p>seen Mm? The only possible solution filled </p><p>me with horror—that Miss Temple and Li </p><p>Min were acting together—that her father, </p><p>too, was in the plot, as he must have been if </p><p>he rebolted the window. The thing was </p><p>dearly impossible, yet otherwise the China- </p><p>man was dearly innocent, .for I believed </p><p>without question that had he entered the </p><p>room and committed the murder he could </p><p>in no possible way have bolted the window </p><p>himself from without. Yet as I looked at </p><p>the strong, beautiful face of the girl beside </p><p>me I could not think that, whatever she </p><p>might be led to do for the sake of some one </p><p>else, she could never have committed such </p><p>a crime herself! </p><p> I also remembered suddenly Major Tem-</p><p>ple’s angry remark, made to Robert Ashton </p><p>the night before, that he would never allow </p><p>Ashton to leave the house with the emerald </p><p>in his possession. Was she shielding her </p><p>father? Was it he, then, that she had seen </p><p>upon the roof? </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>THE ERON POKER </p><p>AS I WENT to my room I met Sergeant </p><p>McQuade in the hall. The divisional </p><p>surgeon had returned to the town, the body </p><p>had been removed to a large, unused billiard- </p><p>room on the ground floor, and the inquest </p><p>was set for the following morning at eleven. </p><p>Alsc, the two Chinamen who had left </p><p>Exeter ’on the morning train had been ap- </p><p>prehended in London and were being held </p><p>there. He proposed to run up to town as </p><p>soon as the inquest was over. A careful and </p><p>detailed search of Mr. Ashton’s room and </p><p>belongings had failed to reveal any further </p><p>light upon the murder or any traces of the </p><p>missing Emerald Buddha. </p><p> After luncheon Sergeant McQuade asked</p><p>Major Temple to meet him in the library, </p><p>accompanied by Li Min, and at the Major’s </p><p>request I joined them. The Chinaman was </p><p>stolidly indifferent and perfectly collected </p><p>and calm. His right hand was bound up </p><p>with a strip of white cloth. He spoke Eng- </p><p>lish brokenly, but seemed to understand </p><p>quite well all that was said to him.</p><p> “Li Min,” said Major Temple, address-</p><p>ing the man, “this gentleman washes to ask </p><p>you some questions.” </p><p> “All light.” The Chinaman faced Mc-</p><p>Quade with a look of bland inquiry. </p><p> “Where did you spend last night?”</p><p> “Me spend turn with blother at Exeter.”</p><p> “What time did you leave there?”</p><p> “P’iaps ’leven o’clock, sometime.”</p><p> “Was it raining?”</p><p> “Yes, velly much lain.”</p><p> “You did not go to bed, then?”</p><p> “No, no go to bed; go Exeter.”</p><p> The Sergeant looked at him sternly.</p><p>“Your bed was not made this morning. </p><p>You are lying to me.” </p><p> “No, no lie. Bed not made flom day</p><p>before. I make him myself.” </p><p> The detective turned to Major Temple.</p><p>“Is this fellow telling the truth?”he asked. </p><p>“Does he make his own bed?” </p><p> “Yes,” replied the Major. “The other</p><p>servants refused to have anything to do </p><p>with him. They are afraid to enter his </p><p>room.” </p><p> “What did you do in Exeter?” asked</p><p>McQuade. </p><p> “P’laps talkee some, smokee some, eatee</p><p>some—play fan-tan—bimeby sleep.” </p><p>“What’s the matter with your hand?” </p><p>“Me cuttee hand, bloken bottle—Exe- </p><p>ter.” </p><p> “What kind of a bottle?”</p><p>“Whisky-bottle,” answered Li Min, with </p><p>a childlike smile. </p><p> McQuade turned away with a gesture of</p><p>impatience. “He knows a great deal more </p><p>than he lets on, but there’s no way to get </p><p>it out of him. Do any of the other servants </p><p>sleep near him? ” </p><p> “He sleeps in a small room on the third</p><p>floor of the east wing, which has a back </p><p>stairway to the ground floor,” said the </p><p>Major. “The other house servants sleep </p><p>on the second floor of the rear extension, </p><p>over the kitchen and pantries. My daugh- </p><p>ter generally sees to the locking up of the </p><p>house.” </p><p> “Did she do so last night?”</p><p> “No. I locked the rear entrance before</p><p>I retired shortly before midnight.” </p><p> “After Mr. Ashton had left you?”</p><p> “Immediately after.”</p><p>“Then if Li Min had left the house by </p><p>that time, you would not have known it? ” </p><p>“No. I sat up with Mr. Ashton until </p><p>quite late—perhaps for two hours or more </p><p>after dinner.”</p><p> “Did you have any quarrel with Mr.</p><p>Ashton before he left you?” </p><p> Major Temple glanced at me with a</p><p>slight frown. “We had some words,” he </p><p>356 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>said, hesitating slightly, “but they were </p><p>not of any serious consequence. We had a </p><p>slight disagreement about the price he was </p><p>to be paid for his services in addition to the </p><p>other arrangement. We agreed to leave it </p><p>until the morning.” </p><p> “You quarreled violently?”</p><p> “I—we did not agree,” stammered the</p><p>Major. </p><p> “Did Mr. Ashton threaten to take the</p><p>stone elsewhere? ” </p><p> “He mentioned something of the sort, I</p><p>believe.” </p><p> “To which you objected strongly?”</p><p> “I protested, most certainly. I regarded</p><p>the stone as my property. He acted as my </p><p>agent only.” </p><p> McQuade remained silent for some mo-</p><p>ments, then: </p><p> “Major Temple, I shall leave one of my</p><p>men on the premises. When I return this </p><p>evening I should like to hear the complete </p><p>history of this jewel, so that we may the </p><p>better understand how far the former owners </p><p>would go in their efforts to recover it.” </p><p>AFTER McQuade had gone, I sug- </p><p>gested to Major Temple that I </p><p>might remove myself and my be- </p><p>longings to Exeter, but he would not hear </p><p>of it. I strolled into the town, however, </p><p>and dispatched a telegram to my mother, </p><p>in Torquay, advising her that I would be </p><p>delayed in joining her. On my way back, </p><p>just after sunset, as I emerged from the </p><p>wood near a hedge which separated it from </p><p>the kitchen-gardens of The Oaks I ob- </p><p>served two figures standing near a gateway </p><p>:'n the hedge, talking together earnestly. </p><p>Just then they separated and one of them </p><p>disappeared swiftly into the wood; the </p><p>other advanced rapidly toward the house </p><p>and I saw that it was Li Min. The circum- </p><p>stance filled me with vague suspicions. </p><p> Instinctively I turned toward the west</p><p>wing and, as I reached the rear comer of the </p><p>building, stepped back on the grass, beyond </p><p>the gravel walk, to obtain a view of the </p><p>windows above. Suddenly I tripped over </p><p>an object in the grass and nearly fell. It </p><p>was a short, thick, iron poker with a heavy </p><p>octagonal brass knob at one end As I </p><p>held it in my hand, I realized at once that</p><p>with such a weapon as this the strange </p><p>wound in Ashton's head could really have </p><p>been made. But beyond being somewhat </p><p>stained from lying in the wet grass, it </p><p>showed no marks of the gruesome use to </p><p>which I instinctively felt it had been put. </p><p> Wrapping it carefully in my handker-</p><p>chief, 1 carried it to my room and took the </p><p>precaution to lock it safely in one of the </p><p>drawers of the dresser, pending an oppor- </p><p>tunity to show it privately to Sergeant Mc- </p><p>Quade upon his return from Exeter. </p><p>CHAPTER VIII </p><p>MAJOR TEMPLE’S STORY </p><p>IN THE dimly b'ghted1 library, after </p><p>dinner, the Major proceeded to tell </p><p>McQuade and myself his experiences, and </p><p>those of Robert Ashton, in the pursuit of </p><p>the Emerald Buddha. He seemed anxious </p><p>to do this and showed no feeling of ani- </p><p>mosity toward the man from Scotland Yard. </p><p> “I spent almost all of last year,” said the</p><p>Major, “in the interior of China. My </p><p>daughter and I arrived at Pekin early last </p><p>Spring, and about a month afterward we </p><p>began an extensive trip toward the west. </p><p>We paid good prices for what we bought, </p><p>had no religious views to promulgate, and </p><p>by minding our own business strictly, we </p><p>had no trouble with the natives of any </p><p>serious moment. I had managed to pick </p><p>up a few samples of old porcelain and one </p><p>or two excellent ivories of great age and </p><p>beauty, but beyond these, the trip had not </p><p>yielded much in the way of curios for my </p><p>collection, when in June we reached tilt </p><p>city of Ping Yang. </p><p> “We found this place peculiarly interest-</p><p>ing to us, with a population noticeably </p><p>different from the inhabitants of the sea- </p><p>port towns, and we remained there perhaps </p><p>a month. I spent a good deal of time wan- </p><p>dering about the town, looking at such ex- </p><p>amples of old bronzes, embroideries, curious </p><p>bits of jewelry, and so forth, as I could </p><p>find in the shops and bazaars, and I fre- </p><p>quently had occasion to pass a small Budd- </p><p>hL-t temple in one of the lower quarters of </p><p>the town. It was a small one, but notable </p><p>because a portion of the bone of the little </p><p>finger of Buddha was said to be preserved </p><p>among the relics of the shrine. I had fre- </p><p>quently observed the priest sunning him- </p><p>self outside its doorway and on several oc- </p><p>casions I had dropped some coins into his </p><p>hand with a salutation which would be </p><p>equivalent to our English ‘Good Luck.’ </p><p>“One day when I was passing I remarked</p><p>The Emerald Buddha </p><p>357 </p><p>to one of my servants, who understood </p><p>English fairly well, that I was curious to see </p><p>the interior of the shrine, and he, after a </p><p>conversation with the temple priest, in- </p><p>formed me that there would be no ob- </p><p>jection to my doing so. </p><p> “After the priest had shown me every-</p><p>thing in the room with much pride—he </p><p>seemed a simple and earnest old fellow—I </p><p>made ready to depart and drew from my </p><p>pocket a handful of brass coins and thrust </p><p>them into his outstretched hands. He </p><p>seemed deeply grateful and said a few </p><p>words in his native tongue to my servant, </p><p>who turned to me with the information </p><p>that the priest was about to accord me an </p><p>expecial honor by showing me the sacred </p><p>relic of the Buddha. </p><p> “He approached the altar and, taking a</p><p>key from his girdle, opened a small gold </p><p>box covered with wonderful repousse work, </p><p>resting upon the knees of the god. Upon </p><p>opening this box he drew forth a small </p><p>ivory shrine, also elaborately carved, which </p><p>he set upon the top of the first box and ar- </p><p>ranged so that the light from the candles </p><p>fell upon it. He then opened the ivory box </p><p>with a small gold key, and I looked in. </p><p>The relic of the Buddha, a small and insig- </p><p>nificant looking piece of dirty brown bone. </p><p>I paid slight attention to, for in that box, </p><p>glistening and glowing with the most won- </p><p>derful color in the light of the candles stood </p><p>the Emerald Buddha! </p><p> ‘U inquired as to the gem’s history and</p><p>was informed that it had been brought to </p><p>Ping Yang many centuries before by the </p><p>priest who brought the relic from Thibet </p><p>and founded the temple. Neither the fact </p><p>of its enormous size and value as a jewel, </p><p>nor its priceless beauty as an example of </p><p>most exquisite workmanship seemed to </p><p>appeal to him. To him its value was </p><p>solely of a religious nature, an image </p><p>always’ venerated, next to the relic, as </p><p>the most precious of all the temple’s </p><p>possessions. </p><p> “I told my servant to ask the priest if</p><p>they would sell it, but he seemed disin- </p><p>clined to make the request until I repeated </p><p>my injunction rather sharply. When the </p><p>message had been repeated to the old .man, </p><p>he scowled darkly and, hastily locking his </p><p>treasures in their double box, he turned </p><p>without making any reply and began to </p><p>usher us from the room. I repeated the</p><p>request, this time using my own store of </p><p>Chinese, and drew forth a large roil of gold, </p><p>but the priest waved me aside with an </p><p>angry word, which sounded like a curse, </p><p>and pointed to the door. There was nothing </p><p>left but to go, and I did so, though with the </p><p>bitterest regret. </p><p>“IN THE course of the next week I </p><p>several times attempted to repeat </p><p>my offer, but he invariably drew </p><p>back with a look of intense hatred and re- </p><p>fused to listen to me. Upon my fourth or </p><p>fifth attempt I found him in company with </p><p>several other Chinamen, who regarded me </p><p>with dark looks and muttered impreca- </p><p>tions, and.the next time I appeared in the </p><p>street I found myself surrounded by quite </p><p>a mob of excited Chinamen, who assailed </p><p>me with fierce curses and cries and even </p><p>made as though to offer me personal vio- </p><p>lence. </p><p> “After that I felt that it would be unsafe</p><p>for me to venture into that quarter of the </p><p>town again, and a few days later, finding </p><p>that even in other sections of the city I was </p><p>regarded with evident suspicion and dislike, </p><p>I decided to leave the place and return to </p><p>Pekin and Hong Kong. </p><p> “It was in the latter city that I met</p><p>Robert Ashton who, like myself, was col- </p><p>lecting in China and who, I soon found, pos- </p><p>sessed an extraordinary knowledge of the </p><p>subject. This formed a bond of sympathy </p><p>between us. During our stay there we saw </p><p>a great deal of Mr. Ashton and he soon be- </p><p>came very attentive to my daughter. She </p><p>seemed rather to welcome Mr. Ashton’s </p><p>attentions and I was gratified to think that </p><p>in him I might find a son-in-law who would </p><p>appreciate the collection which has been </p><p>my life-work. </p><p> “He informed me that although he had</p><p>been in Ping Yang he had never heard of </p><p>the Emerald Buddha, and proposed to me </p><p>that he should attempt to secure the jewel </p><p>for me. I made light of this, but when he </p><p>said in all seriousness one night that he </p><p>would obtain it for me provided I would </p><p>consent to his marriage to my daughter, I </p><p>agreed, both because I felt his quest was </p><p>absolutely hopeless, and because I saw no </p><p>objections to him as a son-in-law in any </p><p>event. I did not mention my agreement </p><p>to my daughter, not wishing her to think </p><p>1 was bartering her in return for a mere </p><p>jewel, and I felt certain she would welcome </p><p>Mr. Ashton’s advances. A few days later </p><p>358</p><p>Adventure </p><p>he departed for Pekin, and we started home </p><p>by way of India and Suez. </p><p> “ Upon my return I questioned my daugh-</p><p>ter and was amazed and horrified to learn </p><p>that she bore toward Mr. Ashton a feeling </p><p>almost of aversion. I explained to her about </p><p>the promise and at my earnest request and </p><p>almost at my command she wrote to Mr. </p><p>Ashton, agreeing to abide by my wishes in </p><p>the matter. That was six or eight months </p><p>ago, and I heard nothing from him until two </p><p>days ago, when he telegraphed that he had </p><p>arrived in England and would come to see </p><p>me at once.” </p><p>“HIS story, as he related it to me </p><p>last night, was like an adventure </p><p>from the ‘Arabian Nights.’ He </p><p>arrived in Ping Yang one evening at dusk, </p><p>disguised as a Buddhist pilgrim monk with </p><p>shaved head and staff in hand, and at once </p><p>proceeded to the temple with an offering of </p><p>flowers and prostrated himself before the </p><p>shrine in prayer. </p><p> “Ashton continued in his place, muttering</p><p>his prayers and pretending to be in great </p><p>agony of spirit, until one by one the wor- </p><p>shippers departed. He pretended to be </p><p>suffering from some sudden illness, and lay </p><p>upon the floor moaning pitifully. As the old </p><p>priest bent over him in inquiry Ashton sud- </p><p>denly seized him by the throat and with his </p><p>powerful hands choked him into silence. He </p><p>then gagged him and, taking the keys of the </p><p>small shrine, proceeded to abstract the </p><p>coveted Emerald Buddha. </p><p> “By the next morning Ashton, with his</p><p>servant, was miles away, journeying peace- </p><p>ably toward Pekin as an English traveler. </p><p>His escape, however, was not to be so easily </p><p>effected. After progressing toward Pekin </p><p>for two days they became aware that they </p><p>were being followed by a numerous party of </p><p>Chinese upon horseback, armed with pikes, </p><p>bows and arrows, and some muskets. </p><p>Swerving from the main road, they aban- </p><p>doned their horses, and while Ashton hid in </p><p>the underbrush, his servant procured at </p><p>a near village a set of Chinese clothing </p><p>which Ashton donned. From here on his </p><p>adventures were exciting and varied, but </p><p>they at last succeeded in reaching the </p><p>coast. </p><p> “The rest of the story you know. God</p><p>knows what influences have been at work in </p><p>his taking off! As for me, I know no more </p><p>about it than you do.” </p><p> AS MAJOR TEMPLE concluded</p><p>his story, he gazed at Sergeant </p><p>McQuade and myself in turn, then </p><p>passed his hand nervously over his fore- </p><p>head, as though the strain of the tragedy </p><p>had begun to tell upon him severely. Bid- </p><p>ing him good-night, McQuade and I left </p><p>the room, leaving him sitting dejectedly in </p><p>his easy chair, patting the head of his great </p><p>mastiff, Boris. </p><p>CHAPTER IX </p><p>THE ORIENTAL PERFUME </p><p>rT"'HE inquest, held the following day in tfie </p><p>A biUiard-room, was a brief affair. The </p><p>surgeon testified to a simple fracture of the </p><p>skull, not necessarily sufficient to produce </p><p>death, although capable of doing so when </p><p>combined with nervous shock or a weakened </p><p>condition of the heart. That one or both of </p><p>the latter agencies had combined with the </p><p>result of the blow was evidenced by Ash- </p><p>ton’s almost instantaneous death and the </p><p>look of horror which was upon his face. </p><p>There was nothing for the jury to do but </p><p>render a verdict stating that Robert Ashton </p><p>had come to his death through a blow upon </p><p>the head, delivered with some sharp instru- </p><p>ment by a person or persons, unknown. </p><p> I spoke a few words to Sergeant McQuade</p><p>at the close of the inquest and he informed </p><p>me that he intended going up to London </p><p>early that afternoon to interrogate the tvm </p><p>Chinamen detained there since the preced- </p><p>ing day, and upon my volunteering to ac- </p><p>company him, he seemed rather to welcome </p><p>my suggestion. I knew perfectly well that </p><p>until the mystery was solved, not only my- </p><p>self, but Major and Miss Temple and Li </p><p>Min, as well as the other servants in the </p><p>house would all be more or less under police </p><p>surveillance, and I wanted if possible to stay </p><p>with this case to the end—a feeling that </p><p>became intensified whenever I thought of </p><p>Muriel Temple. If I could do anything to </p><p>help her, I would, cost what it might. </p><p> I hastened to my room, therefore, and for</p><p>a time busied myself in arranging my lug- </p><p>gage. As I did so I thought I heard a slight </p><p>sound in the green room across the hall, the </p><p>one in which the tragedy had occurred, and </p><p>glancing into the mirror of my dresser, I saw </p><p>Li Min. He was evidently searching for </p><p>something. Now if he, or any of his con- </p><p>federates had killed Ashton, they certainly </p><p>The Emerald Buddha </p><p>359 </p><p>must have secured the Emerald Buddha </p><p>and taken it with them; the empty case, I </p><p>remembered, lay upon the table. What</p><p>then, could this Chinaman be searching for </p><p>with such evident eagerness and anxiety? </p><p> With a few rapid steps I crossed the in-</p><p>tervening hall and appeared in the doorway. </p><p>He at once appeared confused, and made a </p><p>quick pretense of being busily occupied in </p><p>the business of setting the room to rights. </p><p>Then I became aware of a curiously pungent, </p><p>3'et sweet, aromatic odor, which had some- </p><p>thing vaguely familiar about it, and sud- </p><p>denly it flashed into my mind that this was </p><p>the curious scent I had noticed upon Miss </p><p>Temple’s handkerchief—the one dropped by </p><p>her in Ashton’s room. </p><p> After some careful experimenting, I found</p><p>that it came from a small cake of soap, of a </p><p>dull green color, which lay upon the wash- </p><p>stand where it had evidently been left by </p><p>Ashton. I picked it up, observing its per- </p><p>fume closely, then, noticing that the China- </p><p>man was regarding me with a particularly </p><p>malevolent gaze, I retired to my room, </p><p>taking the soap with me. I had no definite </p><p>purpose in this except to keep it in order to </p><p>identify the perfume. I threw it into my </p><p>satchel and completed the arrangements for </p><p>my departure. </p><p>mm I WAS soon ready to go, and after </p><p>Bnu3 leaving my bag with one of Mc- </p><p>Quade’s men, who was to accompany </p><p>us to the railway station, I sought Miss </p><p>Temple in the hope of saying good-by to her </p><p>before my departure. I was lucky enough </p><p>to find her in the library, sewing, and looking </p><p>unusually pale and distressed. She greeted </p><p>me with rising color, and I confess that I, </p><p>too, felt a trifle of embarrassment. But the </p><p>beauty of her face, the clear, honest expres- </p><p>sion of her eyes once more convinced me </p><p>that whatever were her reasons for silence </p><p>they did not in any way implicate her in this </p><p>tangled affair. </p><p> “I have come to say good-by,” I said.</p><p> “Oh, are you going—I did not know-”</p><p>She half rose, her face filled with lively </p><p>concern. </p><p> “I’m afraid I’ve already overstayed my</p><p>time,” I replied. “After all, Miss Temple, </p><p>I came as a stranger and must thank you </p><p>and your father for making me as welcome </p><p>as you have under the existing painful cir- </p><p>cumstances.” </p><p> “I have not thought of you as a stranger,</p><p>Mr. Morgan,” she answered simply. “You </p><p>have been a great help during this trying </p><p>ordeal, and I am sorry that you must go— </p><p>very sorry.” There was a ring of sincerity </p><p>in her voice that thrilled me. My heart</p><p>gave a leap, and as I met her eyes I realized </p><p>all of a sudden that go where I might, I could </p><p>not go very far away from Muriel Temple. </p><p>“I do not go because I desire it,” I replied, </p><p>in a voice from which I could not eliminate </p><p>the depth and intensity of my feelings, “but </p><p>if it lies in my power I intend to find the </p><p>solution of this terrible affair. My reward, </p><p>if I can do so, will be the knowledge that </p><p>I have served you.” </p><p> “You are very good, Mr. Morgan. I</p><p>shall never forget it—never 1 ” She rose and </p><p>placed her hand in mine, and allowed it to </p><p>remain there for a monent—a moment which </p><p>seemed far too short to me. “Aad when </p><p>you have good news, you will come to The </p><p>Oaks and tell us about it, will you not? ” she </p><p>concluded, with a smile that went to my </p><p>heart. </p><p> “Indeed I shall, Miss Temple—you may</p><p>be sure of that! And I hope it may be </p><p>soon.” </p><p> “So do I,” she said, and I turned to leave</p><p>her. Then I suddenly bethought myself of </p><p>the strange Oriental perfume. “Miss Tem- </p><p>ple,” I said, with some hesitation—“you </p><p>will pardon me, I know, but you may re- </p><p>member that the handkerchief which was </p><p>found in Mr. Ashton’s room was strongly </p><p>scented with a powerful Oriental perfume. </p><p>May I ask what that perfume is, and where </p><p>you procured it? ” </p><p> “Perfume?” she ejaculated, iu surprise.</p><p>“Why, Mr. Morgan, I never use any— </p><p>never!” </p><p> “You never use any?” I stammered.</p><p>“But it was upon your handkerchief—I </p><p>thought that perhaps you might have got it </p><p>during your travels in China.” </p><p> “The handkerchief was mine, Mr. Mor-</p><p>gan—that is true, but of the perfume I know </p><p>absolutely nothing. Why do you ask?” </p><p> I hardly knew what reply to make. The</p><p>identity of the perfume of the soap and </p><p>the handkerchief meant nothing—pointed </p><p>to nothing, and yet I could not shake off the </p><p>idea that there was some intimate connec- </p><p>tion between them which would go far </p><p>toward solving the mystery of Robert Ash- </p><p>ton’s death. I bade her good-by with some </p><p>simple explanation of my question, and hur- </p><p>ried out to find McQuade. </p><p>360 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>I FOUND him with one of his men </p><p>dimjj upon the porch roof busily engaged </p><p>in making photographs of the bloody </p><p>hand-print upon the window-sill of the</p><p>green room. </p><p> “Is it not a curious fact, Mr. Morgan,” he</p><p>remarked, as he reached the foot of the short </p><p>ladder he had used to ascend to the roof, </p><p>“that although Li Min had not only the </p><p>motive for the murder, namely the securing </p><p>of the Emerald Buddha, but also the oppor- </p><p>tunity, and while the hand-print which I </p><p>have been photographing is small and deli- </p><p>cate, like that of a woman or of Li Min, yet </p><p>I can see no possible way in which the </p><p>windows and doors of that room could have </p><p>been bolted after the crime was committed, </p><p>neither Major Temple or yourself having </p><p>any reason to do it were Li Min the guilty </p><p>person. I have been prepared to believe all </p><p>along that Li Min was on this roof at or near </p><p>daybreak yesterday morning and I do not </p><p>mind telling you I have discovered certain </p><p>evidence which had before escaped me. Yet </p><p>how could he have entered that room, mur- </p><p>dered Mr. Ashton, secured the jewel, </p><p>climbed out of the window and shut and </p><p>bolted it behind him on the inside is beyond </p><p>my comprehension!” </p><p> “Have you searched the attic above the</p><p>room? ” I asked. </p><p> “Thoroughly,” he replied. “The lath</p><p>and plaster of the ceiling are absolutely un- </p><p>broken. The four walls offer equal impossi- </p><p>bilities,’'’ </p><p> “Then it would seem that we have ex-</p><p>hausted all possible clews,” I observed. </p><p>I did not think it worth while to take him </p><p>into my confidence regarding Li Min, or the </p><p>perfumed soap; and the brass-headed poker </p><p>which I had placed in the drawer in my </p><p>room I had for the moment completely for- </p><p>gotten. </p><p> “So it seems,” he remarked thoughtfully.</p><p>“This is by long odds the strangest case </p><p>I have ever worked on.” </p><p> As we rounded the comer of the house we</p><p>suddenly saw Li Min dart out of the main </p><p>entrance, closely pursued by the officer to </p><p>whom I had entrusted my luggage. The </p><p>Chinaman carried in his hand my Gladstone </p><p>bag and was running with incredible swift- </p><p>ness toward the road. Before I had time to </p><p>make a move, McQuade darted forward and </p><p>intercepted him, knocking from his hand </p><p>with lightning-like quickness a long knife </p><p>which he drew from his blouse. The two of </p><p>them tumbled over upon the turf, McQuade </p><p>rising first with my satchel in his hand. He </p><p>looked at it, and seeing my name upon it, </p><p>handed it to me with a grim smile. “You </p><p>must have a valuable kit here, sir,” he said,</p><p>“or else this fellow has taken leave of his </p><p>senses!” </p><p> He nodded to his assistant, who promptly</p><p>stepped forward and snapped a pair of </p><p>handcuffs upon the sullen looking Oriental. </p><p>“The whole outfit isn’t worth five pounds,” </p><p>I said, laughing, and picked up the satchel. </p><p>As I did so the catch came open and my </p><p>small collection of flannel shirts, toilet arti- </p><p>cles, sketching materials, and so forth, tum- </p><p>bled upon the grass. McQuade joined in </p><p>my laugh and assisted me in replacing </p><p>my effects. “Nothing much here, sir,” he </p><p>said, but I did not fail to notice that he ob- </p><p>served each article closely as we repacked </p><p>the satchel. </p><p>WE DROVE to town in the high </p><p>cart, and after depositing the China- </p><p>man at the jail, took a hurried </p><p>lunch at the Half Moon and left for London . </p><p>on the early afternoon express, arriving at </p><p>Waterloo Station about dusk. I gave Mc- </p><p>Quade the address of my lodgings and </p><p>studio in Tottenham Court Road, and I </p><p>left him with the understanding that if </p><p>anything significant developed he would call </p><p>upon me if I could assist him in any way. </p><p> It was past eight when I arrived at my</p><p>studio. I must have been unusually tired, </p><p>for I dozed in my chair, and was not </p><p>aroused until after eleven, when I heard a </p><p>loud knock at the studio door. I sprang </p><p>up, somewhat confused, and opening the </p><p>door found under it a note from McQuade, </p><p>requesting me to meet him at once at Num- </p><p>ber 30 Kingsgatc Street. I threw on a </p><p>warm coat and soft hat and summoned a </p><p>cab. The driver looked a bit surprised at </p><p>the address, and asked me to repeat it. </p><p> I rejoiced in the hope that the examina-</p><p>tion of the two Exeter Chinamen had re- </p><p>sulted in the discovery of both the missing </p><p>jewel and the murderer, and thought with </p><p>pleasure of the happy tidings I should bring </p><p>to Muriel. It was while occupied in these </p><p>dreams that I felt my cab draw up along- </p><p>side the curb, just as the hour of midnight </p><p>was striking from old St. Paul’s. </p><p> The house was an old one, and its exterior</p><p>was gloomy and forbidding. The whole </p><p>atmosphere of the place was depressing in </p><p>The Emerald Buddha </p><p>361 </p><p>the extreme, and I pulled the bell with feel- </p><p>ings of inward trepidation. So long an </p><p>interval elapsed before any response came </p><p>that I was on the point of ringing it again, </p><p>when I suddenly heard soft footsteps in the</p><p>hallway and the door was silently opened. </p><p>I stepped within, mechanically, unable to </p><p>observe the person who had admitted me. </p><p> I had taken but a single step into the</p><p>passage, when the door was swiftly closed </p><p>behind me and at the same instant a bag </p><p>of heavy cloth was thrust over my head </p><p>and my arms were pinioned from behind </p><p>in a vice-like grip. The bag was drawn </p><p>closely about my throat by a noose in the </p><p>edge of it, and before I knew it I felt my- </p><p>self being slowly but surely strangled. </p><p>CHAPTER X </p><p>IN THE TEMPLE OF BUDDHA </p><p>1WAS lifted bodily by two or three </p><p>silent figures and carried a consider- </p><p>able distance, part of the way down a steep </p><p>flight of stairs and through what might </p><p>have been a tunnel or cellar. Presently I </p><p>heard the opening of a heavy door and in a </p><p>moment I was thrown roughly upon a </p><p>bench, and my pockets systematically </p><p>searched. My captors evidently were not </p><p>looking for money, for the only thing they </p><p>took from me were my keys. After this </p><p>they left me, huddled up in a comer of the </p><p>bendif afraid to cry out or make a move </p><p>in any direction. </p><p> The room in which I now found myself</p><p>was as silent as the tomb, and yet I felt </p><p>that it was lighted brightly and that there </p><p>were others in it besides myself. I could </p><p>feel that it was warm, and through the </p><p>folds of the bag about my head came the </p><p>acrid, half-sweet smell of opium or Chinese </p><p>incense, or both. I realized at once that I </p><p>was in the hands of some of Li Min’s </p><p>friends, and no doubt the note which pur- </p><p>ported to come from McQuade had been </p><p>merely a decoy. I recollected now with </p><p>vividness the interview I had witnessed the </p><p>afternoon before between Li Min and some </p><p>fellow countryman of his at the gateway </p><p>in the hedge back of The Oaks. No doubt </p><p>the crafty Oriental had kept his confed- </p><p>erates in London fully posted as to both </p><p>my movements and those of Sergeant Mc- </p><p>Quade. What on earth they could want </p><p>with me I was unable to imagine. </p><p> I reached out softly with my right hand—</p><p>I had not been bound—and touched a wall, </p><p>hung with heavy embroidered satin. The </p><p>bench upon which I sat was of hard pol- </p><p>ished wood. I reached up quickly, loosed </p><p>the cord which held the bag tightly about </p><p>my neck, and with a swift motion, lifted </p><p>it from my head. The sight I beheld as- </p><p>tounded me.</p><p> I was in a long, low room, the bench upon</p><p>which I sat being at the extreme end of it. </p><p>The walls were hung from end to end with </p><p>bright colored satin, wonderfully embroid- </p><p>ered with birds, flowers, dragons and </p><p>strange Chinese characters. The floor </p><p>was of wood, dark, and polished with the </p><p>walking of countless softly-shod feet. Fac- </p><p>ing me at the far end of the room was a </p><p>great red and gold wooden screen, carved </p><p>and lacquered, and representing some </p><p>mysterious Chinese figures, whether gods </p><p>or demons I could not tell. In the center </p><p>of this screen was an opening, a sort of </p><p>altar, brightly lighted by a large number </p><p>of wax candles, within which hung a repre- </p><p>sentation of the god Buddha, marvelously </p><p>embroidered upon dull red satin, with gold </p><p>and silver threads. Behind the candles </p><p>stood a small gold casket, or shrine, the door </p><p>of which was standing open, disclosing an </p><p>empty interior. The altar in front of the </p><p>candles was covered with a profusion of </p><p>dishes containing flowers, rice and other </p><p>foods. </p><p> Before the altar knelt a tall, gaunt figure,</p><p>his back turned toward me, bowed in </p><p>prayer. He wore a long, dark brown robe, </p><p>girdled loosely about the waist with a </p><p>leather belt, and his gray hair was con- </p><p>fined in a long queue which hung below </p><p>his waist. He took no notice whatever of </p><p>my movements and remained in silent con- </p><p>templation of the picture of the god before </p><p>him. A number of sticks of incense were </p><p>burning in a brass jar upon the altar and </p><p>the room was filled with a thin, waving, </p><p>blue haze, which circled softly around the </p><p>great painted silk lanterns hung from the </p><p>ceiling. </p><p> I felt as though I had been suddenly and</p><p>mysteriously transported from a dark and </p><p>gloomy London street to some wonderful </p><p>temple in the far off city of Pekin. I rubbed </p><p>my eyes, and moved uneasily upon my </p><p>hard bench, but no movement upon the </p><p>part of the silent worshipper indicated that </p><p>he so much as knew of my presence. </p><p>362 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>SUDDENLY a door at my left was </p><p>opened and I observed two dark </p><p>and forbidding-looking Chinamen </p><p>enter, carrying between them a limp and </p><p>apparently lifeless figure, which they placed </p><p>upon the bench beside me. The figure was </p><p>not blindfolded as I had been, and I re- </p><p>coiled, sick and trembling. It was Ser-</p><p>geant McQuade! </p><p> The Chinamen paid no attention to me,</p><p>and quietly withdrew. I placed my hand </p><p>upon the detective’s heart, and was over- </p><p>joyed to find that it still beat. In a few </p><p>moments I saw his eyes slowly open and he </p><p>clutched feebly at his throat. I followed </p><p>his movements and found a heavy cord </p><p>about his neck, so tightly drawn as almost </p><p>to prevent his breathing. This I quickly </p><p>removed and in a few moments he was able </p><p>to speak. His first words, after a glance </p><p>of intense surprise at our surroundings, </p><p>were to ask me why I had sent for him. I </p><p>told him I had not done so. </p><p> “But you asked me to come to this</p><p>address at once—that you had important </p><p>news. I have two men outside, but these </p><p>devils got me before I could blow my whis- </p><p>tle. Not much use to try it now!” he ob- </p><p>served, looking about grimly. </p><p> “I sent you no note,” I replied. “On</p><p>the contrary, I got one from you. That is </p><p>why I am here.” </p><p> “We are both nicely trapped, it seems!”</p><p>he growled. “What have you learned— </p><p>anything? ” </p><p> “Nothing. They took my bunch of keys</p><p>and left me here.” </p><p> “Your keys!” he muttered, softly. “Your</p><p>keys. What could they have wanted with </p><p>them?” He seemed lost in thought. </p><p> Further conversation was interrupted by</p><p>the sudden opening of the door on our left. </p><p>Some score or more of Chinamen crowded </p><p>in and were at once joined by the figure </p><p>of the priest, who rose to his feet and ad- </p><p>vanced toward the center of the room. He </p><p>was a terrible looking old man, his face </p><p>drawn and leathery, his eyes like burning </p><p>coals, his mouth cruel and thin-lipped. All </p><p>the others seemed to pay him deep respect. </p><p>One of their number advanced and handed </p><p>him a large object, which he eagerly grasped. </p><p>It was my Gladstone bag. McQuade and I </p><p>glanced at each other in sudden compre- </p><p>hension. </p><p> The old priest placed the bag upon the</p><p>floor and proceeded to ransack it with </p><p>eager, trembling hands. The others </p><p>crowded about, every face tense and full </p><p>of expectation. Presently his eye fell upon </p><p>the small green cake of soap which I had </p><p>thrown loosely into the bag upon my de- </p><p>parture from The Oaks. He seized it with </p><p>a cry of triumph and, taking a knife from </p><p>his girdle, proceeded with extreme care to </p><p>cut the cake of soap in two. The crowding</p><p>figures about him hung upon his move- </p><p>ments with intense anxiety. The room was </p><p>as silent as death. Suddenly, with a loud </p><p>cry, the priest broke the cake of soap in </p><p>two, and there, within it, in a cavity about </p><p>two inches long, lay the lost Emerald Budd- </p><p>ha, its wonderful color flashing and glowing </p><p>in the light from the lantern above! </p><p> I was absolutely dumb with amazement.</p><p>Undeniably there before me lay the cause </p><p>of Mr. Ashton’s death, yet how it came to </p><p>be hi that cake of soap, and what light its </p><p>presence there threw upon the manner of </p><p>his sudden and tragic end, was beyond my </p><p>comprehension. That it might cause sus- </p><p>picion to point in my direction did not for </p><p>the moment occur to me. </p><p>THE kneeling priest rose to his </p><p>feet with a glad cry and, holding </p><p>the image reverently in the hollow </p><p>of his two hands, advanced toward the </p><p>altar, the others crowding closely about </p><p>him. Arrived at the shrine, he placed the </p><p>figure carefully upon its pedestal within </p><p>the golden casket, and as the light of many </p><p>candles fell full upon it, the whole crowd </p><p>knelt down and began a weird, sing-song </p><p>prayer that must have been a chant of joy, </p><p>or some service of purification, now that </p><p>their long lost deity had been returned to </p><p>them. Presently the strange sounds died </p><p>away, and the various Chinamen placed </p><p>offerings of fruit, flowers and food upon the </p><p>altar. The priest rose, and faced us. I </p><p>had a feeling that our turn was now to come. </p><p> The tall, gaunt figure came close to us and</p><p>examined both our faces minutely. I fancy </p><p>he was the same priest that Ashton had all </p><p>but done for in Ping Yang and, from his look </p><p>of intense hatred and ferocity, I feel sure </p><p>that had he recognized McQuade or myself </p><p>as either his assailant or Major Temple, our </p><p>moments in this life would have been num- </p><p>bered. In answer apparently to thq ques- </p><p>tions of his followers he shook his head </p><p>vigorously. </p><p> Then ensued a heated altercation be-</p><p>The Emerald Buddha </p><p>363 </p><p>tween himself and part of the Chinamen on </p><p>the one hand and the remainder of the crowd </p><p>on the other, the subject of which, I could </p><p>plainly see, was the fate of the detective and </p><p>myself. At last they all turned back to the </p><p>altar, and the priest took from it two pieces </p><p>of wood, slightly curved, some four or five </p><p>inches long, and shaped not unlike the half </p><p>of a banana if it were cut in two lengthwise.</p><p>I saw that they were the Chinese luck- </p><p>sticks, which the petitioner casts before the </p><p>altar, wishing, as he does so, for that prayer </p><p>which he desires the god to grant him. If </p><p>the sticks fall with the flat sides of both up- </p><p>ward, he is lucky—-his prayer is granted; if </p><p>with the flat sides of both downward, his </p><p>prayer is refused. If one stick falls each </p><p>way, there is no decision and the trial is </p><p>made again. </p><p> As the priest took up these sticks from the</p><p>altar a gleam of comprehension passed over </p><p>the faces of the crowd about him. Several </p><p>of their number sprang forward and dragged </p><p>us before the altar. It was evidently their </p><p>intention to leave the matter of our fate in </p><p>the hands of the Buddha, and as I glanced </p><p>at the peaceful and beneficent face of the </p><p>image before me I wondered whether he, or </p><p>blind luck, would control our destinies. </p><p> McQuade they took first. He was led</p><p>directly in front of the altar, and the two </p><p>sticks, placed with the flat sides together, </p><p>were put into his hands. He was then di- </p><p>rected, by signs and a few muttered English </p><p>'wordsy-t'-i cast them upon the slab, and in a </p><p>moment the hardwood sticks clattered be- </p><p>fore the altar. I leaned forward anxiously </p><p>and looked at them. The flat sides of both </p><p>were upward! McQuade was safe. ^ </p><p>THE Chinamen thrust him aside </p><p>angrily, and bent upon me their </p><p>angry glances. I was pushed for- </p><p>ward by many hands, and the luck-sticks </p><p>forced into my unwilling fingers. I had </p><p>never thought much about death, and now </p><p>it approached me in all its grisly terrors. </p><p>McQuade had been spared my agony, for I </p><p>felt sure he did not know the meaning of the </p><p>ceremony through which he had just passed. </p><p>He had thrown dice with death, and won, </p><p>and yet he did not know it. But to me, the </p><p>trial came in all its horrible reality. I knew </p><p>that upon the fall of those bits of wood de- </p><p>pended my life—that within a few seconds </p><p>of time I should either be free, or condemned </p><p>to die by one of those unspeakably horrible </p><p>means that only the Chinese understand and </p><p>delight in. Their deity had been profaned </p><p>and they wanted a victim, and if his down- </p><p>turned thumb claimed me as a sacrifice, I </p><p>knew that no power on earth could save me. </p><p> I shook with nervous dread, not so much</p><p>through fear of death itself as of the manner </p><p>of dying. My hands trembled—I could </p><p>scarcely keep the sticks from falling to the </p><p>floor. Presently I pulled myself together </p><p>and determined to put a brave face upon the</p><p>matter. The Chinamen about me were </p><p>enjoying my sufferings keenly, as I could </p><p>see from the diabolic grins upon their dark </p><p>faces. </p><p> I threw the sticks from me with a quick</p><p>nervous movement, and then almost feared </p><p>to look upon them. At last I did so, and </p><p>what I saw was almost as bad as what I </p><p>feared to see. Instead of the two flat sides </p><p>of the sticks being uppermost, they lay one </p><p>each way, and I was forced to throw again. </p><p>The Chinese were evidently delighted. Any </p><p>method of torture which is prolonged seems </p><p>to please them beyond measure. I have </p><p>heard that one of the most terrible they </p><p>have invented is that of keeping a prisoner </p><p>awake. For days and days sleep is pre- </p><p>vented, and the victim ultimately goes rav- </p><p>ing mad. </p><p> My nerves were too much shaken to pro-</p><p>long the agony. I cast the sticks again upon </p><p>the altar-slab and bent over them with a </p><p>prayer to God. One stick fell at once with </p><p>its flat side uppermost. The other rolled </p><p>over and over until it rested almost at </p><p>the Buddha’s feet. At last it trembled, </p><p>half turned over, then stopped. It, like </p><p>the other, gave the favorable sign! I was </p><p>saved! </p><p> In the sudden relief from the nervous ten-</p><p>sion I almost fell, but the Chinamen, cheated </p><p>of their revenge, gave me no time for any </p><p>such exhibitions of emotion. McQuade and </p><p>I were seized and in a few moments our arms </p><p>were tightly bound behind us and heavy </p><p>bags placed over our heads. We were then </p><p>roughly hurried through a series of rooms, </p><p>once crossing what seemed to be a brick- </p><p>paved court, undoubtedly in the open air, </p><p>then for an interminable distance through </p><p>what seemed to be dark narrow lanes and </p><p>muddy streets, until at last our hoods were </p><p>removed, our feet bound, and we were thrown </p><p>into a narrow area-way, some cotton-waste </p><p>being jammed into our mouths to prevent </p><p>our making any outcry. </p><p>364 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Isa! HERE we were discovered at day- </p><p>break, some four or five hours later, </p><p>nearly frozen to death, by a watch- </p><p>man who released us from our bonds and, </p><p>upon hearing from Sergeant McQuade who </p><p>he was, hastened to find us a cab. </p><p> The detective drove at once to number</p><p>30 Kingsgate Street and, finding his two </p><p>men still on duty, ordered them to enter the </p><p>house. The bell giving no response, Mc-</p><p>Quade and his men burst in the door. The </p><p>house was completely unfurnished. We </p><p>descended into the cellar, but found no signs </p><p>of occupancy anywhere. Evidently there </p><p>was a tunnel somewhere, leading from this </p><p>house to some other in the neighborhood, or </p><p>else the Chioamen had boldly carried us out </p><p>through the backyard and into some house </p><p>adjoining. The Sergeant ordered his men </p><p>to return to Scotland Yard, obtain a relief </p><p>and investigate every house in the block and </p><p>even those on the opposite side of the street. </p><p>I felt no great interest in the capture of the </p><p>Chinamen. They had the Emerald Buddha, </p><p>with a better right to it than ever Ashton </p><p>had, and it seemed useless to bring trouble </p><p>upon any relatives of his by placing in their </p><p>hands so dangerous an article. I was in- </p><p>finitely more concerned in determining who </p><p>was responsible for Robert Ashton’s death. </p><p> I left McQuade and returned to my stu-</p><p>dio, agreeing to meet him there at three the </p><p>same afternoon and return to The Oaks </p><p>with him. Why he wished to go I did not </p><p>then see, but I was only too glad of an op- </p><p>portunity to see Miss Temple again. In </p><p>reply to my questions as to the two China- </p><p>men from Exeter, he informed me that </p><p>they knew nothing of the matter and had </p><p>been discharged. </p><p>CHAPTER XI </p><p>INSPECTOR BURNS’ CONCLUSIONS </p><p>I WAS awaiting McQuade’s arrival, when </p><p>a messenger boy dashed up to my door </p><p>and handed me a telegram. </p><p> Police have discovered weapon in your room</p><p>wrapped in your handkerchief. </p><p>Muriel Temple. </p><p> So strong is the consciousness of innocence</p><p>that even after reading this telegram I had </p><p>no thought of what this new discovery </p><p>might portend for me. It was strange, I </p><p>thought, that I had forgotten the thing. </p><p>I laid it open upon the table, thinking that </p><p>if the Scotland Yard man did not already </p><p>know of the discovery, I would be able to </p><p>inform him of it on his arrival. </p><p> He came on the stroke of three and with</p><p>him a burly, deep-chested, ruddy-faced </p><p>man with twinkling eyes and iron-gray </p><p>whiskers, whom he introduced to me as </p><p>Inspector Bums, of Scotland Yard. </p><p> “I have brought Inspector Burns with</p><p>me,” McQuade said slowly. “He wants to </p><p>ask you a few questions.” </p><p> I turned to the Inspector and smiled.</p><p>“Mr. Morgan,” he began, “about that </p><p>cake of soap which contained the missing</p><p>jewel—will you be so good as to tell Ser- </p><p>geant McQuade and myself how it hap- </p><p>pened to be in your possession? ” </p><p>“Certainly,” I replied, without hesita- </p><p>tion, and outlined the facts. </p><p> “Mr. Morgan,” inquired Inspector</p><p>Burns, when I had finished, “ why, since you </p><p>were pretending to assist Sergeant McQuade </p><p>by every means in your power, did you fail </p><p>to disclose to him the facts you have just </p><p>related? Did you have any reason to sus- </p><p>pect that the jewel was hidden in' the; cake, </p><p>of soap? ” </p><p> “None whatever. I did not mention the</p><p>matter to the Sergeant because it seemed </p><p>too vague and unimportant.” </p><p> The Inspector frowned. “You com-</p><p>mitted a grave error. I dislike to imply </p><p>that it might have been anything worse.” </p><p>I began to feel indignant at the tone and </p><p>manner in which he was conducting his </p><p>cross-questioning. </p><p> “Is it not true, Mr. Morgan,” he asked</p><p>suddenly, “that Miss Temple was violently </p><p>opposed to any marriage with Mr. Ashton, </p><p>and that either his death, or the abstracting </p><p>of the jewel which was to have been the </p><p>price paid by him for her hand, would have </p><p>been of great benefit to her? ” </p><p> “I suppose they would,” I answered</p><p>sulkily, “if you put it that way.” </p><p> “ Did not Miss Temple ask you to assist</p><p>her in preventing this marriage, Mr. Mor- </p><p>gan, and did you not promise to help her in </p><p>every way in your power?” </p><p> “This is absurd!” I cried. “You will be</p><p>accusing me of murdering Mr. Ashton </p><p>next!” </p><p> “We only know, so far, that the jewel for</p><p>which Mr. Ashton was murdered has been </p><p>found in your possession!” </p><p> The significant way in which he uttered</p><p>The Emerald Buddha </p><p>365 </p><p>these words thrilled me with a vague sense </p><p>of alarm. There upon the table, before </p><p>Sergeant McQuade, lay Miss Temple’s tele- </p><p>gram. It was open, and I felt sure he had </p><p>already read it. My mind seemed con- </p><p>fused, my brain on fire. The Inspector </p><p>turned to McQuade. “Sergeant,” he said, </p><p>“you have the handkerchief in question </p><p>with you, I believe.” </p><p> McQuade drew from his pocket the folded</p><p>handkerchief and requested me to examine </p><p>its surface with a magnifying-glass. I did </p><p>so, and observed that it was covered with </p><p>minute particles of some green substance.</p><p> “Do you see anything?” asked the In-</p><p>spector. </p><p> “Yes,” I replied. “The handkerchief is</p><p>full.of fine green specks, but I can not </p><p>imagine what they are.” </p><p> “They are bits of soap, Mr. Morgan.”</p><p> “Soap?”</p><p> “Exactly.” The Inspector looked at me</p><p>keenly. “ Has it not occurred to you, Mr. </p><p>Morgan, that it was first necessary to cut it </p><p>in two and hollow out a space in the inte- </p><p>rior? Is it not also quite evident that bits of </p><p>soap must have been carefully collected </p><p>upon some object, this handkerchief for </p><p>instance, and subsequently thrown away, </p><p>leaving the minute particles that you see </p><p>still clinging to its surface?” </p><p> “Yes,” I replied, dazed, “but who?”</p><p> “THAT, Mr. Morgan, is just what</p><p>Slip . we are trying to find out. It hardly </p><p>seems likely that Mr. Ashton would </p><p>have gone to all this trouble, although it is </p><p>possible, since he had reason, after his quar- </p><p>rel with Major Temple, to fear an attempt </p><p>to gain possession of the jewel. If he did, </p><p>how does it happen that he used Miss Tem- </p><p>ple’s handkerchief for the purpose? He </p><p>may have found it upon the, floor and so </p><p>utilized it, but it seems unlikely.” </p><p> “What then, seems more likely?” I asked</p><p>hotly. “Would the murderer have gone to </p><p>all that trouble to get the stone and then </p><p>have left it behind? ” </p><p>“Possibly, Mr. Morgan, to have been </p><p>recovered at leisure—as you, indeed, hap- </p><p>pened to recover it. Such a jewel would </p><p>not be a good thing to have in one’s posses- </p><p>Tunediately after the murder!” </p><p>t it would have taken fifteen or </p><p>minutes,” I objected, “ and we burst </p><p>door within less than ten minutes </p><p>■&gt; time Mr. Ashton’s cry was heard.” </p><p> “The alarm was given by you, Mr. Mor-</p><p>gan. You alone heard Mr. Ashton’s cry. </p><p>Whether you heard it at six o’clock, or five, </p><p>or four rests upon your word alone. We do </p><p>not accuse you, remember—we are trying to </p><p>arrive at the truth. The facts we have just </p><p>stated, coupled with Miss Temple’s refusal </p><p>to explain her early expedition from the </p><p>house that morning, all point to something </p><p>we do not yet understand. We are con- </p><p>vinced of one thing: that the Chinaman did </p><p>not commit the murder, for he would have </p><p>taken the stone along with him.” </p><p> “I do not agree with you there,” I said.</p><p>“Mr. Ashton may have hidden the jewel </p><p>himself, and then the Chinaman, after com-</p><p>mitting the murder, may have been unable </p><p>to find it. That would account for Li </p><p>Min’s subsequent search of the room, and </p><p>his confederates’ actions when they began </p><p>to suspect that the emerald was hidden </p><p>within it.” </p><p> “You are right in what you say, Mr.</p><p>Morgan, if Mr. Ashton hid the jewel him- </p><p>self. But the subsequent actions of Li </p><p>Min and lus confederates are equally ex- </p><p>plainable upon the theory that they had </p><p>nothing to do with the murder whatever and </p><p>were merely attempting to steal the jewel </p><p>at the first opportunity.” </p><p> I made no reply. They seemed to be</p><p>weaving a net of circumstantial evidence </p><p>about me that, try as I would, I did not </p><p>seem able to break through. </p><p> “We now come to another curious fact,”</p><p>continued the Inspector. “The weapon </p><p>with which this murder was apparently </p><p>committed was found this morning locked </p><p>in a drawer in the room you occupied at </p><p>Major Temple’s house. It was wrapped </p><p>in a handkerchief marked with your initials. </p><p>Can you tell us how it came to be there?” </p><p>I turned to the Inspector with a bitter </p><p>laugh. “I can tell you,” I replied, “but I </p><p>presume you will not believe me. I put the </p><p>weapon, which was a brass-headed poker, </p><p>there myself. I found it on the lawn out- </p><p>side of Mr. Ashton’s window the day before </p><p>yesterday.” </p><p> “ Why did you also conceal this important</p><p>piece of evidence from Sergeant McQuade? ” </p><p>demanded the Inspector in a stern voice. </p><p> I felt like a fool, and looked like one as</p><p>well, I fear. “I forgot it,” I mumbled in </p><p>confusion. </p><p> “You forgot it! Can you expect a sane</p><p>man to believe any such folly as that? ” </p><p>366 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “ Folly, or not,” I replied, “it is the truth!</p><p>I intended to show it privately to Sergeant </p><p>McQuade. He was in Exeter at the time </p><p>and I placed it in the drawer for safe keep- </p><p>ing; when he returned that evening, it was </p><p>just in time to listen to Major Temple’s </p><p>story of his experiences in China, and when </p><p>he had finished, it was close to midnight and </p><p>the matter had completely slipped my mind. </p><p>The inquest the following morning took my </p><p>entire attention, and after that the sudden </p><p>arrest of Li Min, and our departure for </p><p>London. You know what has occurred </p><p>since. I had forgotten the matter com- </p><p>pletely until I received this telegram from</p><p>Miss Temple not half an hour before you </p><p>came.” I took the dispatch from the table </p><p>and handed it to the Inspector, who read it </p><p>with interest. </p><p> “Why did Miss Temple send you this?”</p><p>he inquired suddenly. </p><p> “I do not know—I suppose she thought</p><p>it would be of interest to me.” </p><p> “Did it not occur to you that it might be</p><p>in the nature of a warning?” </p><p> Again I saw a chasm yawning before me.</p><p>“Miss Temple has no reason to suspect </p><p>me of any part in the matter,” I replied. </p><p>“ Do you think it likely that, if I had com- </p><p>mitted the murder, I could have left such </p><p>damning evidence where the police would </p><p>have been certain to discover it, and wrapped </p><p>in my own handkerchief? I am as innocent </p><p>of any complicity in Mr. Ashton’s murder </p><p>as you are!” </p><p>“I HAVE no objection, Mr. Mor- </p><p>gan, to outlining a theory of the </p><p>murder which seems to fit the facts </p><p>as we know them. Miss Temple, desperate </p><p>and detesting Ashton, retired to her room, </p><p>but could not sleep. At some hour later she </p><p>went to Ashton’s room. He refused to give </p><p>up her letter, they quarreled and in her rage </p><p>she grasped the poker and struck him with </p><p>it. Believing him only stunned, she se- </p><p>cured the jewel, but fearing to take it from </p><p>the room and wishing only to prevent Mr. </p><p>Ashton from using it, she hid it in the cake </p><p>of soap. The pieces, collected upon her </p><p>handkerchief, were thrown out of the win- </p><p>dow. But on feeling Ashton’s heart, she </p><p>found it very weak, and to destroy the evi- </p><p>dence, she threw the poker out of the win- </p><p>dow, and hurriedly left the room, forgetting </p><p>the handkerchief in her agitation. </p><p> Toward morning she decided to flee and</p><p>changed her clothes and shoes, but once </p><p>more went to Ashton’s room, to assure her- </p><p>self that he no longer lived. In doing this </p><p>she awoke you, by accident or design. She </p><p>threw herself upon your mercy, and you </p><p>agreed to stand by her, advised against </p><p>running away, but suggested that she go </p><p>down and get the poker so that it might be </p><p>replaced or otherwise disposed of. You </p><p>meanwhile entered the room, bolted the </p><p>door on the inside, and left by the window. </p><p>It is probable that you examined the body, </p><p>your hand became stained with blood, and </p><p>you rested it upon the sill while closing the </p><p>window. You then reentered by the hall </p><p>window, meeting Miss Temple and taking </p><p>the poker from her.</p><p> “You placed it in your room, meanwhile</p><p>urging her to change her dress and shoes. A </p><p>little later you aroused the house and re- </p><p>bolted the window while Major Temple was </p><p>not observing you. You later secured the </p><p>soap containing the jewel. You no doubt </p><p>intended to replace the poker, but no oppor- </p><p>tunity occurred.” </p><p> He glanced at me triumphantly. I</p><p>laughed, though with little mirth. “Why </p><p>don’t you simply say I killed Ashton and </p><p>put the weapon in my dresser, and leave </p><p>Miss Temple out of it entirely?” I said. </p><p>“It’s equally plausible.” </p><p> “Possibly so, though that would account</p><p>for neither the handkerchief nor Miss Tem- </p><p>ple’s leaving the house that morning.” </p><p> “She has already accounted for t&gt;«* one,</p><p>she can readily do so for the other,” I re- </p><p>plied. </p><p> “That we shall see,” said the Inspector,</p><p>rising from his chair. “ We will go to Exe- </p><p>ter at once, and question Miss Temple.” </p><p>CHAPTER Xn </p><p>A DISAPPEARANCE </p><p>INSPECTOR BURNS and his companion </p><p>had left me to myself on the trip </p><p>down, and I turned over in my mind the </p><p>curious .events of the past forty-eight hours. </p><p>My conversation with-Miss Temple, on the </p><p>night of the murder had, I presumed, been </p><p>overheard by one of tie servants, frop- </p><p>whom it had been wormed by McQi </p><p>men during my absence. But the tl </p><p>that Muriel Temple could be guil' </p><p>preposterous. I knew that I was </p><p>diced in her favor, that I had come </p><p>The Emerald Buddha	367</p><p>her, that nothing could ever change it, but </p><p>only two real bits of evidence connected </p><p>her with Ashton’s death—one, the presence </p><p>of. her handkerchief in the room and the </p><p>curious use to which it had been put; the </p><p>other, her early morning expedition from </p><p>the house and her sudden return. If she </p><p>would but explain the latter, I felt sure </p><p>Inspector Burns’ theory would fall to the </p><p>ground like a house of cards. Why she </p><p>refused to do so, I could not imagine— </p><p>that she had some strong compelling reason, </p><p>I felt sure. What? Was she shielding her </p><p>father? I could not believe that even for </p><p>her father’s sake she would allow an inno- </p><p>cent person to be accused. </p><p> On arriving at The Oaks, Inspector Burns</p><p>asked to see the scene of the murder and to </p><p>interview Miss Temple “My daughter has </p><p>retired, I fancy,” the Major said. “I have</p><p>not seen her since dinner, but I will send </p><p>her word.” He led the way, his mastiff, </p><p>Boris, bringing up the rear. We first en- </p><p>tered the room I had occupied. The drawer </p><p>was soon unlocked and there lay the </p><p>wretched poker wrapped in my handker- </p><p>chief, just as I had left it. Inspector Burns </p><p>took it up. “Hardly heavy enough to </p><p>fracture a man’s skull,” he muttered. </p><p>“What do you know about this thing?” he </p><p>inquired of Major Temple. </p><p> The Major looked puzzled. He had not</p><p>seen the weapon before. I wondered how </p><p>Miss Temple came to know of it, in order </p><p>to notify me. </p><p> “ It is half of an old poker,” he replied,</p><p>“that I gave to the gardener for a stake in </p><p>laying out his flower-beds. It had been </p><p>roughly ground to a point, as you see, so </p><p>that it might be readily thrust into the </p><p>earth. The last time I saw it he was using </p><p>it upon the pathways about the house.” </p><p> “Then it was not in the green room?”</p><p>asked the Inspector. </p><p> “Never, to my knowledge,” said Major</p><p>Temple. “There is no fireplace in that </p><p>room!” </p><p> The Inspector closed the drawer with a</p><p>slam. “Then if this was the w'eappn the </p><p>murderer used,” he -said, rather lamely, </p><p>“he must have'taken it along with him.” </p><p> .WE ALL adjourned to the green</p><p> room which the Inspector went over</p><p> vithout discovering anything new.</p><p> ; seemed strangely oppressed by</p><p> undings, but after sniffing about</p><p>nervously with a low whine, crawled under </p><p>the bed and lay quiet. We were on the </p><p>point of leaving when the maid rushed in </p><p>and, calling Major Temple aside, handed </p><p>him a sealed envelope. The Major passed </p><p>his hand nervously over his forehead, and </p><p>turned to us. “Gentlemen,” he said, in a </p><p>frightened voice, “ Miss Temple can not be </p><p>found!” </p><p> We all turned toward him in intense sur-</p><p>prise. “What does this mean?” asked the </p><p>Inspector. “Where is she?” </p><p> “This note, addressed to me, was lying</p><p>upon her writing-desk,” replied the Major </p><p>in a daze. </p><p> “Read it,” commanded the Inspector,</p><p>as we all hastily adjourned to the library. </p><p> Major Temple opened the letter with</p><p>trembling fingers; then read aloud: </p><p> My Dear Father: I am going to London to see</p><p>Mr. Morgan. They suspect him of the murder. J </p><p>overheard the police talking about it this morning.</p><p>I do not know what to do. I can not let an inno- </p><p>cent person suffer. It may be better for me to </p><p>remain away altogether. If I must speak I can only </p><p>ask for forgiveness. </p><p>Muriel. </p><p> If the earth had opened up and engulfed</p><p>me I could not have been more astounded. </p><p>I glanced at her father—he seemed shrunken </p><p>and old, his head bowed upon his breast. </p><p>Could he—I refused to think—yet he </p><p>feared either for himself, or, God help me, </p><p>for her. No consideration for any one else </p><p>could have so terribly affected him. i </p><p>looked at the cold, accusing faces of the two </p><p>Scotland Yard men and groaned inwardly. </p><p>In a moment the Inspector spoke. “Have </p><p>you a telephone in the house, Major Tem- </p><p>ple? ” he asked. </p><p> “Yes,” answered the Major, rousing him-</p><p>self from his lethargy. “In the hall, near </p><p>the foot of the staircase.” </p><p> The Inspector nodded to McQuade, who</p><p>arose without a word and left the room. </p><p>The net was fast closing about some one, </p><p>but about whom I could not yet see. </p><p> “ Mr. Morgan, have you anything to say</p><p>in explanation of this letter?” I heard </p><p>Major Temple asking me. </p><p> “Miss Temple writes as though she be-</p><p>lieved you would understand what she </p><p>means,” I replied. “7 certainly do not.” </p><p> “I?” cried the Major. “It’s absolute</p><p>nonsense to me!” He threw up his hands </p><p>in absolute dismay. If this were acting, I </p><p>thought, it could not be better done. </p><p> • *</p><p>368	Adventure-</p><p> “You have heard my theory of the mur-</p><p>der, Mr. Morgan,” said the Inspector </p><p>coldly. “The note is plain enough. She </p><p>wail confess before she will allow you to bear </p><p>the penalty of her crime.” </p><p> “ Her crime! ” Major Temple was on his</p><p>feet in an instant, his eyes blazing. “Your </p><p>words are ill chosen, sir!” Poor man, he </p><p>did not know of the damning circumstances </p><p>the Inspector had so cleverly woven into </p><p>his accusing theory. </p><p> “Not at all, Major Temple,” replied the</p><p>imperturbable Inspector. “Sergeant Mc- </p><p>Quade is at present ordering the arrest of </p><p>your daughter. She will be apprehended </p><p>as soon as she arrives in London, and we </p><p>will hear her story at the Magistrate’s hear- </p><p>ing to-morrow.” </p><p> “But,” I cried, in consternation, “this</p><p>is ridiculous! Don’t you see that-” </p><p> “ Mr. Morgan, the time has come for the</p><p>truth. It is my painful duty to place you </p><p>under arrest!” </p><p> “On what charge?” I demanded hotly.</p><p>“For complicity in Robert Ashton’s mur- </p><p>der!” he replied, and placed his hand upon </p><p>my shoulder. </p><p>I SPENT a dreary enough night in </p><p>the library, sometimes talking with </p><p>McQuade, who dozed upon a couch, </p><p>but for the most part engaged on the mad- </p><p>dening problem of Robert Ashton’s death. </p><p> I fell into a doze toward morning, and</p><p>awoke trembling, and listened. Far off I </p><p>heard the mournful howling of a dog, a </p><p>series of low, unearthly howls that would </p><p>die slowly away only to be once more re- </p><p>peated. It seemed like the moaning of an </p><p>animal in great pain. Presently, as I lis- </p><p>tened, there came a great yelp, and there- </p><p>after silence. The matter had passed from </p><p>my mind by the time our coffee was brought </p><p>to us, and a little later we set out for the </p><p>town. </p><p> On arrival, I made my first acquaintance</p><p>with the interior of a cell. McQuade in- </p><p>formed me I would be taken before the </p><p>Magistrate for a hearing at ten o’clock. 1' </p><p>asked whether he had received any word </p><p>regarding Miss Temple, and he told me she </p><p>would arrive during the forenoon. Major </p><p>Temple and the servants were to come in </p><p>to the hearing, at which they would be </p><p>wanted as witnesses. I secured a morning </p><p>paper and resigned myself to a tedious wait </p><p>of somewhat over two hours. I was </p><p>strangely calm and self-possessed. The </p><p>ordeal through which I was about to pass </p><p>seemed to give me slight concern. But for </p><p>Miss Temple I feared greatly. </p><p>CHAPTER XIII </p><p>THE TRIAL </p><p>TX7HENI was led forth and placed in the </p><p>V	V dock I gazed at the crowded benches</p><p>before me with a dull sense of annoyance. </p><p>I looked up at the Magistrate and found him </p><p>to be a little red-faced man, with a stern, but </p><p>not unkind expression. The finding of the </p><p>coroner’s inquest was first read, and then </p><p>Major Temple was placed upon the witness </p><p>stand. The old gentleman looked more </p><p>shrunken and old than ever—his face was </p><p>yellow, his eyes hollow and heavy from want </p><p>of sleep, his hands trembling with excite- </p><p>ment. I could well understand his agita- </p><p>tion, with his daughter under arrest and </p><p>hurrying to Exeter to undergo that most </p><p>terrible of all ordeals, a hearing on a charge </p><p>of murder. The Magistrate began his ex-</p><p>amination with characteristic incisiveness. </p><p> “Major Temple,” he said, “you are here</p><p>as a witness in the case of Mr. Owen Morgan </p><p>charged with complicity in the murder of </p><p>Robert Ashton.” </p><p> The Major bowed, but remained silent.</p><p>Then followed some preliminary questions </p><p>establishing the facts that I had been a </p><p>stranger to all of them, that I had seen and </p><p>knew the value of the Emerald Buddha, and </p><p>that the Major had insisted, against his </p><p>daughter’s will, upon carrying out the mar- </p><p>riage agreement with Ashton. </p><p> “The securing of the jewel, then, from Mr.</p><p>Ashton, would have released her from the </p><p>arrangement? ” </p><p> “If Mr. Ashton had not had it he could</p><p>not have carried out his agreement, of </p><p>course.” </p><p> “At what time did you retire on the night</p><p>of the murder? ” </p><p> “Shortly before midnight.”</p><p> Further questioning brought out the</p><p>events of that night as the reader already </p><p>knows them, up to our finding Ashton on </p><p>the floor dead.	itt</p><p> “Could Mr. Morgan have fasteji</p><p>window without your knowing it?”; </p><p> “I suppose he could—I paid littl’</p><p>tion to him.”	‘</p><p> “ What happened then? ”</p><p>K </p><p>The' Emerald Buddha	369</p><p> “After our examination of the room we</p><p>closed and locked the door. We then had </p><p>some coffee, after which Mr. Morgan went </p><p>into Exeter and notified the police.” </p><p>“Major Temple, there is a window at the </p><p>end of the hallway in the west wing, which </p><p>opens on to the roof over the porch. Is this </p><p>window usually bolted?” </p><p> “Always. I generally see to it myself. I</p><p>have a valuable collection and am afraid of </p><p>thieves.” </p><p> “Did you do so that night?”</p><p> “I did. I saw that it was bolted after</p><p>seeing Mr. Ashton to his room and before </p><p>retiring to my own.” </p><p> This comprised the bulk of Major Tem-</p><p>ple’s testimony. He was followed by Gib- </p><p>son, who corroborated all that his master </p><p>had said, and similar testimony was given </p><p>by the maid. There was a feature of the </p><p>latter’s testimony, however, which bore </p><p>more directly upon the case. She had been, </p><p>it seems, on the landing of the main stair- </p><p>way, after dinner, waiting for Miss Temple </p><p>to come up-stairs. It was her habit to sit</p><p>there, she said, while waiting for Miss </p><p>Temple. In this position she was almost </p><p>directly above the latter and myself during </p><p>the conversation we had had immediately </p><p>after dinner on the night of the tragedy. </p><p>She testified that she had heard Miss Tem- </p><p>ple say in a loud and agitated voice that she </p><p>would “never marry Robert Ash ton, never!” </p><p>and asked me to help her, and that I had </p><p>replied that she could depend upon me abso- </p><p>lutely. Immediately after this her mistress </p><p>had come up-stairs and gone to her room. </p><p> “ Did you accompany her to her room? ”</p><p>asked the Magistrate? </p><p> “No, sir. She told me as how she in-</p><p>tended to read until quite late, sir, and that </p><p>I could go to bed at once, as she would not </p><p>require my assistance.” </p><p> “Was this unusual?”</p><p> “ It was, a bit, sir. I most always helped</p><p>her to undress, sir.” </p><p> “And you went to your room at once?”</p><p> “Yes, sir. I did, sir, and to sleep, sir.”</p><p> “ How were you awakened? ”</p><p> “ I heard some one crying ‘ Help! Help! ’</p><p> 1 threw on some clothes as quick as I could,</p><p> 1 ran out into the hall. Then I seen</p><p> .ter run into the hallway of the west</p><p> id Gibson after him, and I follows</p><p> 'vfter that, sir, I was sent for a</p><p>timony of the other servants was </p><p>similar to that of Gibson and the maid. </p><p>They had heard some one crying for help, </p><p>and had rushed into the hall. </p><p>SERGEANT McQUADE’S testi- </p><p>mony was, in some ways, the most </p><p>interesting of all. I began to see </p><p>that this astute gentleman had by no means </p><p>been as frank with me as I had been </p><p>with him. He testified to finding Miss </p><p>Temple’s handkerchief in Mr. Ashton’s </p><p>room, and to finding the window at the end </p><p>of the hallway unbolted. He produced pho- </p><p>tographs and measurements of the bloody </p><p>hand-print found upon Mr. Ashton’s window- </p><p>sill and compared them with measurements </p><p>made of my hands earlier in the day. </p><p> It appeared that, while the hand-print</p><p>was small and too smeared for abso- </p><p>lute identification, it could readily have </p><p>been made by my hand, which is rather be- </p><p>low medium size. He testified that he </p><p>found similar marks upon the sill of the hall </p><p>window, pointing inward; also scratches in </p><p>the paint, evidently made by some one </p><p>climbing through the window from without; </p><p>and foot-prints in the thin, wet mold on the </p><p>porch roof, made by some one either wear-</p><p>ing soft slippers or in his stocking feet. He </p><p>found traces of this mold on the white sill of </p><p>the hall window, and traced prints of it upon </p><p>the polished wooden floor of the hallway, </p><p>from the window as far as the doorway of </p><p>my room. </p><p> He could not find any prints of this</p><p>nature within my room, nor could he say </p><p>that the person making them [did not gc </p><p>beyond my room, but only that the foot- </p><p>prints could not be traced beyond my door. </p><p>The walking of many feet in the hallway </p><p>between Mr. Ashton’s door and mine had </p><p>obliterated the marks and prevented his </p><p>tracing them beyond that point, if they had </p><p>gone beyond. They were small foot-prints, </p><p>and somewhat indistinct, yet showing </p><p>clearly as faint, dull patches upon the pol- </p><p>ished floor—clearly a man’s foot-prints, </p><p>though smaller than the average. Meas- </p><p>urements proved conclusively that they </p><p>could readily have been made by me. I sat </p><p>in the dock amazed—wondering if by any </p><p>chance I had suddenly developed somnam- </p><p>bulistic tendencies and had performed these </p><p>various acts while walking in my sleep. I </p><p>felt that both the Magistrate and the crowd </p><p>in the court-room were coming to regard </p><p>me as an extremely dangerous character. </p><p>370 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The Sergeant showed conclusively that no</p><p>one had descended from the porch roof, and </p><p>spoke of the woman’s foot-prints in the </p><p>gravel path from the corner of the porch to </p><p>the main entrance. He then took up our </p><p>trip to London, explaining that the China- </p><p>men had no doubt been uncertain whether </p><p>I had the stone or had turned it over to him, </p><p>and to avoid taking chances had decoyed us </p><p>both. He referred to my offers of assistance </p><p>in unraveling the case, and my failure to </p><p>mention to him my suspicions regarding the </p><p>Oriental perfume, or my taking of the cake </p><p>of soap from the green room. He de- </p><p>scribed Li Min’s attempt to steal my satchel. </p><p>Finally he spoke of the finding of the emer- </p><p>ald in the cake of soap in my satchel and the </p><p>weapon in the drawer of the dresser in my </p><p>room. </p><p> I arose to be examined with a sinking</p><p>heart. I knew that before now in the his- </p><p>tory of criminal trials many an innocent </p><p>man had gone protesting to the gallows, and </p><p>already I felt sure that, unless Miss Temple’s </p><p>testimony was decidedly convincing, I was </p><p>certain of being held for trial as either an </p><p>accomplice or the principal in Robert Ash-</p><p>ton’s murder. </p><p> I told my story without any hitch or hesi-</p><p>tation. If my reasons for taking the cake </p><p>of soap from Ashton’s room seemed weak, </p><p>I could only inform the Magistrate that they </p><p>were, nevertheless, the ones which had actu- </p><p>ated me If my failure to speak of the mat- </p><p>ter to McQuade seemed suspicious, I could </p><p>only say in reply that I had not thought it </p><p>of sufficient importance to mention to him. </p><p>I testified that I had lasfe seen Miss Temple, </p><p>on that fatal night, when she bade me good- </p><p>night in the lower hall, and that I did not </p><p>see her again until the next morning when </p><p>she came into the hall in answer to my </p><p>cries. I felt I had made a favorable im- </p><p>pression, but I realized that the stem facts </p><p>brought out by McQuade would need more </p><p>than a. favorable impression to overcome </p><p>them. </p><p> At the conclusion of my testimony I re-</p><p>quested that Li Min be called to corroborate </p><p>my testimony as to the removal of the cake </p><p>of soap from the green room. The China- </p><p>man was already in the witness-room, but </p><p>when brought into court maintained a stolid </p><p>silence, and even the most strenuous efforts </p><p>of an interpreter failed to elicit from him </p><p>a single syllable. It was at this point that </p><p>the court adjourned for luncheon. </p><p>CHAPTER XIV </p><p>MISS TEMPLE’S TESTIMONY </p><p>1 REALIZED fully that the testimony of </p><p>the morning had been heavily against </p><p>me, but I would have gladly endured that </p><p>and much more, could I have spared Muriel </p><p>the coming ordeal. That she had evidence </p><p>of importance to put before the court I well </p><p>knew, yet whom could it possibly involve </p><p>but herself? The Chinaman she could bav e </p><p>no possible motive for screening, and her </p><p>father clearly could not have committed the </p><p>murder. The more I thought, the more </p><p>I realized that logic pointed its inexorable </p><p>finger at her, and the more strongly did the </p><p>love I felt for her tell me the impossibility </p><p>of such a conclusion. </p><p> I can not express the tenderness, the love,</p><p>with which this girl, in our few brief meet- </p><p>ings, had inspired me—I longed to take her </p><p>into my arms and comfort her, and tell her </p><p>that the whole thing was but a wretched, </p><p>miserable dream. Yet it needed but a </p><p>glance at the stone walls about me, the steel </p><p>grating of my door, and the untasted food </p><p>which stood upon the cot at my side, to as- </p><p>sure me that this was indeed no dream, but </p><p>a very cold and stern reality.</p><p> It was close on to two o’clock when I was</p><p>once more taken back to the court-room. </p><p>Miss Temple was nowhere to be seen. </p><p>Major Temple sat in his former seat, pale </p><p>and still. Presently there was a stir in the </p><p>room and I saw Muriel entering, with Ser- </p><p>geant McQuade at her side and Inspector </p><p>Bums following them. My heart sank as I </p><p>saw how terribly pale and distressed she </p><p>looked and with what shrinking she met </p><p>the gaze of the many eyes now focused </p><p>upon her. Her own sought the face of her </p><p>father. He half rose, as though, to speak, </p><p>then sank back into his seat and covered </p><p>his eyes with his hand. She did not see </p><p>me at all—probably because I was so close </p><p>to her. </p><p> The Magistrate rapped upon the desk to</p><p>still the rising buzz of conversation among </p><p>the spectators, and began his examination, </p><p>quickly carrying it up through my convert </p><p>sation with Miss Temple the evening ,jr </p><p>the murder. </p><p> “What did you do then?”</p><p> “Iretired to myroom, dismissed t</p><p>and threw myself fully dressed t </p><p>bed.” </p><p>The Emerald Buddha </p><p>37’ </p><p> “What time was it?”</p><p> “Close to ten o’clock. I beard the hall</p><p>clock strike the hour shortly aftdr'I reached </p><p>my room.” </p><p> “ Did you go to sleep? ”</p><p> “No. I thought and thought about the</p><p>terrible situation I was in. At last I heard </p><p>my father and Mr. Ashton come up-stairs, </p><p>and shortly after heard my father retire to </p><p>his own room. I made up my mind to make </p><p>a last appeal to Mr. Ashton—to tell him </p><p>under no circumstances to deliver the jewel </p><p>to my father under the impression that I </p><p>would marry him—that I would refuse to </p><p>do so. I wanted also to ask him to give me </p><p>back my letter and to release me from my </p><p>unwilling promise. </p><p> He opened his door to my knock, and,</p><p>fearing I might be seen or heard by some </p><p>one if I remained standing in the hall, I </p><p>entered. Mr. Ashton had evidently been </p><p>examining the emerald, for I saw it upon a </p><p>table. He had a pen in his hand, and was </p><p>making a copy, upon a small piece of paper, </p><p>of the curious symbol engraved on the base </p><p>of the image. After stating my case in a </p><p>few words, I demanded my letter. He was </p><p>very angry and at first refused to believe </p><p>that I was in earnest. Then he became very</p><p>brutal and refused to release me. He even </p><p>went so far as to attempt to embrace me, </p><p>and only by threatening to rouse the house </p><p>with my screams did I succeed in making </p><p>him desist. Then I hurriedly left the room.” </p><p>“Did you drop your handkerchief?” </p><p> “1 must have done so. The one found in</p><p>the room belonged to me.” </p><p> “Did you by any chance observe whether</p><p>or not any of the windows in the room were </p><p>open?” </p><p> “I did. They were all closed. I noticed</p><p>it instinctively, because when I first en- </p><p>tered the room I was conscious of the </p><p>heavy, oppressive atmosphere of the place </p><p>and, knowing the room had been long </p><p>closed,, wondered that Mr. Ashton had not </p><p>opened the windows. I suppose it was be- </p><p>cause his long stay in the East had rendered </p><p>him sensitive to our cold English weather.” </p><p>“ After you left Mr. Ashton’s room what </p><p>did you do?” </p><p> I retired to my own room, partially un-</p><p> ’-ed and again threw myself upon the</p><p> d you sleep? ”</p><p> I could not.”</p><p> did you again leave your room? ”</p><p> “About five o’clock. I had been tliinking</p><p>all night about leaving the house. I felt </p><p>that after the scene the night before with </p><p>Mr. Ashton I could not endure another </p><p>meeting with him. I got up, put on a walk- </p><p>ing-suit and boots and, throwing a few </p><p>things into a satchel, stole quietly down- </p><p>stairs, opened the front door and went out.” </p><p>“Where did you go?” </p><p> “I—I set out across the lawns, taking a</p><p>short-cut to the main road to the town.” </p><p>?a£= 1 OBSERVED that Miss Temple </p><p>imul was lowing a greater and greater </p><p>appearance of distress as the Magis- </p><p>trate pursued inexorably the line of ques- </p><p>tioning which would lead her to the dis- </p><p>closures I knew she feared to make. Her </p><p>face, white and drawn, twitched pathetic- </p><p>ally under the stress of her emotions; she </p><p>spoke in a low, penetrating voice, little more </p><p>than a whisper, yet so silent was the court- </p><p>room that what she said was audible to its </p><p>furthermost corner. As I gazed at her in </p><p>silent pity I heard the Magistrate ask the </p><p>next question: </p><p> “ How far did you go? ”</p><p> “I went—I—I think it must have been</p><p>about thirty yards—as far as the corner of </p><p>the house.” </p><p> “The corner of the west wing?”</p><p> “Yes.” Her voice was growing more and</p><p>more faint. </p><p> “Why did you not go farther?”</p><p> “ I—I saw somebody upon the roof of the</p><p>porch.” </p><p> “Was it light?”</p><p> “There was a faint light in the sky. I</p><p>walked over toward the path, and looked up </p><p>at the porch roof.” </p><p> “ What did you see? ”</p><p> “I saw some one get out of the window</p><p>from the hall, on to the roof. I—I—the)’ </p><p>walked over to Mr. Ashton’s window and </p><p>seemed to be trying to open it-” </p><p> “Who was it?” The crucial question of</p><p>all that had been asked her came like the </p><p>snapping of a lash, and as she compre- </p><p>hended it, her face became flushed, then </p><p>ghastly pale. </p><p> “I—I—Must I answer that question?”</p><p> “You must.”</p><p> “ But—I—I can not-” She burst into</p><p>sobs, and buried her face in her hands. </p><p> The Magistrate looked at her sternly.</p><p>“Miss Temple,” he said, “evidence has </p><p>been given here this morning which points </p><p>372 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>strongly toward a prisoner in this court as </p><p>the person guilty of Mr. Ashton’s death. </p><p>Your answer to my question may confirm or </p><p>disprove his guilt. I direct you to answer </p><p>my question at once! Whom did you see </p><p>upon the porch roof? ” </p><p> Miss Temple looked despairingly about</p><p>her, rose with a ghastly look from her chair, </p><p>and, facing the Magistrate, said: “It—it— </p><p>oh, my God—it was my father!” Then </p><p>collapsed limply against the rail. </p><p> Major Temple rose from his seat and</p><p>stood white and trembling. “Muriel!” he </p><p>cried, in a voice filled with incredulous </p><p>amazement and horror which rang through- </p><p>out the whole room. </p><p> I sprang forward with outstretched arms,</p><p>but Inspector Burns was before me. He </p><p>placed Miss Temple tenderly in her chair. </p><p>She was unconscious. </p><p>CHAPTER XV </p><p>THE VENGEANCE OF BUDDHA </p><p>T X7HEN Miss Temple launched her terri- </p><p>V	V ble and unwilling accusation against</p><p>her father and was carried unconscious </p><p>from the room, I realized that I was, to all </p><p>intents and purposes, a free man. Miss </p><p>Temple, it is true, had testified that the win- </p><p>dow was closed, but she could not know </p><p>whether it was bolted, or whether Ashton </p><p>had opened it later to secure fresh air during</p><p>the night. It seemed probable that he had, </p><p>but how to account for its subsequent re- </p><p>bolting from .the inside I could not imagine, </p><p>unless Major Temple had done it, unknown </p><p>to me, when we first entered the room. </p><p> I looked to see all these matters cleared up</p><p>when he was placed upon the stand, and I </p><p>was not surprised to see one of the officers </p><p>approach the figure sitting bowed and silent </p><p>among the buzzing spectators and, laying </p><p>his hand upon liis shoulder, bend down and </p><p>whisper a few low words into his ear. He </p><p>arose and was about to accompany the offi- </p><p>ce’- to the dock, when there was a murmur of </p><p>voices about the door and I saw Sergeant </p><p>McQuade enter with the «gly figure of Li </p><p>Min beside him, followed by the interpreter, </p><p>while Inspector Bums stepped quickly to </p><p>the Magistrate’s desk and said a few hur- </p><p>ried words to him in a low voice. </p><p> The Magistrate, apparently very much</p><p>surprised, turned to the court-room, rapped </p><p>loudly for order and motioned to the officer </p><p>in charge of Major Temple to release him. </p><p>Sergeant McQuade, meanwhile, with his </p><p>prisoner, had advanced to the dock, and </p><p>without further ceremony I saw the court </p><p>attendants administer the oath,, the import </p><p>of this being explained to the Chinaman by </p><p>the interpreter. </p><p>I LEARNED afterward that Li </p><p>Min, upon his first appearance as a </p><p>witness, had been under the im- </p><p>pression that he was being tried for his </p><p>attempt to steal my satchel, and as he did </p><p>not then know that his compatriots in Lon- </p><p>don had secured the emerald, feared to make </p><p>disclosures. Learning from the interpreter </p><p>during the noon-hour that the Emerald </p><p>Buddha had been secured by his friends in </p><p>London, he was at last persuaded to tell his </p><p>story. </p><p> It seems that Li Min, like many of his</p><p>countrymen, was under suspicion through </p><p>association with the reform movement, </p><p>and, knowing the enmity of the Dow- </p><p>ager Empress and her advisors toward this </p><p>movement, had come to Hong Kong with </p><p>the intention of leaving the country. His </p><p>engagement as a servant by Major Temple </p><p>enabled him to leave China without being </p><p>under any suspicions as to his motives for </p><p>doing so. It was during the voyage to Eng- </p><p>land, and his subsequent stay in Major </p><p>Temple’s service, that he first learned the </p><p>story of the Emerald Buddha, piece by </p><p>piece, and of Ashton’s determination ir&gt; </p><p>secure the sacred relic. His religious feelings-,</p><p>were outraged and he promptly sei&amp;jword </p><p>to the followers of Buddha in Ping Yang. </p><p>But when the word at last reached them, </p><p>Ashton had already escaped with the jewel. </p><p>The priest set out at once for London with </p><p>two of his followers, making such speed that </p><p>they arrived in London some weeks before </p><p>Ashton’s coming. </p><p> Li Min was to notify them as soon as</p><p>Ashton arrived and it would then be Li </p><p>Min’s part to admit his confederates to the </p><p>house and with their assistance steal the </p><p>jewel and make away with it. His trip to </p><p>Exeter had been for this purpose, but owing </p><p>to the furious storm the night of Ashta&gt;v!r </p><p>arrival, he decided to wait till morning. &gt;' </p><p>had overheard the quarrel, feared </p><p>ton might leave with the jewel, and p </p><p>an uneasy night. </p><p> He arose about four o’clock and</p><p>silently through the hallway to&gt; </p><p>Th Emerald Buddha	373</p><p>door, hoping to find it unfastened. Upc </p><p>finding it bolted, he had gone to the hall </p><p>window; raised the sash and looked out. </p><p>He made a quick decision to climb out </p><p>upon *he roof, enter Ashton’s room by </p><p>means of Ifie window and secure the emer- </p><p>ald. But fearing lest he might be recog- </p><p>nized by some chance early riser among </p><p>the stablemen or gardeners, he descended </p><p>swiftly to the main hall, threw on a long, </p><p>tan raincoat and tweed cap belonging to </p><p>Major itmple and, so disguised, returned </p><p>to the porch roof. </p><p> He was making his way quietly along to</p><p>the window of Ashton’s room when seen by </p><p>Miss Temple. He found Ashton’s window </p><p>bolted on the inside, but the increasing </p><p>light showed him dimly the interior of the </p><p>room, with Ashton asleep in the bed. He </p><p>had cut his hand badly upon a projecting </p><p>nail or bit of glass, and had rested his </p><p>bloody palm upon the sill, his fingers point- </p><p>ing inward. His efforts to open the window </p><p>awoke the sleeping man within. What fol- </p><p>lowed I will try to tell in Li Min’s own </p><p>words as rendered into English by the in- </p><p>terpreter: </p><p> “I saw the man rolling about in his bed.</p><p>He seemed to be suffering, and I heard him </p><p>groan and once cry out in his sleep. I </p><p>pushed the window again, and it made a </p><p>loud noise. The man jumped up quickly </p><p>and started toward the window. His face </p><p>was white and terrible. And as he jumped </p><p>from bed, the hand of Buddha, the Mighty, </p><p>the Wonderful One, who knows all things,</p><p>smote him like a flash of fire! He fell upon </p><p>the floor, uttering a loud cry. </p><p> “I was frightened, and ran along the</p><p>roof and climbed into the house through the </p><p>hall window. I heard sounds in the room </p><p>of the young man [Mr. Morgan]. I closed </p><p>the window but forgot to bolt it. I ran </p><p>quickly along the hall and went down the </p><p>stairs. I put the coat and cap in the closet </p><p>in the hall, where I had found them, and </p><p>went out through the servants’ entrance. </p><p>I walked into Exeter and sent word to my </p><p>brothers in London that the sacred relic </p><p>had come. Then I had some breakfast and </p><p>-'"me back. </p><p> Afterward I learned that the jewel was</p><p> I did not know whether the great</p><p> ia had taken it away or not. At last</p><p> ad man was taken away and I was</p><p> -» fix the room. I searched every-</p><p> I could not find the stone. At</p><p> .at the young man came into the room</p><p>suddenly. After a time he took the piece </p><p>of soap and went away. I was a fool—I </p><p>had not thought of the soap, which lay there </p><p>in front of my eyes. It was the only thing </p><p>I had not searched. I knew that if Buddha </p><p>had not taken away the stone, it must be </p><p>concealed there. </p><p> “I watched the young man. I saw him</p><p>put it in his bag. I went down-stairs, and </p><p>when the satchel was left unguarded for a </p><p>moment I took it. The young man and the </p><p>officer were outside and stopped me. When </p><p>I was taken into the jail at Exeter, my </p><p>friend, Chuen Moy, came to see me, I told </p><p>him through the bars what had happened. </p><p>I did not know whether the young man </p><p>would keep the stone or give it to the </p><p>officer. I told Chuen Moy to go to London </p><p>and inform our brothers that they might </p><p>get the stone. I have done nothing wrong. </p><p>The man who died had offended the great </p><p>Buddha. He committed a sacrilege and he </p><p>deserved to die. The mighty hand of the </p><p>All-Powerful One was stretched out and he </p><p>fell dead! I myself have seen the miracle. </p><p>It is the vengeance of Buddha! ” </p><p>I DO NOT know what the efiect </p><p>of this weird story was upon the </p><p>others in the court-room, but to me </p><p>it rang with all the accents of sincerity and </p><p>truth. Not that I believed in the vengeance </p><p>of Buddha, although even this I was not </p><p>prepared to deny, but his story explained </p><p>everything—and nothing. My heart gave </p><p>a great leap of joy, for I knew that this </p><p>terrible thing about Muriel’s father, which</p><p>she so firmly believed, must have almost </p><p>broken her heart. Yet for me, she had told </p><p>the terrible truth, as she believed it, and to </p><p>save me she had gone all the way to Lon- </p><p>don, to ask my advice. I began to hope </p><p>that she might have for me a feeling not dis- </p><p>similar to that which I so strongly felt for </p><p>her. </p><p> Major Temple was put upon the stand</p><p>again, but there was no evidence now to </p><p>connect either Miss Temple, her father or </p><p>myself with the murder. Li Min had </p><p>borne out my story regarding the taking </p><p>of the cake of soap in every particular. I </p><p>was discharged, along with Major Temple </p><p>and Miss Temple, and only Li Min re- </p><p>mained in custody, held upon the technical </p><p>charge of assaulting McQuade and threat- </p><p>ening him with a deadly weapon. In* </p><p>Adventure </p><p>374 </p><p>.spectoi*’ Burns and Sergeant McQuade bo... </p><p>signified their intention of going to London </p><p>at once—the latter, however, to come down </p><p>to The Oaks the following day for a final </p><p>examination into the mystery. He did not </p><p>believe for a moment that part of Li Min’s </p><p>story which referred to the sudden death of </p><p>Mr. Ashton, and still suspected the China- </p><p>man of the crime. </p><p> I was requested by Major Temple to</p><p>accompany him and his daughter back to </p><p>The Oaks, an invitation of which I was by </p><p>no means slow to avail myself. The poor </p><p>girl was greatly upset, and very much tired </p><p>out, and we made haste to get her home as </p><p>quickly as possible. </p><p> I was given the same room I had pre-</p><p>viously occupied and we sat down to dinner </p><p>with some show of cheerfulness, Miss Tem- </p><p>ple looking especially charming in a green </p><p>silk evening-gown which to my artist’s </p><p>eyes made her a picture I longed to put on </p><p>canvas. I told her so, and we were soon </p><p>discussing pictures, and art generally, at a </p><p>lively rate. Only the Major seemed de- </p><p>pressed, and I imagine this came from his </p><p>regret at the loss of the wonderful Emerald </p><p>Buddha. What had become of the jewel </p><p>I did not know, but I fancied that Mc- </p><p>Quade’s hurried trip to London had some- </p><p>thing to do with the search Ms men were </p><p>making for the lost underground temple of </p><p>Buddha. </p><p> After dinner Major Temple excused</p><p>himself upon the plea that he wanted to </p><p>write some letters, while Miss Temple and </p><p>I sat down before the fire in the library for</p><p>our first real tSte-a-tete. It had begun to </p><p>rain heavily outside, with a stiff breeze </p><p>blowing from the southwest, and it seemed </p><p>wonderfully fine and warm and altogether </p><p>delightful sitting here in the firelight with </p><p>the woman I loved beside me. </p><p>CHAPTER XVI </p><p>I ASK MISS TEMPLE A QUESTION </p><p>“ lV/riSS TEMPLE,” I said, as wesatbe- </p><p> -*-»A side each other on the big leather-</p><p>covered settee facing the fire, “I want to </p><p>thank you with all my heart for going up to </p><p>London to see me. I know why you went </p><p>and can never tell you how deeply I appre- </p><p>ciate it.” </p><p> She looked at me with her bewitching</p><p>smile, wMch somehow made me feel both </p><p>uelightfuily happy and yet vaguely- un- </p><p>certain of myself. “I had to come, Mr. </p><p>Morgan,” she said, her voice trembling with </p><p>the agony of her former suspicions of her </p><p>father. “As soon as I knew’the police were </p><p>fastening their suspicions upon you, I knew </p><p>I should be obliged to tell what I had seen. </p><p>Had I found you in London, I should have </p><p>told you everything and been guided by </p><p>your advice.” </p><p> “I wish you had found me there,” I said,</p><p>“but as it is, everything has turned out well. </p><p>Only I am sorry that you should have had </p><p>tc undergo such a terrible experience.” </p><p> “Oh, it wasn’t so bad. They gave me a</p><p>very comfortable room at the police station </p><p>in London, and the matron was extremely </p><p>kind. I might almost have enjoyed the </p><p>experience had I not been suffering so about </p><p>my father. ” Her look of pain at the recollec- </p><p>tion made me change the subject and talk </p><p>of London and my friends among artists </p><p>and musicians. </p><p> “It’s the life I’ve always dreamed of,”</p><p>she said, her cheeks flushing with excite- </p><p>ment. “I’ve been to so many places, Rome </p><p>and Paris, and Vienna and Cairo, and the </p><p>East you know', but I really know very little </p><p>about them. The outside I have seen, of </p><p>course, but the real life—that I have missed. </p><p>And now wre are stuck down here, where we </p><p>don’t know anybody, because father fancies </p><p>it is good for Ms health. I suppose it is, but </p><p>it isn’t real, joyous living. I hardly feel </p><p>alive.” </p><p> “But you go to London, don’t you?.</p><p>Your father spoke of Ms house then’. </p><p> “Oh, yes, but father’s friends are mostly</p><p>professors of Assyriology, and Egyptology </p><p>and people of that sort, and they come and </p><p>stay for hours and talk about scarabs and</p><p>liieroglypMcs and mummies and all that sort </p><p>of thing. Sometimes I feel almost as though </p><p>I were about to become a mummy myself! ” </p><p> She certainly did not look it, with her</p><p>wonderful color, and her large and brilliant </p><p>eyes. I could not help looking,.deep into </p><p>them as I replied, only half smiling: </p><p> “ We must prevent that, at all costs. Let</p><p>me help in preventing it.”. She laughed </p><p>nervously, but did .not seem displeased </p><p>my remark. “I think the experiences of </p><p>past week have caused us to know each o </p><p>very well,” I went on, gravely, “and I </p><p>you may tMnk as much of the friei </p><p>wMch has come to us as I do.” </p><p> “Are we, then, really friends?</p><p>•'ddha </p><p>375 </p><p>slowly. ^“1 never had a man ...fid—no* </p><p>very many of any sort, I fear. We have al- </p><p>ways moved about so much from place to </p><p>place.” </p><p> “Perhaps not friends,” I said, and as I</p><p>did so I placed my hand over hers, which lay </p><p>beside me upon the leather seat of the settle. </p><p>“At least not friends only. I have always </p><p>dreamed, all my life, of a woman like you, </p><p>who would be dose beside me, and share all </p><p>my hopes and dreams, and be the cause of </p><p>them all as well, and be glad of my suc- </p><p>cesses and not think the less of me because </p><p>of my failures. But a woman to be all that </p><p>must be more than a man’s friend, Miss </p><p>Temple—she must be his wife.” </p><p> The color flooded her cheeks as I said</p><p>this, but she did not draw away her hand. </p><p>“A woman would have to be very greatly </p><p>loved by a man, and love him very greatly </p><p>in return, to be all that to him,” she said. </p><p> “ I can only speak for myself,” I said. “ I</p><p>love you very greatly—so much, indeed, that </p><p>I am telling you of it now—when I have the </p><p>opportunity—instead of waiting, as no </p><p>doubt you think I should. But we have </p><p>passed through much trouble, you and I, </p><p>and that has brought us close to each other. </p><p>I want you, I need you, I love you, and I </p><p>shall always love you!” I drew her to me, </p><p>and when she put her head upon my breast </p><p>I knew that I had found my heart’s desire. </p><p>IT MUST have been half -an hour </p><p>later when Major Temple burst into </p><p>the library in a great state of excite- </p><p>ment and asked if we had seen anything of </p><p>Boris, his favorite mastiff. He had suddenly </p><p>realized, a few moments ago, that he had not </p><p>seen him since his return from Exeter. He </p><p>made inquiries, but none of the servants had</p><p>seen the dog since the day before. I remem- </p><p>bered at once the howling I had heard during </p><p>the night andspoke of it. The Major thought </p><p>for a moment, then raised his head with a </p><p>suuden look of comprehension. “Don’t you </p><p>remember, J$r. Morgan, that Boris was with </p><p>us "when We made our'examination of the </p><p>green room last night? I do not recollect </p><p>seeing him after that. The poor fellow has </p><p>'■ w.bt been locked in there ever since, and </p><p>his howls that you heard!” </p><p>followed him to the green room and </p><p>Temple tried several keys before </p><p>•&gt;ne that could open it. At last the </p><p>ed, however, and he attempted to </p><p>the door. It refused to open, </p><p> leit, he said, as though some heavy</p><p>object had been placed, against it. By push- </p><p>ing with our united strength we forced the </p><p>door inward sufficiently to allow us to enter. </p><p>The Major took a candle from my room and </p><p>we squeezed our way into the place with </p><p>some difficulty, Muriel remaining outside. </p><p>What was our astonishment to see lying </p><p>upon the floor, his head close to the door, as </p><p>though struck down in an effort to escape, </p><p>the Major’s mastiff, Boris, stone-dead, his </p><p>eyes wide open and staring, his mouth dis- </p><p>tended and still covered with foam, his face </p><p>wearing an expression of intense fear! </p><p> It was a horrible sight, and we looked at</p><p>each other in alarm. </p><p> “ My-!” said the Major. “This room</p><p>is accursed! Let us go!” </p><p>CHAPTER XVII </p><p>I SLEEP IN THE GREEN ROOM </p><p>“TX7HAT is the matter?” asked his </p><p>VV daughter as she saw our startled </p><p>faces. “Isn’t Boris there?” </p><p> The Major’s tone was grave and solemn.</p><p>“ He is there, Muriel, and he is dead. I do </p><p>not know what is the secret of that room, </p><p>but I shall never enter it again! ” He turned </p><p>from us and led the way down the hall. </p><p>When we reached the floor below, the </p><p>Major directed Gibson and one of the other </p><p>servants to remove the dog’s body from the </p><p>room, and we retired to the library, where </p><p>we discussed the matter for a long time. </p><p>But in spite of our attempts to regard the </p><p>event in a common-sense light, we could not </p><p>shake off a mysterious feeling of dread at </p><p>the thought of these two creatures, a man </p><p>and a dog, having so inexplicably come to </p><p>their ends in this room. In Ashton’s case </p><p>there was tangible evidence of the cause of </p><p>death, but on the dog’s body there was no </p><p>wound or mark of any sort.</p><p> Miss Temple essayed a few airs upon the</p><p>piano, but our thoughts were not attuned </p><p>to music, and presently, as it was close to </p><p>eleven o’clock, she said good-night to us </p><p>both and left us. I seized the opportunity </p><p>to tell the Major of my love for his daughter, </p><p>and, after his first gasp of surprise, he heard </p><p>me out with remarkable calmness, though </p><p>there was a frown upon his forehead. </p><p> At the mention of my profession and my</p><p>income I noticed that Major Temple’s frown </p><p>relaxed somewhat, but when I mentioned </p><p>my father’s name and the fact of his ha </p><p>spent a part of his life in India, he fairly </p><p>beamed. </p><p> '‘Are you really the son of Edward Mor-</p><p>gan?” he .fried, rising. “Why, my boy, I </p><p>knew him well! I was in the Indian service </p><p>for fifteen years, and who did not know him, </p><p>who has spent much time in that benighted </p><p>country? He was a fine man, and, if I </p><p>remember rightly, he refused a knighthood </p><p>for his services.” He came up to me and </p><p>took my hand. </p><p> “It’s all very sudden, I must say, but I</p><p>should be very glad to see Muriel happily </p><p>married, and if she believes.you to be the </p><p>right man, I shall interpose no objections. </p><p>Hut I should advise you both wait a reason- </p><p>able time, until you are certain that you </p><p>have not made any mistake. As for me, I </p><p>am an old man, and I have traveled all over </p><p>the world, but the only real happiness I have </p><p>ever found was in the love of my wife. She </p><p>went out to India with me, and she never </p><p>came back.” He turned and gazed into the </p><p>fire to hide his emotions. </p><p> “I have become half mad over this busi-</p><p>ness of collecting antiquities and curios,” he </p><p>resumed presently, “but it isn’t real—it’s </p><p>only an insane hobby after all, and I have </p><p>only just realized how selfish it all is.” </p><p>AS I STOPPED at my doorway, I </p><p>noticed that the door of the green </p><p>room stood partly open, and, filled </p><p>with a curious 'fascination, I once more </p><p>peered into its dark and silent interior. 1 </p><p>ceuld see only the faint outlines of the tall, </p><p>old-fashioned bed against the dim light of </p><p>the sky without the windows. I stepped </p><p>inside, acting upon the impulse of the mo- </p><p>ment,and lit one of the gas-jets in the heavy, </p><p>old-fashioned bronze chandelier. </p><p> The room seemed comfortable enough,</p><p>though I felt that peculiar stifling sensation </p><p>I had noticed upon my first entering it. I </p><p>wondered for the thousandth time what </p><p>strange secret lay concealed within its walls</p><p>—what mysterious influence existed which </p><p>was potent to strike down man or beast </p><p>alike without warning, as though by the </p><p>hand of death itself. I longed to penetrate </p><p>to the heart of this mystery—to satisfy my- </p><p>self that what had occurred herein had not </p><p>been supernatural, but merely some working </p><p>of well known natural laws. </p><p> Suddenly I was seized with an idea. Why</p><p>should I not spend the night here and possi- </p><p> tuus . .ermine the,_grin],. secret? The</p><p>idea grew upon me s6*srtrongly that I at once </p><p>returned to my own room, un3reai£d, ptit </p><p>on my pajamas and, taking a small pocket </p><p>revolver, crossed the hall &amp;to the room </p><p>opposite, carrying with me some extra </p><p>coverings for my bed. </p><p> I did not feel at all sleepy, so, after closing</p><p>the door and climbing into the high poster </p><p>bed, I lay back comfortably upon the pillows </p><p>and proceeded to occupy myself in read- </p><p>ing a magazine. </p><p>CHAPTER XVIH </p><p>A NIGHT OF HORROR </p><p>HpHE night was in many ways like the </p><p>-*■ one Robert Ashton spent there. A </p><p>heavy rain had set in, and the wind from </p><p>the southwest was driving it against the </p><p>windows of the room, just as it had done </p><p>that other night. I had attempted to raise </p><p>one of the windows before turning infibut </p><p>it was impossible to keep it open for any </p><p>length of time as the rain drove in fiercely </p><p>and threatened to flood the room. I began </p><p>to reconstruct in my mind the scene that </p><p>had been enacted in this room but a few </p><p>nights before—the stormy interview \jdth </p><p>Muriel, the hiding of the jewel in the soap </p><p>and the use of her forgotten handkerchief </p><p>for catching the flakes dug out by his pen- </p><p>knife. </p><p> Then, I thought, what next? No doubt</p><p>Ashton had turned off the gas and climbed </p><p>into bed. I say climbed advisedly, for- the </p><p>bed, one of those old-fashioned four-posters </p><p>with a feather mattress under the hair one, </p><p>was far higher from the floor than are our </p><p>modern beds, and to facilitate getting into </p><p>it there stood beside it a little low, wooden </p><p>stool, by which one ascended to its snowy </p><p>heights. </p><p> Presently, over my imaginings, 1 felt my-</p><p>self growing unaccountably sleepy and </p><p>tired. I realized that the strain of the long </p><p>day had been a heavy one, and could see </p><p>no reason for going, without a good night’s </p><p>rest. There was no .priceless jewel con- </p><p>cealed upon the premises to bring d*1^"</p><p>upon me either the vengeance of Bu- </p><p>or the murderous attacks of my fellow </p><p>I laughed a little at my earlier fear </p><p>rose in bed, reached over to the cha </p><p>and turned out the light. </p><p> I must have slept for several he</p><p>Missing Page: Page 377 </p><p>If you own this magazine, and would </p><p>like to contribute, please email us the </p><p>image (in .JPEG format at 300 dpi) to: </p><p>info@pulpmags. org </p><p>Missing Page: Page 378 </p><p>If you own this magazine, and would </p><p>like to contribute, please email us the </p><p>image (in .JPEG format at 300 dpi) to: </p><p>info@pulpmags. org </p><p>Missing Page: Inside Back Cover </p><p>If you own this magazine, and would </p><p>like to contribute, please email us the </p><p>image (in .JPEG format at 300 dpi) to: </p><p>info@pulpmags. org </p><p>Missing Page: Back Cover </p><p>If you own this magazine, and would </p><p>like to contribute, please email us the </p><p>image (in .JPEG format at 300 dpi) to: </p><p>info@pulpmags. org</p></body></text></TEI>
