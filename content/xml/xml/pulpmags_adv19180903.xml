His snores</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gurgles were not audible to the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the doorway of the blacksmith shop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they knew what he was doing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger was not sleeping. Chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilted back against the wall, spurred heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooked on a rung, he stared straight in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of him with a pair of humorous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed-out gray eyes. Apparently his</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny was directed upon Dave Smith's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony, tied to the well-chewed post in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Smith residence. After a time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger swept the figures of the blacksmith</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mr. Taylor with a calm, impersonal</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance and then looked out across the hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat to where the trail from Marysville and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south dropped down the slope of Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ridge. A cloud of dust was on the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The northbound stage was coming in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger's eyes switched back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pony tied to the post. He fished with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean brown fingers in a pocket of his vest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced the makings and rolled a cigaret,</seg><seg type="columnLine">employing for that purpose both hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had blown out his first deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhale, the white teeth beneath the stubby</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown mustache showed in a slow half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, a smile that faded as slowly as it came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the stranger was missing nothing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Messrs. Jackson's and Taylor's studiedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">unobtrusive stares. And they amused him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those stares. He had played draw with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blacksmith and two of the latter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends in the Happy Heart the evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, and he had taken their money away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them. This also had amused him. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneficent Providence having blessed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a spacious talent for poker and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">by-products, he was frequently enabled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">derive from life much innocent pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more coin of the realm, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A trickle of passers-by crossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger's field of vision: Mike Flynn, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-legged owner of the Blue Pigeon Store,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a seafaring roll in his walk that even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brass-bound mahogany pegleg could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">eradicate; plump Mrs. Rule, the sheriff's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife, intent on dotted calico and baking-</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder; the amiable owner of the Canton</seg><seg type="columnLine">Restaurant, tall Sing Luey, resplendent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">black silk trousers and embroidered over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt, meditatively sucking the mouth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of his yard-long silver-mounted pipe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intent on heaven knew what dream of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">High Pockets</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">own home-town; and pale-faced Mr. Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stute, frock-coated, wearing a shirt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many pleats and his perennial smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clean-shaven, handsome, debonair to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree, Mr. Stute, proprietor and manager</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Dewdrop Dance-Hall, was a picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fill any one's eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger surveyed the march past</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mr. Stute from beneath half-closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyelids. He was not sure that he liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Stute. Shooting at random, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, he believed he preferred that in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutable Celestial, Sing Luey, to Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stute. There was that about the dance-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall person, a subtle cocksureness among</seg><seg type="columnLine">other little traits, that grated. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger had not the pleasure of Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stute's acquaintance, nor did he greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">care for Chinamen, but he had a vast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">childlike faith in his own instinct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A thudding patter drummed across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat waves of the flat. The stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked southward along the trail. A quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter-mile away, dimly visible through rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds of dust, the legs of the stage horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">were twinkling in a frantic gallop. Came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pistol-like crack of a whip--once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice, and again. "Whisky Jim" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouraging his teams. Whisky Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">whooped a series of shrill whoops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must be haulin' a woman," the stranger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise as to the practise of stage-drivers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">concluded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Creaking and swaying, curtains flapping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stage whirled past. With a hearty</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout, Whisky Jim straightened a leg on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brake lever and swayed back on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunched reins. The stage ground to a halt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of the stage station. Whisky Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">set the brake and climbed down. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger watched lazily. Whisky Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the stage door, stretched in a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and dragged out a large valise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ladies first!" bawled Whisky Jim, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trousered leg appeared, the foot feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the step.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leg and foot jerked backward, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, and then slowly, hesitatingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slim figure of a girl in dusty dark blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out and down. She was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, this girl. The stranger decided as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked at her standing there beside her</seg><seg type="columnLine">great valise, that she possessed the smallest</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet he had ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The owner of the trousered leg that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">annoyed Whisky Jim scuttled out with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautious eye to the stage driver and van-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ished within the Happy Heart Saloon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whisky Jim turned to help the Wells Fargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard with the express box and the mail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bags. The girl stood beside her valise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed upon the false fronts of Farewell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't she belong to nobody?" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger asked himself, and removed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels from the chair rung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mr. Stute hurried out into the street and</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached the girl. Mr. Stute achieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low bow and a hat flourish. It must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that Mr. Stute had title to certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">airs and graces. Mr. Stute, his head bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">deferentially, spoke at some length to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. The stranger could not hear what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was saying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Dance-hall floozie," he said to himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rehooked his heels. "Must belong to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He set himself to the rolling of a fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigaret. He had lost all interest in the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But the interest returned full force when,</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently, came toward him along the side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk Mr. Stute and the girl. Now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger had a fair view of her face. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a beautiful face, but it was a sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and the expression made it very lovely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was strength in the wide mouth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm chin. There was sadness in the wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set dark eyes as she glanced at the stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">in passing. Promptly he revised his pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious estimate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She never was in a dance-hall in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">life," he told himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Stute awakened Bill Lainey and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the hotel proprietor that the lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired a room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not an expensive room," put in the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I--I can't pay very much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rooms all the same price," said Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lainey, heaving himself erect.

"Yuh can have the young-un's</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Four-bits a day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Four-bits?" repeated the girl uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehendingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Fifty cents," explained Bill Lainey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't understand if beds are one dollar</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day, how-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all right," Mr. Stute assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, clapping Bill on the shoulder.

The few diners, stray punch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers and the stage station employees, ate</seg><seg type="columnLine">with diffidence. They were not accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed to women of the girl's species.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger surreptitiously watched her</seg><seg type="columnLine">while she ate. He was glad that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed her hat. He enjoyed looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hair. It was so darkly brown and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth and shiny. The girl's appetite</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have been better. She merely pecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sowbelly and beans, but she ate all</seg><seg type="columnLine">her canned tomatoes and drank two cups</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the terrifically strong coffee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The meal over, the girl disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stranger, in his chair on the sidewalk</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear her moving about her room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a time all sound of movement ceased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later the stranger thought he heard stifled</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing. But he could not be sure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Came then through the dusk Mr. Stute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking rapidly. He entered the hotel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Lainey was indoors cleaning his rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's the little lady?" inquired Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In her room," replied Bill, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompaniment of a squirted oil can's</seg><seg type="columnLine">double click.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ask her if she'll see me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Lainey feet shuffled across the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Lainey knuckles rapped on a door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gent to see yuh, ma'am," said Bill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's the gent brung yuh here--Mister</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Stute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger leaned across his chair arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nearer the doorway.

The fiddler on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his table was sawing out the merry strains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of "Zip Coon" in perfunctory fashion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Windy Taylor was endeavoring to waltz</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a painted blonde and making a boggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford of it. It was evident that the Double</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diamond A puncher had had several. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blonde was making fun of him. As they</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid past the doorway she expertly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged herself and propelled Windy to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar. They drank, and the blonde added</seg><seg type="columnLine">another check to her string.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were five women in the Dewdrop</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dance-Hall, good-looking and light-footed</seg><seg type="columnLine">females all of them, well-assorted too--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of blondes, two brunettes, and a red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired girl. For Mr. Stute knew the value</seg><seg type="columnLine">of display advertising.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger draped himself against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar and poured out a modest two fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Buy me a drink, dearie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the red-haired girl, a full-bosomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cyprian with excellent teeth.

She laid a plump hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yuh dunno what yo're sayin'," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger sipped his whisky and stared into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long mirror behind the bar. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the reflection of Mr. Stute in the mirror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Stute was talking to one "Longhorn"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simms, a swarthy citizen with a broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Simms was a person of some local</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputation. He ran the games in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Happy Heart Saloon. He had killed two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the way of his profession and wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">derringers in his vest-pockets. The name</seg><seg type="columnLine">Longhorn fitted. He was excessively hard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he was smiling--as the wolf smiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it licks its jaws. Mr. Stute was</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckling. He was apparently telling Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simms a story both pithy and pointed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Zip Coon" drowned his words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger moved across the room to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">window adjacent to the gambler and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story-teller. He put his hand on the sill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked out into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tomorrow I'll turn the trick," Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stute was saying. "I don't know but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll keep her myself--for a while.

Do you see it? Not a friend in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Territory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An' you'll be her friend." The wolfish</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile on the mouth of Mr. Simms turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarcastic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I sure will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Betcha fifty yuh get the mitten."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Make it a hundred, and give me two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shore.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger sat down on the window sill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten minutes later he left the dance-hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went to the Happy Heart to play stud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger rose late the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. He was alone in the eight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedded room. The other guests, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">punchers and a stray-man, were at break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. When he had pulled on his boots, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled his hair with a sweep of his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took his six-shooter from its holster</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew out the cylinder. He inspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the five cartridges, replaced the cylinder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carefully settled the hammer on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty chamber. He shoved the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">into its holster, buckled on the belt, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied down the holster. As every one</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows, tying down a holster makes for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure draw. Gun-fighters employ this pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cedure extensively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Which being done the stranger went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his war-bags where they lay on the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened them and pulled from beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">his extra shirt the mate to the six-shooter</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his right leg. This firearm he treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">precisely as he had the other, save that</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it was in readiness for action he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoved it down inside the waistband of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trousers, so that it cuddled his body slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of the right hip-bone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the other half of his war-bags he</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced a heavy-bladed, thin-handled</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowie. This knife he inserted in a leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheath cunningly sewn into the back of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vest high up at the neck on the right-hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Then he put on the vest, wriggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders till the bowie lay snugly where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it should, and went down to breakfast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl was the sole occupant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining-room. When he pulled out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, she returned his greeting timidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eye on her plate.

But it was a grudge fight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both brutes were red-eyed with rage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They minded him not at all at first, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only his natural agility saved him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">being brained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He beat them apart at last, whacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">them soundly over their rumps and drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to their respective corners.

The dance-hall's win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows and doors were all open, front and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear. Tall Sing Luey, standing in his door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, had a fairly comprehensive view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior of that dance-hall. Sing Luey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sucking his long pipe, which no one had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen him smoke, stood motionless, his legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">widespread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he stepped down on the side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk and shuffled across the street in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of Lainey's Hotel.

"Mr. Stute has her in the dance-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Them nuts shore can wait," observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stranger, and departed in haste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger walked quickly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance-hall doorway. The girl and Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stute were the sole occupants of the large</seg><seg type="columnLine">front room. Even the bartender was</seg><seg type="columnLine">absent from his post. Mr. Stute seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">annoyed at the stranger's entry. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced sharply at the intruder. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if by an afterthought, smiled slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nodded to him. The stranger went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bar.

I regret to say, madam, that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer is no longer open." Mr. Stute turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the girl and added, looking sidewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the stranger, "The audience will please</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass out quietly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will," indorsed the stranger.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bartender was indorsing every word with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the utmost heartiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guess they's only the two of 'em,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazarded Henderson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt of his weapons, dodged 'round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the dance-hall and entered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">High Pockets</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">n</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■way of the front door. Mr. Stute and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bartender were alone in the room. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no movement. For Henderson had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerked the gun on his leg, and a remarkably</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold and washed-out gray eye was glinting</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them along the sights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You said somethin' about the audience</seg><seg type="columnLine">passin' out quietly a while ago," observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Henderson.

Mr. Stute, hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">held level with his shoulders, followed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if hypnotized.

Henderson slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the six-shooter into its holster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHICH was enough to satisfy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most exacting of persons. It satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied Mr. Stute. His hand streaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the gun-butt under his coat. Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson's left hand moved slightly. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">vest flew open. There was a spitting flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a bang, and Mr. Stute, his undis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged weapon shot out of his fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered sidewise to the warehouse wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding a numbed forearm. Mr. Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson gazed upon Mr. Stute with interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The hand is quicker than the eye,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Mr. Henderson succinctly. "An' that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">somethin' else yuh've learned today."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stepped close in to Mr. Stute and stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">into that temporarily subdued person's</seg><seg type="columnLine">close-set eyes.

Customers, most of them, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him with friendly eyes. A few, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">boon-companions of Mr. Stute, eyed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">askance. He, a stranger, had shattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">their idol. None, however, offered to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the dance-hall person's quarrel. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered what Henderson was thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. He' seemed so completely en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grossed in his thoughts. Sat and stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his liquor without drinking it.

From the idea he evolved a plan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an amazingly simple plan. He arose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving his untouched drink on the table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went to the Canton for dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The few guests had finished and gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he entered.

A dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the other end of Main Street took excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the moon and began to bark. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">coyote in the distance yapped steadily.

Sing Luey set the lamp on a table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the key in the door-lock, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped a heavy piece of tapestry across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henderson's eyes ranged the room.

The gorgeous China silk hangings</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealing the walls and windows, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient leather-bound books that heaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-half the table, filled him with wonder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had never seen such things before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Sing Luey had once cooked for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gross T!

He was warmly aware that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been made game of. But he did not feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite up to the task of resenting it--not</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Henderson. The latter was too utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">careless of consequences. It was a pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. Why seek to leave it? Thus, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncultured way, reasoned the marshal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went home to breakfast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the blacksmith shop Henderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the Starlight Saloon. The red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed bartender was yawningly mopping up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in preparation for the daily tide of</seg><seg type="columnLine">customers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Curryin' the floor thisaway is one-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fool trick," said the bartender without</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising his eyes, at Henderson's entrance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But the boss says she's gotta be did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">-, they aint no sense in bein' so per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nickety. She only gets dirty again. I--</seg><seg type="columnLine">oh, it's you, is it? He didn't get yuh, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he?" he added in a tone of disappointment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be so-sorry," adjured Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson. "Where'd them bullets go?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Through the window."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know that.

They were some ten feet apart and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bored at an angle. He produced a clasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife and dug into the wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, don't do that!" remonstrated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bartender. "Yo're spoilin' the planks."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Which yo're the most contrary gent I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever see," pronounced Henderson, not ceas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to labor. "Yo're always wantin' a fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler to stop what he's doin'. She's a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit. Yuh'd oughta get over it. I gotta</seg><seg type="columnLine">have these bullets. I gotta. They's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">two ways about it.

Why, feller, s'pose them</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets had landed in you. I'd have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">diggin' 'em out o' yore carcass. Think o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, an' shut up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henderson's tone toward the end of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech, became sinister. The bartender</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieted and went sulkily on with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henderson scooped out the bullets with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out difficulty and examined them closely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dropped them into a pocket of his vest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rang down a silver dollar on the bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They's a wheel for the damage," he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bartender, and marched out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Returning to the hotel he went in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast. Of the few guests all were pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent save Miss Blythe. Henderson, despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a late start was the first to finish. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the dining-room he heard Miss Blythe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">door open. But he did not turn his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Henderson, anxious to disseminate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little misleading information, sauntered</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the Happy Heart. A modest one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingered drink in the heel of his hand, he ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed the bartender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dunno where I can pick up a few horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' maybe some mules, do yuh?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson, conscious that Longhorn Simms</seg><seg type="columnLine">was standing in the doorway of the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">room where he ran his games.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I don't," replied the bartender.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Some o' the outfits 'round here might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few hosses to sell.

He al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready knew that their caliber was .45-90, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">caliber common to many rifles in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Territory.

There, on the far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther side, like a jack-rabbit in its form, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man lay on his stomach. By the turn of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head he seemed to be watching the gate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corral and the log on which Henderson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle trailed its stirrups.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ain't there no more," Henderson ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served in a conventional tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man humped himself at the hips and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled to his frightened feet.

The Dewdrop's deni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zens and the customers lined wall and bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cheered the puncher on.

The washed-out gray gaze held</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady. The spirit behind the black eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled all it knew, but it did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough.

A blue flash arced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lamplight, steel struck bone with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracking snap, and Mr. Stute thumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on his knees at Henderson's feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Stute's features were convulsed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain, he grunted like a pig.

The fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones are too fresh, and the nice ones are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">too-nice. It's a dog's life, being a girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What do you want anyway?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help.

All right, tell sister."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told--at great length.

Henderson's movements, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last several miles, had been furtive. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode the draws and regarded the landscape</seg><seg type="columnLine">warily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A scant half-mile from the Springs he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismounted between two short, steep-sided</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillocks spattered with a careless growth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jack-pine. He anchored his horse to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pine, took from his off saddlebag a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-kept field-glasses and climbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher of the two hillocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last few yards of the ascent he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his hands and knees. Arriving at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top he removed his hat, lay down full-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">length beneath a jack-pine, and focused</seg><seg type="columnLine">his glasses on the Blythe house and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">environs thereof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A haze of yellow dust was over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blythe corral. A thin gray smoke as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cended from the middle of the corral.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Across the windless air came faintly to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears the bawling of an indignant cow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson's mouth, beneath the stubby</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustache, straightened to a white line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Somebody ain't losin' a bit o' time,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he observed with wrath. "An' I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">I better not lose any either."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned hurriedly to his horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosed the reins, and mounted without</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching the stirrup. The yellow horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what signified that flying mount.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He laid back his ears, tucked in his tail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and snapped at the bit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Slide, feller, slide," rapped out Hender-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, srnking his spurs. "Split the breeze."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He whirled his quirt cross-handed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut the yellow horse again and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the rear cinch. The yellow flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened out and flew. He had rolled many</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles behind him since leaving Farewell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was tired, but he was not yet done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He responded to spurs and quirt with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every ounce of strength in his tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking advantage of natural cover in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shape of two dry washes and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitable cottonwoods on the creek bank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson ran his horse to within four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards of the house. Profanely</seg><seg type="columnLine">praising the blessed fact that the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay between him and the corral, he checked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mount, dismounted and knotted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reins 'round a tree's slim bole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dragged a Winchester from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scabbard under the right fender and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward on foot. No Indian could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved more quietly than did Henderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he slipped through the cottonwoods</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward that place where smoke mingled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with dusty haze and cattle bawled their</seg><seg type="columnLine">protests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim Blythe had cleared away the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the creek bank in front of the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for a space of twenty yards on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. Where the cover ended Henderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused and crouched behind a red willow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between the willow branches Henderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see a goodly part of the corral stock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ade where it projected beyond the house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the smoke of the fire was plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible above the stockade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">42</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henderson waited until a sharp, sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">bawl proclaimed the laying on of a hot iron.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, while the attention of the men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corral was concentrated on the work in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, he slipped like a shadow across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open ground and gained the shelter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dropped on his knees, crawled rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">'round the house on all fours, and hugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall at one corner. With all care he</seg><seg type="columnLine">poked forth his hatless head and recon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noitered. One of Henderson's winning</seg><seg type="columnLine">traits was the faculty of swift and all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">embracing observation. Under the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstances a bare glance was sufficient.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He withdrew his head and squatted back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had seen that the gate of the corral</seg><seg type="columnLine">was distant not thirty 'yards, that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at least a score of cows within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure, and that upon one hog-tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of the band two men were operating</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a heavy iron and a wet blanket. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men were the Marysville marshal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Eliphalet Scattergood, the latter well</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unfavorably known among his kind as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lafe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder if they's any more," pondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson. "I couldn't see only two</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The question was important. Henderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked his crabwise way to the rear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and looked in through a window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no one in that room, the kitchen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a three-room house. Within sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds Henderson was satisfied that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">domicile was untenanted. He returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner from which he had spied upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dusty gentlemen in the corral, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned his rifle against the log wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a li'l dirty work now," he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly, "an' everythin'll be hunkydory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took off the black and red polka-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dotted handkerchief that encircled his neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flattened it against a log. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">employing for the purpose his pocket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife, he jagged out three holes. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these holes were on a line, the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">some inches below and between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The holes completed, Henderson put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief over his face and head in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a manner that he was enabled to see through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper holes and breathe through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower. Holding the handkerchief in place</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson settled his hat hard down on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. Experimentally he shook his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The handkerchief flapped at the bottom,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but the hat held the upper part firmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson next removed his vest, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">it inside out and put it on. After which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pulled off his boots and set them upright</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside his rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope they ain't too many stones," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered anxiously as he drew his two six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only three more," observed the marshal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his friend Mr. Scattergood, and tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steaming blanket into a pail of water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"An' that's one - good thing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">declared Mr. Scattergood, his fingers busily</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed in releasing the feet of a cow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This ain't no job for two men. Which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I never worked so hard in my life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep on an' you'll shore work harder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feller," remarked a genial voice from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corral gate. "I got a picture o' you</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakin' stone--that is, if y'ain't lynched</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The backs of both men were toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate. Neither man budged out of position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor did he move so much as a finger. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">marshal, in the act of scratching a match</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his trousers when the voice broke upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears, balanced himself on one leg like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crane. The kneeling, back-bent Mr. Scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tergood stared dumbly at the cow's hoof</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his paralyzed hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right," commended the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerily, "hold it an' watch for the pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird. A couple o' clicks an' yore picture's</seg><seg type="columnLine">took."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The unseen laughed with relish. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">marshal swayed slightly.

The latter, facing the gate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a tall citizen, his face masked by a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">and black polka-dotted handkerchief, lean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lazily over the bars. The masked</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual wore a peculiar-looking vest</seg><seg type="columnLine">without buttons, and his two six-shooters</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore directly upon Mr. Scattergood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friend, the marshal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The gent lookin' at me will now un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckle his belt an' let 'er drop," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown.

When his belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and six-shooter were on the ground Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scattergood was ordered to wheel about</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put his hands up. With Mr. Scatter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">good faced to the rear in the posture of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">signaler sending the letter U, the tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizen began on the marshal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turn loose yore belt an' drop her, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">other feller," were his words. "Then you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can turn 'round, too, first puttin' up yore</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The marshal obeyed quite as meticu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lously as had Mr. Scattergood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You ain't wearin' no star on that vest,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">complained the tall citizen.

The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tangled pair flopped over with a jerk. Mr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Scattergood was now underneath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The marshal drove his knee into the solar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plexus of Mr. Scattergood. The latter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">went limp with a wheeze. Kneeling upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the senseless form of Mr. Scattergood, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">victorious marshal, out of his one service-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able eye, looked about him for a rock with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which to further dent the features of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">comrade. An ancient friendship had in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deed been shattered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At this (juncture long ■fingers inserted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">themselves between the collar of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">marshal and his neck. He was yanked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">backward and flung down in a huddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He sat up, acutely conscious that he ached</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in all parts of him, and waggled an abraded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chin. The masked citizen, sitting back on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his heels a few yards away, surveyed the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed and battered countenance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marshal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ain't got no kick cornin' a-tall," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unknown. "I dunno when I've seen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a better fight. You fellers done well,-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">well. I didn't think yuh had it in yuh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest I didn't. Yuh needn't go to get up</seg><seg type="columnLine">after yore hat now. Just sit still till yore</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend pulls 'round. He'll be all right in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake. He's breathin' better already."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BARGAIN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE tall citizen shepherded the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggering men to their horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've took the rifles off o' yore saddles</seg><seg type="columnLine">so's yuh won't be tempted," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now," he went on, when they had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">their very clumsy mounts, "start off slow--</seg><seg type="columnLine">no, this way. I wanna be able to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">yuh while I'm pullin' on my boots. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">yuh get across Calf Creek, head east for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them hills. She's five miles across that flat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An' I'd go straight across if I was you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've got a cayuse cached 'round here, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might come after yuh an' show yuh the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way if yuh forget an' drift north or south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">After yuh get to the hills I don't give a-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whatcha do. I'm goin' some'ers else myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty prompt. I hear this country ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">healthy for road-agents--or brand-blot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two thoroughly chastened men made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no remark. They rode down to the creek,</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashed across, and headed toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant hills. The tall citizen, pulling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boots, watched them go. Not till they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were three hundred yards away did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remove his handkerchief mask. He knotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">it 'round his neck, turned his vest, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">built himself a cigaret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm bettin' them two jiggers will be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marysville tomorrow," Henderson said</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud. "Yessir, I'm shore gamblin' on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. An' they won't be expectin' to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">no road-agent neither."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went into the corral, took from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pail the soaked blanket and wrung it out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He retrieved the marshal's star and put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an inside vest-pocket. He up-ended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pail over the fire and gathered up the belts</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their dangling six-shooters and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy running-iron used by the men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their brand-blotting, and dumped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">articles into the blanket. He folded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">High Pockets</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket over and over till he had a compact</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dropped the bundle beside his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winchester and picked up the rifles he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken from the two men. He scouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">'round the house till he found a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening between a foundation log and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Through this opening he shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rifles one after the other at the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch of his arm. He threw several hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuls of earth into the opening, and tamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a vigorous boot-toe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Them rifles may not be needed," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected, "but a extra ace in a deal like this</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't to be sneezed at."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned to the front of the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gazed across the flats. The retreating</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures, of the marshal and Mr. Scattergood</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dots in the distance. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping a remarkably straight course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guess I'll get the li'l hoss," said Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson, "so's I can turn loose these cows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No use waitin' no longer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He picked up the blanket bundle and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle and walked swiftly back to his horse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He awakened the dozing animal, tied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle into his slicker, swung up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trotted to the corral. He opened the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">without dismounting and rode in. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove out every cow. Whirling a doubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope and yelling at the top of his lungs he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove those cows west and north. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent an active hour, and when he ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shout and spur the cattle were scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the draws and hollows of a region several</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles square.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothin' like scatterin' the evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they won't find it in a hurry, is they?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he inquired of the horse. "C'mon, feller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll go back to the creek an' give yuh one</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine li'l drink, an' then me'n you'll sift along</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Marysville."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stars were out when Henderson rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tired horse into Marysville. He dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted in front of Judge Allison's house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The judge was standing on the porch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson could see the white gleam of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt-sleeves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's me, Judge," he said, stepping upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the porch, "Bill Henderson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With the accent on the Henderson,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered the judge, gripping his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmly. "I'll have Black Sam attend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your horse. You'll stay with me, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It might look better if I stayed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel, Judge," said Henderson softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that's it. I might have known.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll eat with me, though. I shan't take</seg><seg type="columnLine">'No' on that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I've always liked yore grub,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judge. I'll be right back soon's I go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel an' get me a bed an' see the li'l</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoss fed. I got a small pack here I'd like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave with yuh, an' I wouldn't want for</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody to see it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll put it in the sideboard where I keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">my whisky. The doors are always locked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henderson handed the blanket bundle</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the judge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kind o' damp an' heavy," he cautioned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and returned to his waiting horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left his mount at the hotel corral,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bespoke horse-feed, and made good his</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim to a bed by the simple method of</seg><seg type="columnLine">piling his war-bags on an unoccupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">cot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he passed through the barroom on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the street a man entered. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dunlavy, the Wells Fargo agent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When's Sam Bellows cornin' back?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dunlavy asked the bartender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dunno," replied the bartender.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson sat down on a chair, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly rolled a cigaret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't he say?" persisted Dunlavy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If he had I'd tell yuh.

"Yuh won't do no collectin' here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dunlavy departed swearing. Henderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoked his cigaret to the butt, bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">some cigars for his friend, the judge, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out into the street and walked un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly to the latter's house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Judge," said Henderson, when Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam had served the supper, and the kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was shut, "I might want to ask a favor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yuh tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say when," smiled the judge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I might ask a couple o' fellers in here</seg><seg type="columnLine">so's I can talk to 'em private-like."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The house is yours." Judge Allison</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved a plump and hospitable hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm obliged.

"Legal advice."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sometimes I wish I was not a judge,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">grieved the jurist, "or that Justice was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to be blind. Are you planning</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything illegal? Never mind," he added</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily. "Don't tell me. I'd rather not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. But if you have in view a smoky</seg><seg type="columnLine">session, wouldn't the corral do as well? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dislike to seem discourteous or lacking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospitality, but--I rather value the mirror</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my sideboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm gamblin' they won't be no smoke,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson assured him.

Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some more coffee? No? Well then, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a drink. That whisky came to me from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louisville a month ago. It's thirty years</seg><seg type="columnLine">old, smooth as honey and mellow as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripe Sheepnose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, I will have a little nip."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later in the evening Henderson and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge strolled into the Bound-to-Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saloon, whose enterprising proprietor, keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to provide the honest dollar with other</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a liquid outlet, ran games in the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The judge inserted his ample bulk in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">game of stud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henderson did not play. He moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimlessly about, when he wasn't talking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bartender, and drifted into the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">before eleven o'clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the Bound-to-Come he went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thanksgiving, where likewise men could</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink or play cards as the spirit moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Here again Henderson did not pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a hand, and here again he held casual</seg><seg type="columnLine">converse with the bartender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before midnight was thirty minutes old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson was asleep on his cot at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE morning he repaired to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office of the judge and borrowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, pen and ink. He consumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the better part of an hour in filling several</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheets of legal cap with spacious hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He read through his completed work with</seg><seg type="columnLine">care, decided that he had been sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">specific, and made two meticulous copies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which being done he signed the lot, placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">original and copies in three separate en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopes and handed them to the judge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I ain't back by ten o'clock," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson, "or if anythin' happens to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, yuh might open one o' them en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopes an' read what's inside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right," smiled Judge Allison, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pigeon-holed the envelopes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the judge's house Henderson went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the general store of Mr. Eliphalet Scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tergood. The owner was assisting his clerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the unpacking of sundry cases of "air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tights." Mr. Scattergood looked much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse for wear. He had changed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, but the appearance of his face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cramped manner in which he moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms and legs would have led any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">without knowledge of the facts into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief that a mule, or other equally muscular</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal, had assaulted Mr. Scattergood with</seg><seg type="columnLine">intent to kill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henderson bought tobacco and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited upon by the clerk. Henderson</seg><seg type="columnLine">went away in search of the marshal. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman was found in his office. He too</seg><seg type="columnLine">had changed his clothes. He too had</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly been engaged in desperate con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flict. To manifest the slightest curiosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning the troubles of other men is</seg><seg type="columnLine">tabu in cowland circles. Henderson gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">without interest upon the marshal's beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mornin', Marshal," was Henderson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting, uttered in a harsh, hoarse tone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wanna sell some cows--three-year olds?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sell 'em if I get my price," the marshal</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted sourly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe now we can get together on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">price--if she ain't too steep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How many djuh want?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Depends on the price. Listen here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ain't even got time to ride out to yore</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch an' inspect any cattle. You'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drive--in here, an' the judge'll look 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">over for me. He knows cows an' he's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend o' mine. Le's go down to his place</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' fix it up."</seg><seg type="columnLine">High Pockets</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The marshal nodded, stood up stiffly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tenderly, and stiffly and tenderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckled on his six-shooter. The gun had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen service, but the holster and the car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tridge-belt were brand new.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the two came in sight of Judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allison's house the jurist was sitting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front porch. A weighty calf-bound volume</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay open across the judicial knees. He gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">them an abstracted "Good morning" as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they drew near and went on with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About the cattle deal yo're gonna help</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with, Judge," said Henderson, not for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting to speak hoarsely and harshly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can we use yore dinin'-room till we get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">price settled?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By all means, Bill. Make yourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">at home." The judge wondered where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson had picked up that sudden cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We might want yuh to help us out later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judge--if yo're 'round."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be in my office when you want me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've three hours' work ahead on a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting case, so take your time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The judge ushered them into the dining-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and crossed the hall to his office and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the door. Henderson closed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining-room door. In through the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">side-windows, from the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corral, floated the trilling lilt of Black Sam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle making melody of "Beulah Land."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no danger of that which Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson intended saying to the marshal being</seg><seg type="columnLine">overheard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The marshal let himself carefully down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a chair. Henderson took a key from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket. The marshal glanced at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">key, then rapidly and unbelievingly winked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his one available eye. For Henderson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand held a gun, and the round</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle of the gun gaped across the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the marshal's chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put yore hands on the table, Marshal,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson requested in his natural tone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The marshal slowly spread his hands flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the table. He licked his tongue catwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his dry and puffy Ups.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"By Gawd!" he whispered. "By Gawd!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yo're rememberin' the lonesome road-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent, huh?" Henderson queried cheerfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The marshal's face was expressionless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson, without losing for an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magic of the drop, backed to the side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, slid the hand holding the key behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and opened the sideboard door.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officer was not deceived. He could feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hard muzzle of the six-shooter nudging</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ribs. Arm in arm the two entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge's office. Judge Allison, overflowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tip-tilted chair, his feet on the window-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sill, was enjoying a cigar and reading the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calf-bound volume.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can I use yore desk a minute, Judge?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Henderson, skilfully concealing the six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooter under the flap of his vest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly," replied Judge Allison, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out turning his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HENDERSON seated the marshal</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the desk.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap had been fairly sprung.

Nevertheless he managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to effect a conventional, if somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried, withdrawal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The judge stared wonderingly out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. He thought of the marshal's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruised face, the scratching of a hurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen and the speedy fashion of the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">packing off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is interesting," mused Judge Alli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son.

Mr. Scattergood started</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously. Henderson smiled. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not drawn his gun, but his washed-out gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were alert as a hungry tiger's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Might as well sit down," he suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They sat with much scraping of chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs.

Henderson leaned back agaiUst the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideboard. One thumb was caught in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt.

Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson saw him, too, and began to speak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain gray pony that he was positive</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Blythe would enjoy riding. Out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye-corners he continued to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellows.

But that sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation was but a ripple to the wave of feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that engulfed him now. He stared. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes held his unwaveringly. He trembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an over-ridden horse. There was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears a buzzing astif countless bees. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to speak and couldn't. He gulped</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a schoolboy and passed a shaking hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tha-tha's fine," he finally managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stammer out, and incontinently lied to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven of refuge, the log at the hotel corral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whatsa matter with me?" he asked him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self furiously.

One perceived the lurking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everythin's fixed this end," observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson. "Sing Luey's kitchen door</seg><seg type="columnLine">at nine o'clock will be about right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It should," said the Rainbow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Instead of a glass, I guess we'll make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bottle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will be better. So long, old-timer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">see you later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Rainbow whirled Windigo and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT HALF-PAST nine o'clock in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening Henderson and Chuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morgan walked into the dance-hall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chuck Morgan took position at the bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the door. But Henderson did not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sat down across the room on a chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing the bar. Henderson had a bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. At times he appeared to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and healthy pulls at that bottle. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not manifest to the naked eye that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson's tongue corked the bottle every</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he tilted it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd in the Dewdrop was not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">large as on the previous evening. Kansas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casey and a fair sprinkling of prominent</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens were present together with several</seg><seg type="columnLine">riotous Bar S punchers engaged in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasing business of spending two months'</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay. But of those six gentlemen that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">assisted Casey in the. subduing of Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellows only one, a quiet-eyed person</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Kane, was in attendance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It may have been that the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Bellows himself had something to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their absence. For Sam was slouching</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a chair in a far corner. From under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath his shading hat brim he was watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dancers. His attitude and expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">betokened a lazy tranquility of matter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. Now and then he smiled slightly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crookedly. Certainly one could not divine</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dance ended and the couples paraded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar. It was the first occasion since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival of Henderson and Chuck Morgan</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all five of the dance-hall girls had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been at the "bar at the same time. Hen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derson glanced at Chuck. The latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">sauntered across the room and leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall near Henderson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aw-!" exclaimed Henderson drunk-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enly, and dashed his bottle on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the crash the folk drinking at the bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned their heads. It was consistent then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson having seated himself with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">end in mind, that the doorway should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">included in the scope of their vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cork of the shattered bottle had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to roll when a man stepped in from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer dark and halted in the doorway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To all intents and purposes the man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rufe Thompson in the flesh. From boots</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hat his clothing was Rufe Thompson's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood there, thumbs hooked in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt, silently regarding a stricken room-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The unfortunate Snakebite was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">to recover the use of his faculties--recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">them only to lose them instantly. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttering a terrifiic squawk of fright he</seg><seg type="columnLine">foamed at the mouth and fell down in a fit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bartender dived under the bar. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiddler jumped through a window, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him in his flight the sash thereof. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficient Chuck Morgan hopped through</seg><seg type="columnLine">another window to head off the fiddler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But no one paid any attention to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">four and their actions. For one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brunettes, her face gray-blue spotted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">red, was out in the middle of the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming like a lost soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go 'way!" she shrieked at the man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway. "Whatcha hauntin' me for?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't know he was gonna kill yuh! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">swear I didn't! I didn't know what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gonna happen, or I'd never helped! Gawd!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gawd! Don't look at me that way! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't stand it! They made me do itl</seg><seg type="columnLine">They did! They did! Lemme alone! I tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">yuh I didn't know Sam Bellows was gonna</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill yuh!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The brunette gasped, choked, then flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">up her arms and crumpled to the floor in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead faint. Henderson, who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving unobtrusively in the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellows during the brunette's outburst,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went after his gun and leaped forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Bellows likewise leaped--toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dance-hall was of course in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">uproar. The slow-witted folk collided with</seg><seg type="columnLine">and impeded their quick-thinking brothers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calloway, tripping over a chair, fell against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson's gun-hand and knocked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upswinging six-shooter to the floor. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">though this were not enough the blundering</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calloway, scrambling to regain his balance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove the point of his shoulder into the pit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Henderson's stomach. Which stomach</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well-muscled, but it gave under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow and the gun in Henderson's waistband</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly slid down inside his trousers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed its barrel in his boot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As yet not a shot had been fired, and Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellows was astride a window sill. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a fair way to escape when the red-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, swift to discern a heaven-sent oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity for revenge, hurled herself across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervening space and wound her arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his leg. Bellows, snarling, sought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw his six-shooter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both Henderson's guns were out of reach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but lie had one card left to play. His right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand flashed to the back of his neck. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a twinkle of steel in the lamplight, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicious whir in the smoky air, and Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bellows, a nine-inch bowie pinning his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to his thigh, fell back into the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time Henderson, Kansas Casey</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the quiet-eyed citizen, Kane, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandaged Sam Bellows, Chuck Morgan</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned marching ahead of him the fiddler</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mr. Tom Stute. The latter, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken arm still in a sling, was attired</seg><seg type="columnLine">solely in a nightshirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Caught Stute slidin' out to his corral</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I was goin' after the fiddler," ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained Chuck Morgan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was feeling feverish," averred Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stute, forcing a smile. "I guess I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little delirious perhaps.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked glumly at Sam Bellows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fiddler said nothing. He was agi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatedly gnawing his nails and staring about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with scared eyes. In this he was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one with many another in the Dewdrop</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dance-Hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whu-where's that ghost?" the fiddler</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is he?" demanded Kansas Casey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambling to his feet.

"I'm tellin' yuh-- by Gawd!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where's that barkeep?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henderson ran behind the bar. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bartender had vanished. Henderson ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the street.

The slurring drum dwindled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">died out.

Inside it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dried mud with its wisps of dead ferns</seg><seg type="columnLine">and water lilies, they were safe from rifie-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire from the house, and a group of picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">men gathered for another dash forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while they answered the shots from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows of the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ferez and McCune stood safely in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle of the wall by the gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We could wheel them inside," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCune of the guns. "A little to one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the palms would not interfere, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the windows clear while the rush was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. With a beam to break in the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place will be ours in ten minutes. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountain gives us a ready-made bullet-proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug-out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ferez beamed. His captain was truly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich find. Step by step he had cleared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way with the guns, and they had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed once. There seemed an uncanny</seg><seg type="columnLine">brotherhood between their death-dealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">black muzzles with their complicated, sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitive interiors, and this Americano. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequence of it, his loss had been only</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to make his men bold, eager, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">add to their spirits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is well, senor," said Ferez. "I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">give the order to get the beam ready, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill Estreda's fountain to the brim with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">best fighting men, and you, my Captain, be</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful, for after all, there must be a leader,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one such is worth a fountain full of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bravest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A MESSENGER stopped the prep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aration, for so urgent was his news</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Ferez and McCune ran across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bullet-swept plaza to the roof of a house</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its border, where protected by a facade</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shots behind them, they could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the harbor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the Rainbow!" exclaimed McCune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly believing that it could be true, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">while they looked the American warship</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a stop, the anchor chain went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a rumble, as boat booms were rigged</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and gangways dropped in place, in true</seg><seg type="columnLine">man-o'-war style. The Rainbow's captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been on this station too long not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the value of the unexpected. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had implied that the Rainbow was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her base, and then run back to see how his</seg><seg type="columnLine">charges were behaving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the custom?" demanded Ferez,</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious at the interruption, with victory in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. "What will be done?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later he could have had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain ashore for dinner, and all would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been well. But what now?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick, Senor McCune!" he urged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McCune shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid it's all off. I have seen them</seg><seg type="columnLine">do this too often. They'll come ashore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Estreda will tell them all about it, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will either have to go home in peace, or be</seg><seg type="columnLine">chased away by the Rainbow's guns."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we have the victory," argued</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferez. "You say so yourself. Estreda is</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaten. Why is it they should take sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him against me, instead of me against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him? I'm the stronger, is it not so?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hard luck," said McCune, "but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble is that we recognize the 'Ins'</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the 'Outs' every time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We?" questioned Ferez.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little sadly McCune pointed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg pardon, senor, 'they.' There will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be an officer with a police guard at first, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">following that a landing party and heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, if both sides are not good. I'd call</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men and get safely out of the way, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine-guns, of course. We have lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty few as it is, and when the Rainbow</seg><seg type="columnLine">does get away--she won't stay long if all</seg><seg type="columnLine">is quiet--we'll slip down here again and do</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For McCune the joy had gone out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure. He only wanted to get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">now safe from recognition. Ferez turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a well-feigned air of resignation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is Fate, senor," he shrugged. "I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">attend to everything. You had best get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away first. Take two men as a guard. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road outside the city I will join you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As you say, perhaps another time we will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more successful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As McCune slipped from the roof the boat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Rainbow came alongside the boat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing and discharged an officer and ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors. McCune's one idea as he dodged</seg><seg type="columnLine">along from building to building out of sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Estreda's marksmen, was not to be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his comrades.* He had not even both-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered to take the guards that Ferez had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested. Then he slowed down, stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and before he had gone half a dozen blocks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was creeping back stealthily, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing the exact reason, unless as always</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was acting on impulse, and there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a glint in the back of Senor Ferez's eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he so easily gave up a victory almost won.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Or it might have been that he came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see his comrades again, all in white, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their jaunty hand-sewed hats, loose blouses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flaring trousers. White, too, of skin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clean all through. How long had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">been since he had seen ten men, all white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">together? Whatever his motive, it found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at last on a roof, overlooking the plaza,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this is what he saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First, Senor Ferez had not withdrawn his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and the plaza was strangely, ominous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly silent. Only an occasional shot from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof, from a doorway, from the fountain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the courtyard, kept Estreda's men in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">places, and they had almost ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer since help was at hand, for Estreda</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the rule that the "Ins" should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">protected, and wondered a little at Ferez's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupidity in not getting his men away while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McCune was puzzled at first, but from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage-point he could see every detail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferez had withdrawn his men from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoreward side of the plaza and wall. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two macliine-guns were hidden in a flaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle beside the gate. This left the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">up which the sailors marched clear. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appearance of being deserted and harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Close against the courtyard wall came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing-party from the Rainbow. Ensign</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jennings was two paces ahead of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">column of twos headed by Dick Reasoner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even at that distance McCune recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reasoner's breadth of shoulder, and his half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slou'ching, yet springy step, and his whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of latent power and strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">held in reserve. His heart moved out</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward this man. He was glad to see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Dictionary Dick at least had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient and kind and long-suffering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So taken was McCune with this that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">column was a third of the way down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Frayed Strand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wall toward the gate, before the full mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of Ferez's trickery came to him, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the courtyard in the abandoned foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain'Ferez had made a new disposition of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces. Of the twenty men who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheltered there, only two had their rifles</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed at Estreda's house. The others</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced the wide gate, rifles laid along the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cracked cement. Also across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courtyard outside the wall, ladders had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed, and more rifles pointed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong side of the loopholes toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate entrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ferez had not meant to give up, after all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since the American ship had come unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectedly, it should help instead of hindering</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plans. At least in this way there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare chance, better than ignominiously ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepting defeat. The plan was very simple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the sailors came from behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter of the wall and into the gateway, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would open fire on them from the fountain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from the wall almost behind Estreda's</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. There were eleven, and some, one or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, perhaps, would escape to the ship with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the story that the house in the plaza had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired on them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime, Ferez would withdraw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men, to the flanking houses outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, still keeping Estreda's men at bay</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the courtyard. Then on them would</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall the wrath of the ship's guns, and Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treda's power would be wiped out forever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes, it was a good plan. Ferez chuckled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it, and on the opposite wall with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharpshooters waited to give the signal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the picked men in the fountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clay McCune had no struggle with him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self as to what he should do, no false idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of loyalty to his master, Bull Ferez. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw only that his shipmates, white men</seg><seg type="columnLine">like himself, his friend Dick Reasoner, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to go up against a deadly piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">native trickery. He ran to the rear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">low house, and slid feet first to the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodged around the buildings into the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plunged madly forward across the plaza</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the advancing sailors. He ran with</seg><seg type="columnLine">both hands up, shouting, "Stop!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoiled utterly Ferez's chance of surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kill him," ordered the dictator, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the signal to fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bullets thudded into the dust, glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the scattered paving blocks, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped by overhead almost silently with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cold breath of death, but at this un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected appearance of the gringo gone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">amuck, Ferez's men fired uncertainly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCune made the shelter of the wall un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt, and jumped across the deadly gate en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance, in time to be recognized, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Bull Ferez was not one to give up</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily. His hand had been forced, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to play it out. There was still left a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good opportunity to make an attack on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors, and have it credited to Estreda, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">only McCune were killed, and on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance he signaled his picked men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowl of the fountain to charge. Ignoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that Estreda might open fire at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their backs, they obeyed their chief prompt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, ran down the palm-bordered walk, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst from the gate, firing as they came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of a surprised, uncertain group</seg><seg type="columnLine">in close order, which Ferez had counted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">routing in a swift attack, the native soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">met prepared resistance, for McCune had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen them coming as he crossed the gate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flat on their faces, deployed to the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage, the sailors poured in a searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">volley at close range, which sent the soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying back to the gate's ornamental</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaches, and what shelter they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find for sniping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ferez stormed impotently, first at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure of his plan, and then at his own men</seg><seg type="columnLine">as group after group lying quiescent in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding buildings according to orders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined the fight against the sailors. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight gringoes, especially when they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">outnumbered, was a chance in a lifetime,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were rapidly getting out of hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are too many for us," said En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign Jennings. "We'li get out of this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fall back, and take advantage of all cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">until we can find a better place to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dodging swiftly across the plaza, stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping to fire from tree trunks, and door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, the sailors made their way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of the street which led to the beach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying their wounded with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll signal for help from here," decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ensign Jennings. "Johnson is bad hit, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it hurts him to be carried without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretcher."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But already the landing-party in force</seg><seg type="columnLine">was under way. The Rainbow's captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard the outburst of firing, and knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country too well to take a chance. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the crowded boats speeding to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescue, and the toll which the sailors' rifles</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken, brought Ferez's men to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">senses. Hastily he collected them, cursing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his officers, threatening to shoot any man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who disobeyed, and by the time the landing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">party had climbed the hilly street to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small detail entrenched and ready, even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniping had ceased, and Ferez's whole ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedition, with even his wounded and dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on its way back over the mountain to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">own city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Estreda sent down his white flag, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluble in his explanations, and begged for</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection from "the bandit of the north."</seg><seg type="columnLine">So evident was the truth of his story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coupled with McCune's evidence, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain granted his plea for recognition as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">permanent "In," which had been denied</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, and after a week's inspection and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cleaning up of several reform measures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Rainbow sailed away, leaving the es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timable Seiior Estreda happy and estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished, safe from marauding neighbors, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured of reelection, if the machinery which</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far had never failed, continued to work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     THE manner of McCune's coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pgpl back aboard the Rainbow elevated</seg><seg type="columnLine">him far above an ordinary deserter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a scuttle-butt rumor got about that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishment was to be light. So far he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken his place in his old division, and swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hammock in his old billet. In due</seg><seg type="columnLine">course of time, preferably when officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">from another ship could take part, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a court-martial. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">method in this, for the captain wanted to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">how McCune would knuckle down to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">after his experience ashore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "McCune's making good," announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Slim" Higgins. "He's settling down like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fellow whose chief sport was collecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">hash marks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick Reasoner agreed heartily, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartily, and Slim caught the false note.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're not sure!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing's sure." said Reasoner, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">why poke into things with the sharp end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a stick?

Reasoner took it as a good and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeful omen in the man's character, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not as conclusive evidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The week in the harbor at La Combra</seg><seg type="columnLine">was followed by a week at sea. The Rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow's captain had a habit of running away</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then to deep, open water to clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain, and that of his crew, of the island's</seg><seg type="columnLine">witchery of indolent carelessness, its cease-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less fermenting of selfish interests. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">days at sea were filled to the brim with drills,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with target-practise, with exacting routine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but men and officers came back to theii</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties with new snap and decision to apply</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their work, with a wider perspective, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides keeping the natives guessing which</seg><seg type="columnLine">port would receive the next call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that week Clay McCune's presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the Rainbow became a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. He was fitted again to the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, lost the savor of romance with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shipmates had clothed his desertion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in consequence suffered a return of his old</seg><seg type="columnLine">restlessness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as before, the Rainbow dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchor in Port Antonio. For two days the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain had impressed on Ferez the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Estrada's territory was tabu. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">night of the second day--soft, warm, en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanting--and Reasoner and McCune sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sea-chest with the old problem still</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsolved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They won't let me go ashore," com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained McCune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "First-class men for daylight liberty</seg><seg type="columnLine">only," said Reasoner.

If they were forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispose of the booty to the "fence" who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually allied with them, but who squeezed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them of every possible cent, while the hue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cry was still in full force, they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbed, as usual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if they could scatter, each with</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough money to live on for a month or so--</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes, Red was right.

He kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembering the last time he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, just before he was "nabbed." There</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a fight, that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, here were all sorts of things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed by a woman and two babies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was Maggie, without the inevitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigaret, without the flash of diamonds--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maggie in a white waist and an oddly sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dued manner. There was Larry, talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way Larry could, but seldom did; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Smoke, silent, with clean hands; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was McGurk, sneaking up the back stairs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at the new arrival, and remaining to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stare, open-mouthed, at Jumbo, until a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowl sent him scurrying below, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">without the upward flung echo of a laugh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, most of all, there was the amazing, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disconcerting, the incredible sensation ot</seg><seg type="columnLine">two warm little bodies, snuggled against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and the fragrance of their dainty little</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves in his nostrils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It got on toward noon. Usually, McGurk</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent up a lunch from the saloon below</seg><seg type="columnLine">to as many of the gang as might be on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. What should be done under these</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances? Red Jumbo, gradually get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting over his state--or, rather, getting used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it--raised his eyebrows at Maggie, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the mother of the twins who answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question which they were all asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been smelling your dinner for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, Mrs. Mason," she said, "and I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want to go and look after it.

Larry went down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner, where there was a cheap florist</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought back a big bunch of the small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow roses which are Virginia's most dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctive flower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maggie sniffed the spicy odor thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We usta have a big bush of these," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, to nobody in particular.

Once, without their asking, Maggie</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped and gathered them fiercely into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arms, but they were not frightened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They hugged back with their strong little</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, and kissed her tenderly, when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw tears in her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Lawton brought back a basket filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the brim, and a strangely silent man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But she, herself, bubbled over with good</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits.

To Larry, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not strange, but it was dreadful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To Smoke, it was queer, but umneaning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To Jumbo, who had never heard its like be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, it was a part of the confusion which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slowly taking its grip upon his soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      THE dinner was an unqualified suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess, even to Smoke, who surveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass of water beside his plate</seg><seg type="columnLine">with extreme distaste. But before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could say anything the twins, solemnly</seg><seg type="columnLine">folding their fat hands, bowed their heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">and murmured:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For yis meal, God make us tooly sank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful. Amen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maggie and Larry and Red, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily ducked their heads, in accord with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Lawton's, were crimson at the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion of the little ceremony; especially as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they met the sardonic grin of Smoke who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had chosen to fill in time by eating the cole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaw at his plate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They fingered over the meal, strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">loath to break up the association of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. It was fairly quiet. The season</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not really opened, yet, and most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"attractions" at the beach were still closed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The late afternoon sun came slithering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">while they still sat on. Beulah and Lulu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite their mother's remonstrance, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to Jumbo's lap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I haven't felt so happy since poor Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taken from me," Mrs. Lawton said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She pushed back her chair, humming a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune. She broke off a rose and pushed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">through her heavy dark hair. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful, faint color in her cheeks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes were sweet and deep. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">probably never been beautiful, but she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something more compelling than that; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone with a sort of glory. Red Jumbo</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at her so steadily that she blushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little. Then, swiftly, she turned around</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the piano, and broke out into a clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunting contralto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She sang "Absent," and "Juanita," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Old Black Joe," "The Harbor Bar" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Rocked In The Cradle of The Deep."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every time that she stopped and swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">around they begged her to go on. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned forward in their chairs, as the twi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light settled on them, and gave themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to her, and she took their hearts with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, far, far from anything they had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. Then, when it was too dark to see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she began something, and the two children,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stirring, piped up with her-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jesus loves me, this I know, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bible tells me so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smoke snorted and tramped down-stairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Maggie and Larry and Jumbo, shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their chairs, did not move, and Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lawton, when that song was done, began</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nearer my God to Thee."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She got up after she had finished that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I reckon that will be good night for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">babies," she remarked, casually. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you folks must be tired of listening to me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She moved toward the door, but Beulah</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Lulu objected. They wanted to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">kissed "dood night;" they wanted to hug</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jumbo; they wanted "Mis'er Lawy" to goas</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as the hall; they wanted "Aunt Maggie"</seg><seg type="columnLine">to promise to tuck them in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid my little girls are too wilful,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mother said, over her shoulder, as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally led them away. "I've spoiled them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They could hear her singing, in Maggie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, as she undressed the babies. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Maggie lit the gas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smoke came up the stairs, treading</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jes' bin out t' look around," he whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered.

He took them out of his dirty, striped</seg><seg type="columnLine">cotton shirt, and pushed them carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hay just above his head. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully, for the pistol was all that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left to remind him of his father, "Ironhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill" Faley; and the worn, old second</seg><seg type="columnLine">reader had been given to him as a story-</seg><seg type="columnLine">book by the meek and long-suffering little</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother before the cataclysm--it was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good Book, verily, his Shannon's Code of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Life, his history and encyclopedia of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he went to sleep and dreamed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tailor and the king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the bright dawn he awoke with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind filled with thoughts of kings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">queens. Would there be a royal family in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiie little lowland city down there? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked himself the question in all seriousness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You see, he was only twelve years old, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew the world only through hearsay</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that beloved second reader; he believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">every blessed word that was in the book,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and less than half of that which hehadlieard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he took the old pistol from the hay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked for the twentieth time since he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left Laurel Gap to see that it was loaded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slipped it inside his shirt. If there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a king, he was ready and anxious to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">that monarch's enemies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fight? David Faley? His middle name</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been fight. The men of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">people had fought themselves to death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Literally, fought themselves to death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ironhead Bill had been the chief of the clan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When Bill Faley and his little son were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only Faleys left in the Laurel Gap country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had fled to North Carolina. Ironhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill was heartbroken and sick over his wife's</seg><seg type="columnLine">untimely passing, and no longer able to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle to the Wansleys, who were legion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in the North Carolina hills he had died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But never for a minute were those hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">home to the boy David. He had made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way back to Laurel Gap to find that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was an outcast, a pariah, simply because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was a Faley. One old woman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown him a moldy pone of cornbread,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one throws a bone to a dog, and that was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the single expression of kindliness he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shown him upon his return to Laurel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> David had hurled the moldy bread into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hag's face, and stood her four grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons off with the revolver he carried; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had promised an early funeral to the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who followed him, and put out for that place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mystery that they called johnsville.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the afternoon of that day a farmer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife had given him something to eat for</seg><seg type="columnLine">splitting an armful of stovewood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The' must be a king," he told himself as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he crept out of the haystack.

Then he went down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grassy slope and into the valley. He drank</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a spring brook, made a sort of break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast on apples and berries, and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no sign of a castle, but he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">many houses; houses of brick, and stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wood, but no houses built of whole logs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">David went slowly down the main business</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. The signs he saw over doors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on windows were of fascinating interest to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; he spelled them all out, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very proud of his ability to read--none of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the- Wansleys, he remembered, could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">read. There were more lawyers than any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else, it seemed, and he didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a lawyer was!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He asked a passer-by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A lawyer?" frowned the man, a cynic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without doubt. "A lawyer, son, is a liar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man walked on. David stood look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing soberly at his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A lawyer is a liar," muttered the lad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. "No Faley couldn't be a lawyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. A Faley never told a lie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had been their redeeming feature; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been their religion--"A Faley never</seg><seg type="columnLine">told a lie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly David halted before a tailor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign, and his brown eyes brightened. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was opened invitingly, and he walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. A middle-aged man with a hook-nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned over a showcase, looked over a pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brass-rimmed spectacles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, son?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">With Pistol and Second Reader</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whar does the king live?" David asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The king! Which King? Jim King,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or George King, or Hennery? Look here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you little ragamuffin, you ain't tryin' to</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw me, are you? If you are, by Jupiter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll smack your jaws for you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tailor walked around the showcase.</seg><seg type="columnLine">David stared, and he was a little white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps the tailor had dyspepsia; anyway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was sour enough for vinegar. He caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Faley by the ear, and the next moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was looking into the one black eye of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol-barrel!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turn it loose!" snapped David; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other obeyed with an alacrity that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ludicrous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Police!" yelled the frightened, hook-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosed man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Police? What was that? David won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in another moment he knew. A long</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm in a blue sleeve shot over his shoulder;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pistol was seized and wrenched from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his grip; a heavy hand caught him by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">collar of his dirty cotton shirt and dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him roughly to the sidewalk. David twist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed half-around, looked upward, and saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">face that was leering and brutish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Faley struck that face with his brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">little fist, struck it as hard as he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike, and he had the sweet satisfaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of seeing a crimson fluid that was not red</seg><seg type="columnLine">ink start from the policeman's nose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly the officer pocketed Ironhead Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Faley's revolver and caught the boy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists in both hands, and it hurt. David</seg><seg type="columnLine">went paler, but not a sound escaped his lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor did a tear come to his eyes; it had long</seg><seg type="columnLine">been his boast that nobody had ever been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to make him cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll come wi' me," growled the police-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man; and he jerked the boy clear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewalk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a strong, lean hand dropped on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer's shoulder from behind, and he halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as suddenly as though he had been shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> David heard a voice saying sharply:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you feel that you've got to manhandle</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody, Sayler, try manhandling me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You must treat the kid white, Sayler;</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE boy looked upward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. He saw a tall and lean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen-eyed, smooth-faced man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about twenty-seven; a man who wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad-brimmed black hat, a perfectly white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt and collar, a black string-tie, a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit of clothes, and a pair of expensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish boots. He had been riding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll have to take him before Judge Bliss,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lew," Sayler said quite meekly. "He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gun, and he tried to shoot Tom Larkin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lew Tannehill, real eastern Tennessee</seg><seg type="columnLine">aristocrat, looked down at the lad with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amused, half-whimsical smile. David Faley</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned his gaze without a sign of flinching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Tannehill agreed, "you'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A crowd had gathered, of course, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd followed Johnsville's chief of police</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only policeman and his youthful pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner to the magistrate's office. Tannehill</seg><seg type="columnLine">was among them. In fact, he led them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Walter Bliss had been a circuit-court</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge for more years than he had toes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they still called him "Judge" Bliss. Now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an attorney, a real-estate dealer, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">magistrate; he was big and bald, and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-sighted. As the crowd began to file</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his office, he adjusted his glasses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled in his desk chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Sayler, what's this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sayler halted the boy at the railing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood between him and Johnsville's magis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate, surrendered the pistol that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pride of Bill Faley's heart, and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">all he knew of the "attempted assault."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Larkin bore out the policeman's state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. A sort of trial was held, and David</seg><seg type="columnLine">was asked many questions concerning him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Through it all Lew Tannehill took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the juvenile prisoner's part; he pleaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy's case with a moving eloqubnce</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed as natural with him as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Judge Bliss listened attentively to this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was easy to see that he had no love what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever for Tannehill, but he was courteous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if cold. The bare truth of the matter was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he hated Tannehill and was too well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bred to show it. Walter Bliss, too, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">real Tennessee aristocrat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The magistrate was in a quandary. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unaccustomed to being called upon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">decide cases such as this. He glanced to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward Tannehill as though he would ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice; then he caught himself, changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his glance to an icy stare and shifted it</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll vouch for the boy," said Tannehill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I need a boy in my office, and I'll give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place. As for the legal side of it, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think this is a thing that might be left</seg><seg type="columnLine">86</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely to the discretion of the court;</seg><seg type="columnLine">though you understand, sir, I'm not trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to advise you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well, Lewis," Bliss replied bluntly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Very well, you take charge of him. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll expect you to see that he behaves him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tannehill took the boy's arm and smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's go, son. It's all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll not go without my gun," protested</seg><seg type="columnLine">David, 'it was my daddy's!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it will be safe here," Tannehill</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured him. "It's too heavy to lug</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, and it's unlawful. So let's just</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave it with the judge; he'll take good care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly, sir; certainly!" said Judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bliss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Faley permitted himself to be led</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to the street, down the street half the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of a city block, up-stairs and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">an office room over the drug-store. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">he halted and looked around him. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">books by the hundred, a table littered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspapers, chairs, a rolltop desk, pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wall. On the door, which stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, he spelled out words that told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his big friend was a lawyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he turned his serious brown eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the eyes of Tannehill, he was disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed, hurt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you're a liar," he muttered, "and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore did like you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most all men are liars," laughed Tanne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill, "at one time or another."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Faleys wasn't," said David. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll pass it. Why did you ask Larkin</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the king lived? Where did you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">that king idea?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out came the old second reader. David</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not mentioned it during his trial; if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they took his "gun," mightn't they also</seg><seg type="columnLine">take his story-book? The two sat down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and David read to Tannehill the story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tailor and the king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's whar I got it," he said tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphantly, when he had finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first, Tannehill was inclined to laugh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he began to look thoughtful, and a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding came. Poor little boy! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated to break that pretty dream; far too</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the dreams of the world's dreamers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been broken, already. He thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, never to be forgotten, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had learned the truth about Santa Claus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he bent forward and took one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">David Faley's dirty little hands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Son," he said, "by coming to Johnsville</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've won something and lost something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What you've won, the future only can show</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. What you've lost--I swear, I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather take a horsewhipping than to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, lad, but there are no kings and queens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no knights and ladies, no princes and prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cesses, like those in that book. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">are--well, they are just story-people; don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A long talk followed, and it hurt them</seg><seg type="columnLine">both. David saw, and he believed, at last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was noontime when it was over. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, half-sick with disillusionment, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his friend toward the great old brick</seg><seg type="columnLine">home of the Tannehills for dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was on this little journey that David</seg><seg type="columnLine">first saw the girl. She was about twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four, tall and exceedingly pretty; she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes, and hair that was only a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker than the color of old-gold. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">she saw Tannehill, she blushed, and Tanne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill whispered as he passed her:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Four o'clock.

Finally he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may call me 'Grandpa' whenever</seg><seg type="columnLine">you like, David."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were many times afterward when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought of the incident, and always he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was glad that he had granted the first wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the boy expressed. For the two were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicker than beans in a bag long before a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frost fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Summer ran on, and Johns-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ville came to know the Faley as</seg><seg type="columnLine">"the Tannehill boy," and the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of August came. Then it was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">David learned the secret. Two secrets, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be exact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On a warm Sunday afternoon, when old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Tannehill was asleep, and old Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tannehill was visiting the minister's wife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Miss Anna had company in the parlor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he couldn't locate Mr. Lew--David</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolled down to the creek and followed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of town. Suddenly he rounded a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend in the brush-lined stream, and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself facing a pretty little dell filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">daisies; and in that dell stood Lew Tanne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill and Judge Bliss' daughter--and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked as tragic as a pair of professional</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shakespearean actors in the last act.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tannehill stood with the girl's hands in his,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the girl's eyes were turned downward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and both of them were bareheaded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since Tannehill's back was turned upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">David, and the girl was looking toward her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, neither knew of the boy's presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">near by. Miss Cordelia began to speak in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's useless, Lew," she said sadly. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's so very painful. For four years it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been like this. There is utterly no hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we'll ever be able to marry. Lew, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustn't love ourselves more than we love</seg><seg type="columnLine">our--our fathers and mothers. I'm con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that we'd better--quit. I'll promise</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that I'll never marry anybody."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> David saw Lew bend forward and kiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Cordelia on the forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not that, Delia," said he. "Not an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eternal good-by!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But father and mother are getting old,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young woman went on, "and some day</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're going to find out that I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">slyly meeting you for four years, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Lew, Lew, I don't think I could bear it!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And they are so very kind to me. They're</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">always giving me pretty things and costly</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. Only yesterday father gave me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">milk-white saddler that came from Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tucky--oh, such a beautiful horse!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Let me say here parenthetically that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine saddle-horse had been known by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blue Grass keeper as "The White Satan,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that its latest buyer was ■entirely un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquainted with its record; that Judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walter Bliss knew of his daughter's secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">meetings with Lew Tannehill, and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was trying to win his daughter back by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of overpowering kindliness in massed</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation. Hence the pretty things, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the costly things; and the success he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">having was proof that old Walter Bliss</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no stranger to the ways of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw it," said Tannehill. "And it</seg><seg type="columnLine">really is a superb animal. But there's some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire in its eyes yet, and it ought to be better</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken before you ride it. As to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">'quitting'--perhaps you are right, Delia.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll leave it to you. But I hate the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it! It makes the whole world look blue."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All at once David Faley realized that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doing a most ungentlemanly thing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">eavesdropping like that. He stole back</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the creek a hundred yards, took off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoes and stockings, and plunged into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shallow water to wade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour, and Lew Tannehill came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the creek. He carried his hat in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and he seemed very gloomy. At a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point opposite David, he halted, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad waded out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Lew," began the boy, "I heerd part</seg><seg type="columnLine">o' what you and Miss Cordelie said back</seg><seg type="columnLine">thar. I couldn't hardly help it. And ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">sence I heerd it, I've been busy wonderin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">--why cain't you and her marry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had not lost much of his musical hill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawl. Tannehill smiled a little, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">little whimsically, and kicked a stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the creek as though it had offended</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you know, son?" he said after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent minute. "But I guess you don't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It isn't talked of much. Her father and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">father dislike each other a great deal; it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">been like that for years and years. I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily remember the time when they fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">like wildcats on bare sight of each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's queer, too, for they spent their child-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood, boyhood, and the early part of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">manhood as the most inseparable of friends.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They went fishing, hunting, swimming, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">everything, together; where one was, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the other. Then came the quarrel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody seems to remember what it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He couldn't understand, when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished, why he had told the lad. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was his desperation that had done it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For just that afternoon he and Cordelia</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bliss had said what they believed was good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by for all time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why don't they git up a feud," frowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">David, "and use guns and pistols, and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out? That's the way the Wansleys and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Faleys--I mean the Faleys and Wansleys</seg><seg type="columnLine">--done when they got mad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you see how it ended, don't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> David's gaze fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're right. Yes, I see. Makin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends o' yore pap and her'n would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">off all o' the trouble, wouldn't it? Ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">the' no way to make 'em friends?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No way on earth," and Tannehill shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. "You'd as well try to stop the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they went toward home, the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountaineer was thoughtful. He was try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to think of some plan by which he him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self could unite the two old belligerents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was going to be a big job, he told himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If Mr. Lew had found it as impossible as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop the sun, what could he do?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he didn't give up. He owed Lew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tannehill too much to give up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now if the boy Faley was anything, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cunning and resourceful. . He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be that in order to survive in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maelstrom of adverse forces that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his environment from the day, almost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his birth; and he had inherited cunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and resourcefulness from a long line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting ancestors. He was not a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">great while in thinking of a scheme that</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered some promise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But--could he bring himself to do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The difficulty with it was that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to go back on the religion of his people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back on it squarely. David thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the matter day after day, lay in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed and thought over it night after night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It eventually boiled itself down to this, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the crucible:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do I love my own lowdown self more'n</seg><seg type="columnLine">I love Mr. Lew and Miss Cordelie?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, quickly, in the old, stern language</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his fathers--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ef I go to hell for it, I'll try it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I l ON THE next Sunday afternoon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">■LinInfra Walter Bliss took a thick book from</seg><seg type="columnLine">1.71 his library, went to a corner of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad and shady veranda, and ensconced</seg><seg type="columnLine">his huge figure comfortably in a wide wicker</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocker. He had no more than opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">book and adjusted his glasses, when there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the sound of light footfalls on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his right, and he turned his white head</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the Tannehill boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I jest thought I'd come over to see ye,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned David.

And the horse tired of that dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight that it couldn't shake off, slowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, groaned despairingly and stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">squarely in front of Judge Bliss and old</seg><seg type="columnLine">George Tannehill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Cordelia got to the ground somehow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran to the boy.

A dozen neighbors, among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them a doctor, and Johnsville's policeman</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran up.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge fire blazed high in the space between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the row of brush and grass cabins and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river bank where the Frenchmen had</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed, and around this, shrieking, reeling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their naked bodies glistening with perspira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in the firelight, circled the warriors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the band.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Basile,-cool, calculating, with an eye for</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything and every one, poured brandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the greedily extended gourds, but never</seg><seg type="columnLine">until Leon or Michel had first received a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle of furs, and always with an impar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiality that would result in no warrior es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caping the enfiaming consequences of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">debauch. Basile wanted no laggards, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-sober savages, and so unerringly did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">estimate the effects of the liquor on each</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, so skilfully did he apportion the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandy, each man and youth in the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved forward to the successive stages of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunkenness as uniformly as troops maneu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver on a parade-ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The savages danced and yelled about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. They still contained control of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies, though their brains were scorched.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Constantly men broke away, rushed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness and returned with fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundles of furs, which they tossed at Ba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sile's feet before extending their gourds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The brandy was downed at a gulp and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">freshly inflamed, they whirled away into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slirieking circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Except in isolated instances of insolent at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempts to compel larger portions, the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were not molested. Basile had clev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erly implanted the idea in their minds at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning that fur would always bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandy, and nothing else, and automatic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, as the effects wore off, as more stimu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lant was desired, the savages rushed away</seg><seg type="columnLine">for new bundles of pelts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick Jeffreys, though in full view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">orgy, had little time to note the details of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trading. As fast as the fur was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived, the brandy doled out, Leon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michel tossed the skins back to him to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied into bundles and piled on the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank close to the canoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not the demoralization of the war-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">riors, or even the possible danger to the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men should the savages get beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">control, that occupied Dick's mind as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked rapidly over his bales. Brandy, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, had always been an accessory to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fur trade. The savages had come to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect it, and perhaps after all there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm done in thus transporting them into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new world, in furnishing high lights they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not otherwise hope for. Surely noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing had happened so far that could be ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected to, even the huge price paid for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquor. There was no other brandy within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred leagues or more, and everywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply and demand govern price.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was in the attitude of Michel when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had transported the weapons across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, in the cold, scheming actions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile, in a dread of something far worse for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he could find no tangible grounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Dick had his misgivings. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pondered over this, his eyes spared from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work as much as possible, a change came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he turned toward the river, laden with fur,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile looked at the shrieking circle of war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors and then glanced at Michel and Leon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," Michel whispered. "Here is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief himself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader of the savages, his legs becom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing uncertain in their movements, thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself forward and tossed a bundle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaver skins at the feet of the white men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same time his gourd waved uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly toward the cask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are not generous," Basile told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a smile. "Have not your women</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraped these skins? Have they not</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted the maize?

But before 'he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hand his gourd forward the chief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be outdone, demanded a full dipper</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the women of his family. As Basile</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled it, more generously than ever before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief turned and called the names of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">women.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every woman and child in the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been present at the carousal, sitting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circle outside the dancers, adding to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumult, the women even begging some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times for a little of the elixir which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">so to exalt the men. As the chief called</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, three women arose, one tumbling a</seg><seg type="columnLine">child from her lap, and ran forward. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief passed the gourd to them and, amid</seg><seg type="columnLine">much giggling, coughing, sputtering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gibes from the others, the liquor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">downed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warriors immediately clamored for</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandy for their women and in a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile was doling out the fiery stuff faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">than before. Half an hour later every</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman in the circle was as intoxicated as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men and, joining in the dance, they out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped the braves with their shrill screams</seg><seg type="columnLine">and contortions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the advent of the women the char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter of the orgy began to change swiftly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crowd of dancers about the fire was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more dense. One brave stepped on an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's feet and was knocked down. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose, pulled a burning stick from the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">and struck his adversary across the face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding him and sending him reeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the blaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The encounter pleased the crowd and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time aroused a desire for conflict.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several fights started. Two men wrestled</seg><seg type="columnLine">impotently for a time, a yelping circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">demons about them. Then one, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap like that of a fear-maddened beast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit off the other's nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A woman, shrieking hysterically, pulled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning stick from the fire and held it</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the bare back of a dancing warrior.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He cried in agony and then whirled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust the woman into the fire, where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled and fell and then rushed out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side, her hair a blazing torch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On every side personal encounters</seg><seg type="columnLine">started. Without weapons, unable to strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">or wrestle effectively, the savages resorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to snapping and tearing with their teeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Noses and ears were bitten off, chunks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh were ripped from backs and breasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shoulders. Blood flowed down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare bodies of the men and soaked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanty skifa garments of the women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One woman suddenly ran from the circle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched up a sleeping infant from the arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an older child and, with a fiendish shriek,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled it into the center of the flames.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little body writhed for a few moments,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">its skin scorched and crinkled. Then it lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick, stupefied by the horror of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene, did not realize for a time that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more furs were forthcoming, though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gourds were kept full. Basile was assisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dispensation by both Leon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michel. All three worked swiftly, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces alight in anticipation, seemingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblivious of the horror about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last Basile rolled out a cask, knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the head and waved the savages toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. There was a scramble immediately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clattering of gourds drowned out by</seg><seg type="columnLine">yells and screams. Fights were started</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere, blood flowed to the accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paniment of shrieks of anguish. Men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women reeled and weaved about aimlessly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some swayed and fell, to lie motionless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely overcome, or to struggle vainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rise. One warrior stumbled and plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the bank, falling with his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders in the water. His feet kicked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time, but his body only slid farther in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud and at last it disappeared without</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving a ripple on the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, Dick!" cried Leon. "The time</seg><seg type="columnLine">has arrived.

We must be away soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick whirled to see the Frenchman's evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">face scowling at him from above a heap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade-goods with which his arms were laden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile dumped his burden down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank beside the furs and again faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You beast!" cried the Virginian, stung</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last to action by the realization that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions were about to terminate their</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit by stealing all they had traded, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">robbing these unsuspecting, friendly chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren not only of their innocence but even of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very price of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped forward and struck Basile in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face with all his strength. The French-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man reeled against a savage and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursing hysterically, sprang back to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attack. Dick stepped to one side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again his fist found Basile's face. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same instant a stick of wood thrown by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunken warrior sent the Virginian reeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the bank beside the Frenchman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Basile met him, not with a blow, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steadying arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Watch!" he commanded. "The sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages have turned upon us. Leon! Michel!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick whirled at Basile's side to see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of shrieking warriors charging down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them, led by the one against whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile had fallen and who had struck Dick in</seg><seg type="columnLine">retaliation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your fists," advised Basile. "Strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick and hard and don't let them get their</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms about you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Side by side he and Dick met the charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the reeling, crazed savages. Two went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, then a third. But others took their</seg><seg type="columnLine">places and the white men, to evade the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching arms and gleaming teeth, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been forced back into the river had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not Michel and Leon charged into them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with swinging muskets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No more than a dozen Indians had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in the attack. The others, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">uninterested, still circled about the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll attend to you later, English dog!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile whispered in Dick's ear as he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to follow Leon and Michel to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabins and fresh plundering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Frenchmen left Dick standing above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bodies of the savages they load knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">senseless. Instinctively he started after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coureurs dc bois and then his utter help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness in the face of all that had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened broght him up with a start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Indians were mad with liquor, past</seg><seg type="columnLine">control, past help of any kind. Once they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had recovered, once they learned all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been done to them, their desire for</seg><seg type="columnLine">vengeance would be boundless. Now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage had been done. Dick could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope to escape with the Frenchmen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle with Basile afterward. '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To rid himself at least of the sight of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">rape of an innocent people the Virginian</seg><seg type="columnLine">started down the bank of the river, seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness beyond the circle of the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He stumbled blindly on among some</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes, stopping only when he heard a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry and sounds of a struggle in front of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same instant a warrior applied a</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch to the grass roof of a cabin and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole village was lighted instantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first rays disclosed to Dick a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl struggling in the arms of Basile. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman's face was red from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratches, but he only laughed and held her</seg><seg type="columnLine">more tightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly Dick was upon him, striking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tearing at his arms, beating his face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and shoulders. Basile dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl with a curse and reached for his knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As it slipped from his belt Dick swung with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his strength and his fist met the French-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's jaw. He dropped silently into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick turned to find the girl watching him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you played with my little brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">today," she began suddenly, "I knew you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not like the others. Now you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved me. So I shall tell you something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save you. My father once journeyed far to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north, to a great lake your people call</seg><seg type="columnLine">Superior. He saw Frenchmen there, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourselves, and he saw them give brandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our people. Today he would not taste of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, nor would he let me, and when you began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give brandy to us he went down the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell the warriors of the next village.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They come soon, and then there will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stakes, and pine splinters, for all of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The seriousness of her manner had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded Dick's attention and, although he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been unable to comprehend all of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech, he had grasped enough of it to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clear idea of her meaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say," he asked, "that your father</seg><seg type="columnLine">will lead the warriors against us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For answer she held up her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen," she said simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A single war-whoop sounded from down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, a cry stabbing through the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and the dying clamor about the fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly Dick stooped and lifted Basile's</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp body. With a struggle he swung it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder and set off along the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the canoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leon! Michel!" he cried as he stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered beneath his burden. "Quick, or we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are lost!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he came to the dance-fire the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchmen, their arms full of loot, rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the canoes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick!" Dick commanded. "To your</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddles. The warriors of the next village</seg><seg type="columnLine">are here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What of it?" demanded Leon. "We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">get them drunk, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they have been warned by one from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this village, one who would not drink, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have been told that we robbed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed after making them mad. It's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stake for all of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense!" Michel retorted. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His words were drowned by a yell from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the village that froze all three for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant. Then as one man they turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoe into which Dick had dumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile, threw in their muskets and leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">after them. Dick in the bow, Michel in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern, Leon kneeling astride his uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious companion, they paddled as they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never paddled before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before they had pulled away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the burning cabin Dick looked over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder to see a stream of naked war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors flow through the circle about the fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a yell, shrill, high above the bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lam of the camp, echoing like the staccato</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry of the wolf that snaps at the haunches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a deer. A glistening arm pointed toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow of the fleeing canoe and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next instant arrows rained on the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIDDEN ENEMIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Islinois River was too wide for</seg><seg type="columnLine">effective archery and the canoe was</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward the opposite bank where,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blending with the shadows, it sped on up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, unseen by the savages and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard, for the paddles dipped noiselessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All three men knew, however, that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not mean safety. Down-stream they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have out-distanced their pursuers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to put leagues of hostile territory</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them and Lac Mecheygan. Up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, following the many convolutions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river, fighting the current, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no hope of escape after daylight came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowing each bend, each shallow place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they could ford or swam, the savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">could easily strike across country and cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">them off at dawn. To abandon the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be equally fatal, for every foot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">both banks would be examined in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the new day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For the present, in the darkness and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river between them and the savages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were safe. A few of the Islinois had</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted to follow in the canoe left behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">but their unfamiliarity with the craft per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted the eoureurs de bois to out-distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">them easily. The three men drove ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all their strength. They could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">their pursuers on the opposite bank, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes an arrow plumped into the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">near them. But the stream was straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broad and with little current for sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral leagues and after an hour there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sounds of the Indians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Basile recovered consciousness at last and</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted to rise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lie still," whispered Leon as he laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside his paddle and placed both hands on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile's shoulders. "Don't speak above a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper. The savages pursue us. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">you feel able to sit up your blade will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I am needed," was the answer, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am well able to paddle now. There are no</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken bones. I only lost all knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life for a time. Where is that dog of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Englishman?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is here, ahead. 'Twas he that car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried you to the canoe, else you would even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now be wearing pine splinters. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind him for the present. It needs the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and skill of all four to escape the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking devils on the bank. It is the stake</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all of us if we are caught. Use your</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade now and settle your quarrels later."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Very well," said Basile as he arose cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously to his knees. "Give me a paddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	can wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well said," Leon encouraged. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work for another league. Then we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop for breath and perhaps a plan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All four now bent to their work and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe was fairly lifted from the water as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paddles went into the stream in perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">unison. They sped on, faster than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians could run on land, and after half</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour Michel called a halt in the shadow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small, heavily wooded island in midriver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have no breath left," he gasped as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took hold of a w'illow branch to anchor the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe. "We can't keep that up for long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there are several big bends beyond.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By morning they will surely be ahead."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And if we did outstrip them we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">only run into the Miamis, who would treat</seg><seg type="columnLine">us no better," said Leon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have a plan," whispered Dick as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turned in the bow. "A quarter of a league</seg><seg type="columnLine">above us a stream comes in from the left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is large enough for the canoe, so large</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must come from some distance. I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member it because Michel and I stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shoot a deer just above it before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">camped at the place where we first saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islinois."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The savages are on that bank and can</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow it easily," sneered Basile. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">would only be running into them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, it is our only chance," declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick. "Ahead the river makes a turn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right and then almost doubles back</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon itself. It is at the upper end of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">big bend that they will hope to be in ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us at daylight. They will not believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we would turn off and let them get</seg><seg type="columnLine">between us and Lac Mecheygan. If we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry now and go up this small stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they come to it we can leave them</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind and without a trace of the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have taken and without a suspicion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we are not ahead. From the head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of this stream we can surely reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">some place of safety to the north."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Monsieur Dick is right!" agreed Michel</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiastically. "The canoe leaves no</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace. We can turn up this stream for</seg><seg type="columnLine">many leagues and who knows but that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">may cross over to the Rocky River that</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes down from near the land of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Puans, or Ouinibegous. A Mascouten once</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me that the Rocky River flowed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the border of the Islinois country and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last entered the Misisepe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is our only chance," said Leon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come! Let us be on the way to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream before they reach it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how do we know we will reach this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocky River?" objected Basile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even if we don't, it is better than let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting these devils burn us at the stake, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will before another night if we are not on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way," retorted Michel. "Monsieur Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">is right. It is the only thing we can do."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again the canoe was shot swiftly up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream and in a few minutes Dick signaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bow that they were opposite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of the river flowing in from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north. For a moment they listened intently</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there was no sign of life on either shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Paddle," whispered Michel. "It's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, but one we should be glad to take."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silently, cautiously, each man's nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">taut, the canoe was driven close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north bank. Alone on the water, it could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen easily from the shore. Yet there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no savage yells, no arrows dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are in time," whispered Leon. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have headed them. Come! Up this stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they do suspect us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The canoe stole into the shadows of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees bordering the smaller river as if into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tunnel and the silent paddles shot it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the darkness. For an hour they</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, the tension growing less until,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they came to a wide, open marsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which the stream twisted in a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of bends and ox-bows, there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer fear of immediate pursuit. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of the men even hoped for safety there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so long as the night lasted they con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued to paddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first signs of dawn found them five</seg><seg type="columnLine">or six leagues from the Islinois River and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the big marsh. The banks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher, trees had come again, although the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream was narrower and twisted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned until they would have lost all sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of direction had it not been for the stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's our salvation," whispered Leon</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitedly as the stream suddenly widened</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a little valley and in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pond, which was about an eighth of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">league across, they could see the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of a small island. "We'll crawl</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the brush on that isle, hide the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sleep until night. If they should come</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way after us they'd never find us</seg><seg type="columnLine">there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a ready acceptance of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposal as all were near exhaustion. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore daylight they and their canoe were</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely hidden and, each taking his turn as</seg><seg type="columnLine">look-out, they slept until nightfall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AGAIN the hours of darkness were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent in putting more leagues be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them and the Islinois River,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not long after midnight they found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream had grown so small that further</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress by canoe was impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we are trapped!" exclaimed Basile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We can't go on without leaving footprints</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bank, even could we hide the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that they would not find it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is still the good chance that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">never suspected our coming this way,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">objected Dick. "If we land now we need</seg><seg type="columnLine">only strike straight north until we come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Rocky River of which Michel has</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard. If we are pursued there is still the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility of our getting to the Rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">River first. When we reach that and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land of the Puans we will be safe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To be sure," agreed Michel. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only course open to us. Dick and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will carry the canoe and you two the mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kets. We can change each league."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And perhaps carry it a dozen leagues,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled Basile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd carry it a thousand rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">have those devils on my back," declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leon. "It is the only way out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty, so let's be at it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were in a country of which white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men knew nothing, far off any possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">water route, and they were not even cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that the Rocky River existed or that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it did, they could reach it by traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">north. Moreover, none of the men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">eaten since the night of their flight and, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as there was danger of pursuit, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not risk the time for, or the noise of,</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting game. They had fled with only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one canoe, their muskets and powder-horns</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ball pouches, from which they were never</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated when among strange savages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eoureurs de bois were accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">famine as well as to feasting, however, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick would have been the last to complain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the weakness of hunger. The fear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vengeance of the ravished Islinois was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them, and all knew the fate that</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited should they be overtaken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly as they struck off across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level prairie in the light of the st*rs they</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot their burdens in the desire for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown river. Each hour they walked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">league, and each hour the bearers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe exchanged their burden for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely less heavy or awkward and irk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some muskets and powder-horns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The agreement they had made for carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the canoe kept Dick and Michel to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, but the heavy work left little op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity for discussion, even had Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that it would be possible to gain Mi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chel's support in his quarrel. That Basile</seg><seg type="columnLine">was allowing no time to elapse before mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing plans for revenge was easily evident in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manner in which he drew Leon ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they might talk without being heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing, however, the Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginian could do. His only chance for safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in remaining with the eoureurs de bois</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so great was the problem that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronted them he put aside his trouble with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile for future settlement and gave his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> entire attention to searching for signs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the much desired river. x</seg><seg type="columnLine">The country was either flat or rolling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually treeless. Once their hunger was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled when they encountered a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd of buffalo and were compelled to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on without trying a shot. Twice their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes were aroused when the land dipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were forced to skirt a marsh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But each time higher land came to rob</seg><seg type="columnLine">them of their hopes for a river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daylight brought them to a forest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">oaks and under their shelter they continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not another step will I carry that</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast!" cried Leon when his turn came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandon one end of the canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll only exchange that burden for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tortures of purgatory," declared Michel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look at the trail we are leaving. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages could follow it with their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">swathed. Come on! Wood usually means</seg><seg type="columnLine">water in this prairie country. The liver</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be just beyond."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour more brought them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks of a broad stream and without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste of a moment they put it between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and possible pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Noise or no noise," said Michel as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed on the north side, "I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a stag for breakfast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll go with you," said Basile as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up his musket. "Two shots are no</seg><seg type="columnLine">louder than one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick and Leon carried the canoe out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight behind some bushes and lay down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. In less than an hour the hunters re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned with a young buck and the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">news that they had discovered traces of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent camp of Mascouten hunters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It means we are in their country and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Islinois will not dare foHow us much</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther," said Michel. "We can risk the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke of a fire so long as we have chanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise of a shot, and then we'll put a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">more leagues between us and the Islinois."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They ate the meat when it was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than scorched. After the meal, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">left little of the buck, Basile took the hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, inserting his knife in the center, began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cut around and around until he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thong half an inch wide and several yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. Silently he handed one end to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michel and, passing it back and forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the fire, they burned off the hair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once or twice during the operation Basile</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at Dick, a hard smile on his cruel</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">98</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we'll be going," he said when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished. "We should be a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues farther away by night and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the village of the Mascoutens."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All day they paddled toward the north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">east and not once was there evidence that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were followed by the Islinois. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause fear of the savages was still with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, they paddled swiftly and without</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking. Hour after hour they went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on, silent, watchful, always swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even in the silence, and despite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural cause of it, Dick began to feel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of a barrier between him and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other three. The hostility of Basile was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be expected and from it he knew that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when safety was certain, there would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">a decisive struggle. But Michel and Leon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amiable, carefree, light-hearted, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once considered firm friends. That his</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent criticism of their plundering</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods should have lost for him some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their regard he had no doubt, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not expected the complete change in them</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he now felt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the first hurried flight from the Isli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nois and the hours of anxious search for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocky River this enmity had not been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident. Now the more leagues they put</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them and the aroused savages the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more Dick sensed the fact that he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only going deeper and deeper into an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known land but that he was going alone. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered how Basile and Leon had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">on ahead, how he had overheard their</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices in argument when they made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long portage in the night. He recalled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alacrity with which Basile had joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michel in the hunt that morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But night and a camp on the bank of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river came before he found a tangible</seg><seg type="columnLine">basis for his suspicions. Michel wandered</seg><seg type="columnLine">off with his musket as soon as they landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and returned with another buck and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">with news of a still more recent camp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mascouten hunters. Basile's interest was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once aroused and, on one pretext or an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, he drew first Leon and then Michel</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT still nothing was said, noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was done, no mention was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the disaster to their plans on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river of the Islinois. Then, after supper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when each had selected a comfortable place</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the fire, Basile spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Michel! Leon! You will remember</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that on the Chicagon I protested against</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking this Englishman with us. You will</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember that we started from Montreal</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fixed plan of trading among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islinois, and you will remember the hopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had for a most successful venture. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will remember, too, your debts, which must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be paid on your return or there is to be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has happened? This English-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man forced himself upon us, with pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">words enough but with what actions?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll back up those actions with words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the words, in turn, with more action!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted Dick angrily. "As for your</seg><seg type="columnLine">acts, Basile Pombert, there are no words</seg><seg type="columnLine">to express the scorn of an honest man for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And he is the man who bragged that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is an outlaw!" laughed Leon. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who came to the French country to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain freedom, to escape the law. He talks</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a blackrobe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I came for freedom, yes," replied Dick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his anger increased by Leon thus openly</seg><seg type="columnLine">alining himself with Basile. "But I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not call it freedom to gain the opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rob, to cheat, to ravish. I sought free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom, but not a license from Satan himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor did I seek the arts of the imps of hell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An outlaw I am, but a man may flee the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrath of a king and still be honest, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember that he is better than the beasts."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He should have been a Jesuit," laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile. '"He should carry the cross, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest brandy, to the pagan savages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would not that Pere Marquette at Michili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">makinac have rejoiced to hear him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angry as Dick was he was not without</seg><seg type="columnLine">caution, and in this jeering attitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile he recognized a greater danger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had expected. The Frenchman felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was playing a safe hand, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely testing his power, merely whet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting his appetite for the enjoyment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">final victory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick's contempt for the man, his repul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, and his memory, still vivid, of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night on the Islinois, caused him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">minimize the danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Call it the cross or what you will," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">retorted angrily, "had I been told, Basile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you planned doing to those innocent</seg><seg type="columnLine">people you ravished I would have pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented it, even if I had been forced to wring</seg><seg type="columnLine">your serpent's neck to accomplish it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And accomplish it you did, son of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">English dog!" cried Basile, displaying anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time. "As I was telling Leon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Michel, we planned much, we hoped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to the St. Lawrence with the where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">withal for a glorious time. What has pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented it? This English swine forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself upon us and then robbed us of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-earned reward. His talk is pretty, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his actions are those of a spy, as I first said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that night on the Islinois, I tell you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he showed his real self. I saw him talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this girl, the one who left these marks</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my face, and with her father, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told them a false story of our being rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers, brigands, even murderers. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened? This old man warned another</seg><seg type="columnLine">village, and here we are, penniless, fugitives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims of an English spy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You lie, Pombert," interrupted Dick in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low voice. "You lie and you knowyou</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie. But I will say this. Had I known</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you intended, had I known how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent what you did, I would have taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">any risk to defeat you. From the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have shown yourself to be a sneak, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ungrateful cur, a beast in the shape of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, but with no other human attributes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would not try to shame you by reminding</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that, had I not carried you to the canoe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would even now be a shriveled cinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an Islinois stake. I claim no credit for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. It was a selfish act, for I was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">saving you for death at my own hands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Virginian had spoken calmly but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly earnest and as he finished he started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rise. Instantly Basile rolled across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and grasped him about the knees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leon and Michel, springing to their feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw themselves at Dick's shoulders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist. Striking, exerting all his strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">to throw them off, he went down beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and before he had ceased struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long strip of rawhide Basile had cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">held his arms and legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three Frenchmen, panting, wiping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the perspiration from their faces, took seats</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the fire from their captive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now what?" asked Leon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A big canoe and a full one on our re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to the St. Lawrence before Winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">sets in," answered Basile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you can talk like, that without</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandy?" demanded Michel in mock amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be silent, you two with the sheep's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads!" commanded Basile sternly. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are like horses. You can work if well</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">driven, but, turned loose in a field, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much could you plow? I planned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most successful endeavor of our lives. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">meddled, took this English dog along de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite my wishes, and see what has hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. Tell me, both of you, who of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">has the head? Who can plan?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right, Basile," answered Leon</seg><seg type="columnLine">humbly. "We have been wrong.

He rolled over so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might have a view of that part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabine behind him, but the floor was bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nothing hung from the empty walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he was about to roll back to his original</seg><seg type="columnLine">position something sharp pricked him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hitching himself around, he began to feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dry grass on which he had been lying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His hands were bound closely to his sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he could move his numbed fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly--at last they struck a hard sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance. His heart leaped at the first touch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instantly he recognized the object as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flint arrow-head. He clutched it so tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">one keen edge cut the skin between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. The pain brought a smile for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth of the tool was proved. Though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused torture he worked his fingers around</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he could slip the flint into the pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his leggings and then, content, rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to his original position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time he became conscious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voices outside the hut. Basile, greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited, was talking more loudly, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering tones penetrating farther than</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he spoken in his usual coarsened growl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Has not started to trade because he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pects to Winter in the West," Dick over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard. "His voyageurs deserted him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is trying to employ Mascoutens to man</seg><seg type="columnLine">his canoes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did you learn his name?" asked Leon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, but from what the savages say</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no doubt but that he is Antoine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"A licensed trader, eh?" said Michel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And on his last journey!" exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile fiercely. "Next to this Englishman</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is none I hate more. It was three</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IOI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago, in west of the Sault Ste. Marie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the Saulteurs, that he robbed me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a year's profits."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is he the one who told the savages that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were plundering them that he might get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trade for himself?" asked Leon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The same. A sanctimonious wretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">who has the good will of the blackrobes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">talks of laws, boasts that he trades legally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the king's sanction, and speaks of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">land as 'the new Empire of France.' I</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore that some day I would cross his trail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the day has come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there is risk in killing a French-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man," objected Michel. "Savages do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">count."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Risk!" exclaimed Basile. "Have you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, absorbed the faint-heartedness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Englishman? Think, man! Never before</seg><seg type="columnLine">has a white man penetrated to this river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None will come for years afterward, and are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the Mascoutens known to be evil, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceitful? Have not his voyageurs deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and will not that be known? Is he</seg><seg type="columnLine">not camped alone on the river? Does an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian hatchet leave a different mark when</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung by a white man?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What if this licensed trader returns with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth. Do you not think more of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breed will follow? Then what of us who</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry not the sanction of kings? We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be driven out of this land that we have dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered, out of the lands wherein our</seg><seg type="columnLine">profits lay. You sicken me, Michel, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your tremors. But in any event he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine. I am to be avenged."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After that what plan?" asked Leon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have a trading outfit, goods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandy. We will Winter to the north and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Spring we will be on our way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Lawrence with heavy canoes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the Englishman?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He will still pay the price, will still buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">us a canoeload of beaver skins. There is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of Hurons on Lac Mecheygan, driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">far from their homes by the Longhouses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We will take this Englishman to them, tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them he is Dutch, from the Dutch colony at</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Amsterdam, and they will give us</seg><seg type="columnLine">every skin in their village for him, for did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the Dutch, and the English, too, fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nish the Longhouses with muskets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A double haul!" cried Leon en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiastically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and a double revenge for me," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied Basile venemously. "I have a mind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay and see the Hurons play with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Englishman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And when do we-" Michel hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When do we brain this Goddin and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">his outfit?" sneered Basile. "I have a mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn the Englishman over to the Mascou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tens now if his presence among us fills you</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such qualms. Today we go on up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river until we learn where he has his camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then tonight! And we will be rich men</seg><seg type="columnLine">again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Basile hurried away to confer with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chiefs of the village and Michel and Leon</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the hut. They were silent and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not look into the corner where Dick lay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Virginian, who had been bound so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs and arms were becoming numb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Michel," he said, "there was a time when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we might have become fast friends. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked each other then and there should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no cause for hard feelings now, no reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">why you can not grant me one small</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Michel looked at him but did not reply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This rawhide is drying and shrinking,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick continued. "See how it is cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my flesh. Already the feeling is gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do me this one favor, Michel, and loosen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bonds a little."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leave them as they are," advised Leon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And the savages will be cheated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, too," answered Dick. "Another day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my legs and arms will be dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is something in that, Leon," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michel as he took a hesitating step toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoner. "See, the hide has cut into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his flesh. It will do no harm to loosen them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, he will always be in our sight."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He crossed over and knelt beside Dick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The green hide had stiffened and contracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was with difficulty that he untied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knots. As the blood rushed into his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremities Dick writhed and groaned from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excruciating pain. His wrists and legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were swollen and Michel, when he rebound</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, could not refrain from leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thongs as loose as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Faint from the pain but thankful that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not come when he had severed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds himself, Dick lay back with his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wall. In a short time, he knew, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood would be running in all his veins, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbness and swelling would almost dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear, and when the time for his escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">came he would have the use of his arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">102</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DICK'S determination to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grown twofold since he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">overheard Basile's infamous plans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not only his own life but that of this un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspecting Frenchman was at stake and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the repugnance and horror with which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had watched the rape of the Islinois was</seg><seg type="columnLine">redoubled at the thought of Basile's</seg><seg type="columnLine">treachery. Seeking freedom himself when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had left Virginia, he was appalled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this interpretation of it by the depraved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pombert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We Start at once!" cried Basile as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the cabine suddenly. "I have ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained that we go to visit our countryman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that we will return. Word has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">received that Goddin is no more than six</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues up the river. We will start at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">so as to find his camp by dark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the Mascoutens thronging about in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their curiosity over the spectacle of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men carrying another securly bound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went down to their canoe. Dick was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid in the bottom and the Frenchmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddled off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Basile originally had intended to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plans from Dicic by calling Leon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michel outside the cabine to discuss them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he abandoned the idea once they were under</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. The man was exuberant, already</seg><seg type="columnLine">spending the gains of this new crime. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found time, too, to taunt Dick, to describe</seg><seg type="columnLine">in detail what he intended to do when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at the camp of the licensed trader,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Virginian, though he lay quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his eyes closed, resolved that nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stand in the way of his liberty that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might rid the earth of this evil spirit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leon and Michel, wholly lacking in moral</seg><seg type="columnLine">conception rather than instinctively crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inal, failed to respond to Basile's mood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They paddled steadily, their eyes always</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching the banks ahead for the camp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trader. But they went to their work</seg><seg type="columnLine">without enthusiasm, as if it were a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreeable task that must be done and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late in the afternoon they began to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">more slowly, reconnoitering from each bend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming impatient when sunset ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These cursed savages make a league to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own liking," complained Basile. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone eight leagues, not six, and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no sign of him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be quiet," whispered Michel from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow as he threw out his paddle and drew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoe backward and toward the bank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is smoke ahead, around the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silently they stepped ashore, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick in the canoe, and crawled through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush along the bank to see if they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached their destination. While Dick was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still undecided whether he should cut his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds then or later they returned and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately began to discuss their plans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's on the other bank, less than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of a league away," said Basile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Michel, slip through the brush up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore and find a place where you can watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. See if there is any one with him, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">many canoes are there, and how the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies behind his camp. Be back at dark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick was lifted from the canoe and Basile</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hand in the Virginian's collar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged him up the bank and back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush. The two then carried the canoe out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight and sat down to await Michel's re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Basile, now that his revenge was near,</seg><seg type="columnLine">became exuberant. He recounted in de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail the wrongs for which he held Antoine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddin responsible, sneered at the circuitous</seg><seg type="columnLine">traits for which the trader was known, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exultantly described how he would end his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If he is asleep I will waken him before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike, let him see who it is that is avenging</seg><seg type="columnLine">past wrongs," he declared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You lie, Pombert!" exclaimed Dick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are too much of a coward to strike a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man except in the back, and, by Heaven, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">these thongs were off my legs and arms I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove it now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those thongs will stay there until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurons, thinking you are a Dutch friend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Iroquois, bum them off," taunted Ba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sile. "And no more from you or I'll give</seg><seg type="columnLine">you a taste of what the savages can do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I well believe that you are capable of it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied Dick. "I do not doubt but that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Longhouse blood itself that gives you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarthy countenance and that black heart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a cry of rage Basile sprang to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick lay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beware, black heart," the Virginian</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned in a low tone. "Touch me now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my face will appear before you as you swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">your bloody hatchet tonight. Lay a hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on me now and after the stake I'll follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">you wherever you go, and at last to the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">that surely waits for you when the savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch their ravisher."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Frenchman recoiled with a mumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">oath and Dick laughed outright at this re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult of the curse he had placed upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go back and boast some more, Pom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bert," he said. "It amuses me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Basile was strangely quiet until the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn of Michel just at dusk with a report</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the trader was Goddin himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was alone in his camp, with two</seg><seg type="columnLine">large canoes drawn up on the bank and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large cabine in which his goods undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stored. The trader had cooked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper and was smoking his evening pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Michel left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," began Basile eagerly, "to work!</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll take the canoe, cross the river, enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest and come upon him from the rear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He will be asleep soon, and remember that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is I who am to enter his cabine. Tonight</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, tonight we will be rich! No one car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ries a greater outfit out of the St. Lawrence</seg><seg type="columnLine">than this Goddin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What of him while we are about this?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Leon as he nodded toward the brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Dick lay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let him lie until we return," was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">command. "Look after his bonds, Michel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we will be off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Michel bent over Dick, felt of the thongs</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his ankles and those that bound his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms to his sides and reported him secure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a few minutes then," said Basile, "it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be dark and we will go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he spoke Dick worked his fingers into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket and grasped the piece of flint.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a second could be wasted. Time</seg><seg type="columnLine">spelled life both for Goddin and himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not only must he reach the camp before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others but he was under the added disad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of having to cross the river without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE moment he heard the French-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men lift their canoe from the brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was busy with his flint. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult work for his hands were still slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly numbed and he had to bend them at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">painful angle to reach a thong with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flint. He had cut half-way through when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was surprised by the sudden appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Leon and Basile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll make sure of him and tie him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this tree," said the leader as he grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick's collar and heaved him farther into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brush. "We'll do it this way so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only will be here when we return but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">will get a little taste of what is coming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he talked he tied one end of a thong</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Dick's ankles, passed it around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree and then beneath the captive's arm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pits. He turned Dick on his side with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small of his back against the tree and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew the thong tight, hauling the feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders around until Dick feared that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back would be broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we are certain," said the French-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man as he gave the knot a final jerk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later Dick heard them step in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the canoe and in the silence that followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that they had gone. Immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was at work with his flint. But now</seg><seg type="columnLine">his difficulties were increased as his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, in which he held the arrow-head, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wedged between his body and the tree. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, however, still reach a thong around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waist, and to which his wrists were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound, and painfully he began to cut it</seg><seg type="columnLine">through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice before it snapped exhaustion</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced him to stop. But his first success</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought added determination and although</seg><seg type="columnLine">his position caused excruciating pain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the perspiration poured from his face, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued frantically to saw at his bonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half-hour went by and his hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not free though he had cut through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thong in several places. From the plans of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three, and the report of Michel con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerning the location of Goddin's camp, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might even then be too late. It occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to call, to shout as loudly as he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the hope that he might arouse the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trader and thereby put him on his guard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he strained to fill his lungs for the effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bonds about his waist loosened and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands fell away from his sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Exultantly he tugged until both wrists</seg><seg type="columnLine">were free and then, though the effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought torture to cramped muscles, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his right hand above his head and cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thong that held shoulders and heels to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether around the tree. The next instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was sitting up, freeing his legs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick's one plan was to reach Goddin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp in time to warn him. So great was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the urgency he was able to rise despite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain in every muscle, but when he attempt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to walk he wondered vaguely why he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should suffer such torture for the sake of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man he had never seen. But the remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brance of Basile's evil face came to him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he struggled on northward along the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, teeth tightly clenched to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crying out at the agony each step</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he walked the pain became less and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when at last he saw the lighter spot against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark forest across the river and knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was opposite the trader's tent he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to swim the stream. He plunged in at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, waded as far as he could, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck out for the opposite shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bank sloped up gradually from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water to the door of the tent, or cabinc as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the French called it, which was set in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of a small opening in the forest. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment Dick watched and listened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then began to crawl forward on his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stay where you are or I will shoot,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a low voice from the thick brush at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick's first thought was that one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three Frenchmen had seen him and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to run for cover when the even, cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone impressed itself upon him for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Monsieur Goddin," he whispered. "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is and I'll shoot if you move. Lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick saw a figure coming toward him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the brush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Monsieur Goddin," he whispered, "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friend, though you never saw me.

Thank God I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are an Englishman," said Goddin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your story is as strange as your presence.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this country."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For your life, sir, do not speak above a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper," implored Dick.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">pray make no noise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Goddin hesitated a moment and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked backward toward the place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had hidden. Dick crawled after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," said Goddin, who still kept his</seg><seg type="columnLine">musket aimed at Dick, "what is this non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense about three Frenchmen attacking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">countryman?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know a eoureur de bois named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile Pombert?" Dick asked in reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have proven your words," was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick answer in an entirely different tone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I need listen to no more except the details</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of Pombert's villainy.

Now we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan to rid New France of this Pombert and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereby merit the respect of all honest men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The others are only tools of his and will</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand or fall as the battle swings.

"I placed a curse</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Pombert today, not that I believe in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">but because I knew that he would, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sure that I would free myself and warn</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in time. I told him that when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck your sleeping figure with his hatchet</seg><seg type="columnLine">my face would appear before him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is only a roll of blankets for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to murder in the tent," answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman.

Besides, I still feel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">green thong tightening into my flesh."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddin laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have hardly proved your point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">monsieur, but you have the desire, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is yours.

He will see my face when he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to strike."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Goddin handed the Virginian a small ax</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had placed in his nest in the brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">and instantly Dick was worming his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward in the grass. The Frenchman</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked, saw him start, and then nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved in the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did not know an Englishman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood so warm," he mused.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too dark for him to see a figure against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thick foliage behind the camp but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could distinguish a shadow between him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the white tent. It flitted across,</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently, quickly, and he knew Pombert</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick, in the manner he had learned from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indian boys in his youth, had gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tent without the possibility of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen from the thicket behind it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass was long and his movements so silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a snake could not have done it more</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. He slipped in under the flap</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost on top of the bed Antoine Goddin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had arranged for just such an emergency.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind it, piled to the peak, were bales of</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods. Against these Dick leaned, waiting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hatchet ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a faint sound beside the tent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pause, then further movement. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the tent flap began to move back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dick heard the rustle of a body rubbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the canvas. The triangle of black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness lost its clear-cut shape and a dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure arose, one arm lifted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beware, Pombert!" Dick warned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sepulchral tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shriek that seemed to rip open the tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst from the Frenchman's throat. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered back, helpless in his terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, craven," Dick said sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lift your hand to strike. I could not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill a snake that runs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The words had their desired effect. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second cry, now of rage, Basile sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, a knife uplifted. His every move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was silhouetted against the white tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the Virginian's position could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguished only by his voice. Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped to one side and the head of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchet crushed into Pombert's skull.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without a sound the Frenchman collapsed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had hardly touched the ground before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick had gripped his collar and dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he stood there, about to call to Goddin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crashing of brush in the forest behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp told him of the presence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leon!" he cried. "Michel! Come and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the carrion!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crashing only grew louder and Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, Monsieur Goddin," he called in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loud voice. "We live in a safer world."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Frenchman ran swiftly across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Monsieur," he said solemnly as he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body lying at Dick's feet, "I and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest men owe you their thanks. It is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange thing that liberty appears in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">various guises. To Pombert it meant a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to rob, to plunder, to kill, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape punishment. Thank God that same</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom attracts men who think and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">in straight lines, for no finer land ever lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the sun than that in which we are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsieur, and it must be saved for those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who will not abuse it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?" demanded Dick curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, "to speak and think in this manner?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A coureur lie bois, monsieur."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But he?" and Dick touched Pombert's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body with his foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Also a ranger of the forests, and one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">too many who are giving us the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thieves and ravishers, of licentious outlaws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of deiilers of a simple people and a fair land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we are not all thus, as you shall leam</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you stay in this country.

You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardon my curiosity, but an Englishman in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a land where Englishmen have never been,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which they do not even know, and a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your character in company with Basile</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pombert--you can see that the whole is very</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there is nothing strange in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">story," replied Dick, "and I will tell it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. But first let us rid ourselves of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains of Pombert. He was made in</seg><seg type="columnLine">God's image even if wholly devoid ot</seg><seg type="columnLine">his precepts.

Goddin exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">after his hearty laughter had interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tale. "You have the spirit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">French, the Latin lightness of humor. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know that Englishmen could even</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciate satire.

"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have often thought so. It has already</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun. Your own Pilgrims to the Plym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">outh country, the Huguenots from mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">own France who settled in La Floride only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to perish, they are the straws. But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to your trouble with Pombert?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick told of the pillaging of the Islinois,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flight and of Pombert's attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtain revenge and to recoup by giving him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Indians as a prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I feel," said Goddin solemnly, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have twice saved my life, my friend.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was on my way to the country of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islinois, of whom I had heard.

Here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no desire to abuse what seemed nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than a Heaven-granted privilege, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to'wander at will through this won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derfully fertile country, to live in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tranquility of that peace which only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide places know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they traveled on and on, crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one watercourse to another, watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the character of the land change constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">107</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet always remain fair, Dick began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">question as to its extent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No man knows," was Goddin's answer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is my desire to find out some day, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on and on into the west until I come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea. It was this desire that first sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">me into the country around the uppermost</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these great lakes, and according to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations and plans another year or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">should see me on my way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the South Sea, the Gulf of Cali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fornia?" asked Dick eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I often doubt if that is what I will find,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Goddin. "For ten years now I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">traded in the district around Michili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">makinac.

I have listened to eoureurs de</seg><seg type="columnLine">bois who have been in places of which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare not speak when they return to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Lawrence, and I have questioned other</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest rangers, like Nicholas Perrot, Raddi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and Groseilliers, and with Jesuits who</seg><seg type="columnLine">are always seeking new pagan peoples, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all these are men who do speak of the places</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you believe all that you hear you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go mad.

My own</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion, based upon reports from all sources</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arrived at after much weighing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sifting and balancing, is that we are still</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long way from the Gulf of California.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The 'great water,' the Misisepe, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the savages speak, is only a river</seg><seg type="columnLine">I feel certain, but a large river like the St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lawrence and flowing through an immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. Great streams come in from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west and I believe one could travel almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand leagues and still fail to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Eastern ocean, the way to the Indies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The white man hopes for the South Sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pearls and gold. He grasps eagerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at tales of great water and strange people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgetting that the savage is fearful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown lands and prone to believe in</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsters and unnatural things. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">even talked with savages who, I am certain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been on the Misisepe, and within two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years I expect to be there myself. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cost of such an expedition is great, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been saving and after another visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Montreal I will start."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY spoke often of this "great</seg><seg type="columnLine">water" and of what might He</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond it. Dick was continually</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed by the extent of Goddin's travels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knowledge of the various savage nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the districts they claimed as their own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Frenchman was generous with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">information and the young Virginian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding romance in every word, absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to the last detail. He learned, too, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">names and histories of many Frenchmen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eoureurs de bois, men who had traveled far,</seg><seg type="columnLine">endured much, only to fail to receive recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nition from France for all their efforts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a strange thing that sends men</seg><seg type="columnLine">into unknown places," said Goddin one</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. "But since the world began I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine men have done it. They risk</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lives, everything, endure incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardships, and they die only with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction that they were first of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">race in some part of the world. You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soul of an explorer, Monsieur Dick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why do you not join me in this journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have planned. Perhaps we might dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover this 'great water,' learn a little of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land beyond."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The words brought a smile to Dick's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he could not conceal and Goddin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing his mirth, angry, hurt, stared at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pardon me, monsieur," the Virginian</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged contritely. "My sense of humor</seg><seg type="columnLine">is ever ready to give offense. But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is some cause for laughter. I scorned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, even to save my neck from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noose, to find this land for one king. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all my adventures in a quest for</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom, you ask me to help find it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. Sir William Berkeley promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">me honor to serve King Charles, to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his name a land he would never see, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ask me to do the same for still another</seg><seg type="columnLine">who believes that God gave him the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">to persecute honest men. Think you then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there can be no kingless land?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you remember your asking me if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed that this land and the air above it</seg><seg type="columnLine">instil something in the heart of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is unknown in Europe?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddin in answer. "I do believe that, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe that some day this land will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with people of the white race and</seg><seg type="columnLine">io8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that they will rule themselves. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is only a dream, perhaps I brood too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much when alone in the forest, but perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do see the significance of events in Europe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and therg is a basis for my belief in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing power of the people to think for</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves. Yet, despite even reason, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not help but feel that this land you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I have seen can never come under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rule of a tyrant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Many times when I have looked over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broad valleys, have dug my toe into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fertile soil, have traveled so far and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily on the great waterways, I have in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my imagination seen farms and villages</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cities filled with a happy, contented,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prosperous people. I have said this to</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, once to Perrot, and have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'What?' Perrot exclaimed. 'This sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age land another France! A plow in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairies! Ships on these great lakes! An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toine, you are a dreamer! This is a fur</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and will remain so. It is'too far and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides, there are not people enough in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world to fill a corner of it. It's fur we</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek here and all we will ever find, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we should be thankful.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't say so to him but I see the fur</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade as the opening wedge only, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that will serve its purpose and be</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. That is why I am content to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, if by doing so I will add my mite to</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the land known."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you have not answered my ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jections to finding this land in the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a king," protested Dick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was only leading up to it. You saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pombert's idea of liberty. You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit that even a king's is better. To me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a king is only a symbol for the people he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rules, and in time I believe that all kings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they exist at all, will be only symbols</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what holds the people together and gives</seg><seg type="columnLine">them safety and happiness. If I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">this 'great water,' this Misisepe, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it in the name of my king to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">my act legal, but in reality I would know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was taking it in the name of my race,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my nation, the people of whom I am one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that in time it would be theirs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was a new idea for Dick and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">received Goddin's words in an unusually</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtful silence. The older man, sensing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impression he had made, content to</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant only the seeds in Dick's fertile mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed the subject to one lying more near</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their every-day life. It was not, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last discussion on this topic. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again it cropped up in their long talks</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the camp-fire in the evenings. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">always, though Dick said little, the French-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man felt more and more certain that when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time came to do that for which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited he would not go alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Goddin was by no means always serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in Dick's exuberant spirits as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his freedom from accepted beliefs he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a constant source of delight. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized, too, the romantic nature of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginian and recounted many adventures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">described many scenes in strange places,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unfolded a wealth of information con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerning the many savage nations which</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived in the neighborhood of the great lakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In. the early Fall they reached a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">far up the Ouisconsin River where Goddin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had Wintered two years before and where</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaver skins were plentiful and of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptional quality. The four Indians re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to their own country and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men repaired the cabines Goddin had</seg><seg type="columnLine">used before, moved the trade-goods into</seg><seg type="columnLine">one and made the other comfortable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">living-quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Winter was a busy one and, for Dick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed quickly. The savages seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn miraculously that they had come and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flocked to the post. Later when the snows</seg><seg type="columnLine">were deep Goddin and Dick made journeys</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their camps. Always they obtained fur</seg><seg type="columnLine">on these trips and weekly Dick saw the pile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of goods diminish and the bales of pelts</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was well that the two worked at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fur-gathering in the early Winter, for with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approach of Spring came the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">famine season. And with it came a change</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the industry of the savages, the fur trade</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopping as suddenly as if it had been cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off with a knife. Goddin, knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their work in the district was finished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made plans to go down-river as soon as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice would permit, and the fur was baled</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daily the famine grew worse. Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">found one camp wiped out by starvation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunters brought their families and crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the post begging for food. Goddin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though his own supplies were low and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dick were living mostly on what little</seg><seg type="columnLine">game they were able to kill, gave what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could. Even in the face of possible want</seg><seg type="columnLine">for themselves the Frenchman could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">109</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">refrain from giving food to the women and</seg><seg type="columnLine">children who hung about his door, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was severe enough in denouncing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men for not hunting and daily drove them</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in search of game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">H AMONG the Ouinibegous who</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought Goddin's charity was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine-man who had gained suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient prestige in his band to abandon hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and live off the proceeds of his magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">arts. Once Goddin caught him taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">food he had just given to a child and drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off with a club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sickness followed hard on the heels of</seg><seg type="columnLine">famine and there were several deaths. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine-man's services were in demand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as his patients died he became more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more bitter toward the white men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">denouncing them as the cause of his failures</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cure and openly insolent when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountered Goddin alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  One family, the first to arrive at the post,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been particularly troublesome. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">father was too lazy to hunt and upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother fell the work of providing for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three children. Her bravery in the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her difficulties, her refusal to complain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ceaseless efforts she made to snare birds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hares, her self-denial and her affection</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her children, had aroused the sympathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and admiration of Dick and Goddin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was helped more generously than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She never begged until one day when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow had nearly gone and the ice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking in the river. She brought to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin her youngest child. Its wasted little</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was wrapped in a filthy deerskin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when she threw this back the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men recoiled with exclamations of horror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The entire body of the child was covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with large ulcerated sores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you no medicines?" asked Dick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have an ointment for troubles of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin and I'll use it!" exclaimed Goddin</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely. "It is folly to meddle with such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. The Jesuits have aroused much</seg><seg type="columnLine">resentment by preaching against the medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cine-man. It can only lead to trouble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we can't abandon this woman now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She has been brave and she has done</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything possible to keep her family</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive. We can't desert her, Dick. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">give her the ointment to apply."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman went away, her eyes alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressing her thankfulness, and a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later when Goddin found her</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband on the river bank, sprawled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the welcome sun, he chased him into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest with a club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The dog lies there while she eats out</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own heart!" he stormed to Dick as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they sat down to dinner. "It is folly to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, to interfere with them, for they believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the)- are right in all things and secretly</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh at our methods, though they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious enough to have our steel and goods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we will be leaving in a few days now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'm willing to have taken the risk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Frenchman, anxious to start down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river with the first breaking of the ice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had completed his preparations in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">of April. The fur was baled, the canoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been made ready, six Ouinibegous had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been engaged to man them as far as Michili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">makinac and the maize and wild oats which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been saved for the journey were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two days after the Indian woman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been given the ointment the two white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men stood on the bank of the river watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ice grind down stream.

In the same instant that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning cry sprang to Dick's lips a musket</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared and the Frenchman swayed, clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his breast and then fell at full length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALONE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T'XICK JEFFREYS, sickened, nerveless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">*-• stunned by the horror of this unthink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able crime, benumbed by the loss of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, stared across the clearing as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were looking at something unreal, as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still in the grip of a horrible nightmare.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not move, could not, until a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">head appeared from behind a clump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The sight brought instant action and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed into the open, straight toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambush from which Goddin had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughtered. So quick was his rush, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly did rage spur him on, he had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabines before the murderers had gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet to flee. One fired a musket</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly and then dropped it. His back was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly turned before Dick was upon him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Virginian's heavy weapon crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">.down through his skull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second savage, the father of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead child, the one whose musket was</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty and therefore who had actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired the shot which had killed Goddin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodged from tree to tree, but he had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">run twenty yards before a ball struck him</seg><seg type="columnLine">scjuarelv in the middle of the back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Still raging, hysterical, sobbing, his brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a tumult, Dick turned back to the clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Fearful now in the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, hesitating as he was about to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the white face of the man he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown to love, he approached Goddin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body slowly. When only a few paces away</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a slight twitch in one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman's legs and with a glad cry the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginian sprang forward and turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Antoine!" he cried. "Open your eyes!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can not--you must not die!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eagerly he thrust his hand inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddin's shirt. The heart was still beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then through his loneliness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair for his friend and his rage against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savages who had brought this sorrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him another fact impressed itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly he leaped to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over the forest had descended a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">hush. There was no sound except the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional lazy grinding of a laggard ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">cake against the shore. Dick realized for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time that throughout his run</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the river from the Indian village,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he stood at the edge of the clearing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even while the savage's musket roared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Antoine fell, the death wail had been echo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up and down the valley. Now all was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick stood looking up the river. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">village was around a bend but he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively what was transpiring there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The women had ceased their wailing, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in another moment the war-cry would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">its place. The musket shots had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard. The medicine-man and his dupe</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not return. Inside of an hour thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">men would be at his heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Instantly he decided upon the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible course. He stooped over Goddin</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the Frenchman opened his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God!" whispered Dick. "I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry you to the canoe. Tell me if it hurts</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much, but bear as much as you can,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend. The savages will be here in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour and we must be downstream as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick slipped his arms gently beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddin's body and staggered to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A canoe was drawn partly out of the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in this he laid his burden. Imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately he was running back to the cabine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to return with powder-horns, bullet pouches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ax, blankets and several other articles</seg><seg type="columnLine">that first met his eyes. He dumped these</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the bow and ran back for corn, wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">oats, a kettle and whatever else he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay his hands on. With an ax he crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sides of the remaining craft and five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes after he had lifted Goddin their</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe was afloat and turned downstream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For half an hour Dick paddled with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his skill and strength. He wanted to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far away as possible before the pursuit</seg><seg type="columnLine">started because he knew that he must stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon to dress Goddin's wounds. A long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight stretch of water a league below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the post offered the opportunity he desired</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and when he reached the lower end of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned ashore at a point where he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">command his back trail for a long distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he stepped out and examined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded man he felt suddenly numb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly alone in the vast, savage-peopled</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness. That there could be no hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">he recognized instantly, and yet because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bond between them was so strong Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not admit his despair. The bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">had smashed Goddin's right arm above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow and then entered his right lung,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps the left, for it had not passed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other side. In the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe was a pool of blood, and the injured</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's beard was crimson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick cut off the sleeve of the jacket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound up the arm as best he could. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole in the side was more difficult and every</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he moved the body blood gushed out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He completed the task only partly to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction and as he finished Goddin again</seg><seg type="columnLine">regained consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is bad," he whispered as his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">met Dick's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not at all," was the instant reply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing that will keep you on your back</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a few days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew you would say that, Dick, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know what has happened. If I were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montreal with the best surgeon in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">France at hand, I could not live."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course not, if you think that way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, Antoine, before we reach Michili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">makinac you'll be helping me paddle."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Before we reach the river of the Mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coutens you will dig a grave," answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddin calmly.

"That is in a wallet in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket, Dick. Don't forget it when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">bury me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't listen to you!" cried the Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginian as he sprang to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been watching the long stretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of river anxiously and suddenly he grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bow of the canoe and set it afloat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are coming, Antoine," he whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered as he pushed out into the current.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Be brave, for it will be many hours before</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stop again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SEEKING always the swiftest cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent, exerting all his strength in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every stroke, Dick drove the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Hour after hour, without losing a pace</seg><seg type="columnLine">in distance or a moment in time, he kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily on at top speed. The fear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuing Ouinibegous was constantly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but it was never for himself. Always</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was the picture of their remorseless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, the fiendish speed with which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bind Antoine to a tree that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not die before they could add to his agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The afternoon wore on and evening came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The river bent often and sharply and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no long stretches by which he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauge the result of the race. At every</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve he glanced over his shoulder, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness set in without his catching a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of the pursuing craft. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still ahead because he had only to flee, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savages had to guard against his hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night brought excessive weariness</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no cessation of his efforts. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had probably held his own and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not afford to forego the oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to increase his lead. The low</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds, the absence of moon or stars, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hope, for the savages must go slowly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make sure they did not pass him. Yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed the darkness fearfully for he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer see the pale face of Antoine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even as he struggled on to save him life</seg><seg type="columnLine">might pass.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This dread uncertainty finally brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a halt, the first in long hours of paddling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He laid aside his blade and crawled for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Antoine," he whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Dick," was the feeble answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What can I do for you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A drink, please. I am burning up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick dipped the kettle over the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lifted Goddin's head. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped blankets about him and returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the paddle in the stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More hours went by and in the silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and darkness the canoe sped on into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">south. If Dick were weary, if his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shoulders and back ached, he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it. He thought only of what would</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen should the Ouinibegous overtake</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, of how he must outdistance them</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that he could have time to care for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Antoine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the night wore on Goddin became</seg><seg type="columnLine">delirious. He rolled and tossed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the canoe and often Dick was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to stop and thrust him down be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the thwarts. He talked continually,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now of his boyhood in France, of his father</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mother, of Montreal, the river of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outaouas, of Perrot and Raddison and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Groseilliers, of many strange nations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages and of distant places he had seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes he spoke in French, sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the language of the Saulteurs, or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ouinibegous, the Hurons, the Outaouas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even of the Nadouaissioux.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick understood them all, for he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only familiar with the Algonquin</seg><seg type="columnLine">dialects but, to his surprise, he had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Ouinibegous spoke a language</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost the same as that of the Sheraws</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own Virginia, while that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadouaissioux, who lived north of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"great water," as spoken by Goddin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that these widely scattered nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">belonged to the same family.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The delirium added to Dick's fear for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friend since each contortion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman's body reopened his wounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he dared not stop for always there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the greater fear of being overtaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Ouinibegous. Of them and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods he had learned enough during</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Winter among them, and from Goddin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories, to keep him pushing on after every</seg><seg type="columnLine">ounce of strength in his body seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been exhausted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ouinibegous had once been a power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful nation, vain, insolent, deceitful, eaters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their enemies' flesh, wholly untrustworthy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accused of more crimes than any people</seg><seg type="columnLine">except the Longhouses. Now they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduced to a comparative handful since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Islinois had avenged themselves fora</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of treachery that had brought exclama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of horror even from several nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the savages themselves. Embittered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their defeat, their desire for conquest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">torture had been sharpened. And all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this would vent itself upon the helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman should they succeed in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the dawn Dick kept on as he had all</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. He was without a plan, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any alternative. He remembered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddin had told him how, in the Spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">floods, it was possible to paddle across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">portage from the Ouisconsin into the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">which led to Lac Mecheygan. Now his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes depended upon that being true. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could reach this place and get through</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the river of the Mascoutens he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape in time to reach Lac Mecheygan</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Michilimakinac, where there undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly would be Frenchmen and proper care</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick estimated that, with the swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">current, he was making two leagues an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if not a little more, and they had Wintered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about fifty leagues above the portage. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept on paddling throughout the twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tour hours he would come to the carrying-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place at noon. There he could leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ouisconsin and in a short time be in waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">that flowed to Lac Mecheygan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Success in his plan depended entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his ability to gain on the savages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That they would continue the pursuit he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not doubt, not only because he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed their medicine-man and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">but because they would not wish to incur</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hostility of the French and the powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations allied with them. The Ouinibegous</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their weakened condition could not afford</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have news of their treachery reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michilimakinac.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the forenoon hours dragged by</seg><seg type="columnLine">without his being able to learn whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">he were half a league or five leagues in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead. At dawn Goddin's delirium had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased, but the bottom of the canoe was</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with blood, a red stream trickling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down between Dick's knees into the stern.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wounded man's face was deadly white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lay without movement and his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The suspense became unbearable to Dick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even if life remained it might pass at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. At last, in frantic desperation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heedless of consequences, he laid aside his</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle and crawled forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Antoine," he whispered anxiously. "An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toine. Are you awake?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Goddin opened his eyes and looked up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was sleeping, Dick," he whispered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but I am glad you wakened me for I feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that I would have passed away without</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Come!

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a spot Goddin would like, a fair view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of river and shore, and it would give Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opportunity to watch his back-trail for</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly a league. He paddled to it, landed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then with infinite care and at the cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all his strength he lifted Goddin to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass at the foot of the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, Dick," said Antoine when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked up the long stretch of river.

It has brought youth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, Dick, mine own youth back again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I owe you much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes closed, his lips moved silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, and he seemed to be asleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a while he began to speak again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not regretful. I have lived a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, though I have not accomplished all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had wished. I have gone through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ii4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with open eyes, knowing that this life in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wilderness is filled with danger. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has been the sauce for the pudding, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of us who take the risks can not</seg><seg type="columnLine">complain when we are caught.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will be gone soon, Dick. I can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a little way up the river, just across</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other shore. I want you to have my</seg><seg type="columnLine">license to trade, friend. It is the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I can leave. And I will go content</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you will make honest use of it, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will see as I have seen that the fur is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the beginning, that this fair land was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not meant for savages who spend their lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">in killing and torturing, that there is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a day when it will be filled with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know you have the vision, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true heart, and that you will do your share</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the work that is to be done.

That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the sum of life, and I know it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again his eyes closed and he was silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long time. Dick feared the ei.1 had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come and waited in dumb terror. At last</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood-blackened lips moved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going, Dick," he whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good-by, friend.

Good-bv,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young Virginian, tears streaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his face, bent over the hand of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend and kissed it passionately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Antoine! Antoine!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fingers stiffened convulsively in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasp, blood flowed from the wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's lips, and Dick knew that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time he knelt there beside the body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had hoped, refused to believe, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that death had come to this man for whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had never had anything except love and</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect, he was as stunned as though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ouinibegous' bullet had brought instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblivion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Humbly, reverently, he stretched the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">body out beneath the tree, folded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands across the chest and stood looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the calm, peaceful face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is when we die that we have the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">test of bravery," he said aloud. "Life but</seg><seg type="columnLine">trains us for it. Here died a man with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart like those of the knights of old."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stillness of the bright, sunny Spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon wp suddenly rent by a chorus of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whoops Vnd shrill yells. Dick wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the river to see three canoes, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">manned by a half-dozen savages, less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a league away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VISION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH his heart empty, in the deefl*</seg><seg type="columnLine">black despondency of youth, Dick's</seg><seg type="columnLine">first thought was to remain where he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand above the body of his friend and</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenge him before he himself at last fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside it. He need not wait long. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes all would be over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a remembrance of savage methods</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which he had heard quickened him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">action. It would be sacrilege to leave what</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained of his friend to be the plaything of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their inhuman passions, to permit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, brave face to be mutilated even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. He stooped, grasped the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the waist and staggered down to tire</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe with it. He dropped it on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-soaked blankets, for every second</seg><seg type="columnLine">was precious, and shoved off. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">strokes took him around the bend but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of hearing of the yells of rage that</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoed up and down the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As grimly as twenty-four hours before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick settled to his task. With a lead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than half a league not a stroke must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed. His own canoe was fast, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddin had ordered made according to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own design, but it was heavily loaded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven by only one paddle. The pursuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes were larger, slower, but propelled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen blades each, and the swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">current would play no favorites.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The one factor in Dick's favor, the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">which probably had given him the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">uninterrupted moments with Antoine, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that the Ouinibegous would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">delayed by the fear that he would hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind some island or turn up a forest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden tributary. Around one of the quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">bends it would be easy for him to go ashore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ii5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hide himself and the canoe, and watch them</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this would only serve to put his ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies between him and ultimate safety,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while there was always the danger that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp eye would catch a glimpse of sign on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wet shore. For the present at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">his best course lay in keeping as far ahead as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible and he drove on, always in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftest part of the current, never overlook-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing any position that would add to his speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was weary, sore, losing strength, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a true racer, he ascribed greater weari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and debility to his adversaries, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">his will spurred muscles that shrieked their</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony but submitted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour went by. The river twisted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and not once did Dick catch sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savages. Mid-af ternoon came and for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time he thought of the portage into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river of the Mascoutens, the only route to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lac Mecheygan and a land in which he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find white men. He began to watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks but nothing was familiar. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come up with Goddin when the water was</seg><seg type="columnLine">low at the end of a dry Summer. Now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ouisconsin was beginning to overflow its</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks and it was not at all like the stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which he had embarked the day before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More perplexing than all else, his general</seg><seg type="columnLine">course was different. Early in the day he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had traveled in a southeasterly direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now the declining sun was to the left of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow. It could mean only that he was trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eling toward the southwest, away from Lac</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mecheygan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick, however, still hoped for the portage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still watched the left bank for signs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying-place, but he dared not stop for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful search. So long as he could lift a</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle he must keep on with the current.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he had missed the portage it was a hazard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the game all forest-rangers must expect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before sunset there was no longer any</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt in his mind that he had passed it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The character of the country had changed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pines had given way to oak, maple, linden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">elms, aspens and, along the shores, willows</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thick hedges. High bluffs now bordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley, which was from one to two</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues wide, and the river three or four</seg><seg type="columnLine">times as big as where he had begun his</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey seemed to wander about the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom lands as if seeking a better channel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flood was not at its height for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandbars which formed the banks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still dry. Dick could see evidences of how</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the river sometimes had taken the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley for its bed. Now it turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted, dashed from the high bluffs on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side to those on the other, only to be turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">again by the great hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The river, too, was now thickly strewn</seg><seg type="columnLine">with islands. Sometimes they were bare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white stretches of sand. Again they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, thin strips of higher ground upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which great trees were growing. Always</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river gnawed at their sides and under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined trees hung far out over the current.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Often the islands stretched for a league or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two in a long line, connected by rows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">willows the tops of which waved in the cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent. Two channels then resulted, each a</seg><seg type="columnLine">river in itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the evening the stream straightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for more than a league and was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratively free of islands. At the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">end Dick laid aside his paddle and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. As the canoe was whirled on by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift current he watched the far end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight stretch. Now, if ever, the pursu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing canoes would be seen. But at last he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung around the bend without a sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the evening chill his muscles had stiff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened in the short rest and when again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up his paddle it was only to torture</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Every muscle, every nerve, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbed brain, cried for rest. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">ached. He was too near exhaustion even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to realize that he was hungry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The canoe swung straight on in the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the swiftest part, sometimes stern first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes broadside to the current. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was traveling without effort and darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come soon. He stretched himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the bottom and instantly was</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick was wakened by the sudden stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping of the canoe and a swirling of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">against its side. Dazed, stiff, his brain as</seg><seg type="columnLine">cramped as his body, he lifted himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked around. The sun was high. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe had come to rest on the end of a sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar opposite the base of a bluff which tow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered nearly four hundred feet above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream and against which the river dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiously, only to be swung out again into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the broad valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the sandbar was dry driftwood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick crawled out and started a fire. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a long stretch of water behind him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far as he could see he was alone. Birds</seg><seg type="columnLine">sang, a fish sometimes flipped above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ii6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">surface, but otherwise there was no move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, no sound of life. He cooked break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast and, his strength and alertness revived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately cursed himself for his folly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">so exposing himself to the pursuing Ouini-</seg><seg type="columnLine">begous. He shoved off and began to pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle as swiftly as the day before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     WHEN nightfall came again Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">mggb began to believe that he was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer followed. The savages had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not suspected his going down the Ouisconsin</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the portage. They were probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking for him there, believing that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had turned aside before he reached it or had</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted to paddle through to the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">that led to Lac Mecheygan. All day he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made his two leagues an hour, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through a country as beautiful as</seg><seg type="columnLine">any he had ever seen, and yet there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been no sign of human habitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He and Goddin had often talked with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ouinibegous during the Winter in an effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn something of the "great water."</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lay to the westward. But no member</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tribe had ever been to it, though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed that it was only a few days' pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle down the Ouisconsin. It was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, they said. On its shores strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce nations dwelt, and beneath its surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">were great monsters that swallowed whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes and all that was in them at a gulp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None of their people had ever dared ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture so far. They would not risk it now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the darkness Dick again abandoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to the current and stretched out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the canoe. When morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">came he found that some miracle had kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off the sandbars all night, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still drifting, now straight west, in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff-bound valley. With his breakfast</seg><seg type="columnLine">came confidence that he need no longer fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit and for the first time he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought to the problem that now confronted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The body beneath the blanket in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bow must be buried. This necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">redoubled his loneliness and his sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss, but it also brought an idea. He set</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoe afloat and began to paddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now with the bluffs towering above him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the right, now swinging at the base of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high cliff on the left, turning from side to</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the broad valley, Dick kept on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current. The river had become a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">noble stream, as beautiful as any he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen. He had gone so far to the south</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the murder of Goddin he found the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves budding, the land green with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vividness of Spring. The little islands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which the channel was dotted, lay like</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge emeralds before him. The towering</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluffs had entirely lost their ruggedness</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath their new cloaks of verdure. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley was a broad prairie studded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumps of oaks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At noon the hills came close to the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">on either side, and then the river swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a bend and straightened out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long expanse which broadened at the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">end beneath a line of high hills. For two</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues the water was unbroken except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few small islands directly in front. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left a long ridge rose nearly four hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above him, and on the right low, oak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered hills gave way to a broad prairie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment the sheer beauty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandeur of the scene held Dick breathless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not even the river that flows into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea at New Amsterdam excels it!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then the significence of what he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">impelled itself and he knew that even then</seg><seg type="columnLine">his speeding canoe was at the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ouisconsin, that he, the first of white men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was looking upon the "great water," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper reaches of the Misisepe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dazed by the magnificence of this won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful confluence of the two waters, Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat motionless, only unconsciously keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoe headed with the current. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of the water swept him on past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands and then the view opened before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the north and south. For leagues in</seg><seg type="columnLine">either direction he could see the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. To the south it was broad, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken, stretching from bluff to bluff. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north it widened, the channel studded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by many islands, washing at the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills on the west and at the edge of a prairie</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the east. Not until its strong, quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping current caught and whirled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to the south did Dick begin to paddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Straight on toward the west he went,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a mountain towered above the water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The current became swifter, not the bub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling, swirling, twisting water he had known</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Ouisconsin, but a silent, powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">drift, a force entirely in accord with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">majesty of such a stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swept down, fighting steadily, at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">catching a huge eddy, Dick finally reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of the mountain on the western</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and beached his canoe. Immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">above him, twenty feet higher than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">water, directly facing the entrance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ouisconsin and commanding a broad sweep</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great river itself, was the bare crown</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a knoll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He set to work at once. With his ax he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a rough spade with which to dig a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallow grave in the rocky soil. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to cut out a thwart in the canoe to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remove the body of Goddin, but he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knoll with it and laid it in the slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">depression. Over it he built up a tomb of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones as high as his shoulders. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hewed from a dry driftwood log a plank in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he burned deeply with the heated</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of his ramrod this inscription:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        ANTOINE GODDIN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        He Served His People</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Antoine!" cried Dick as he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and looked at the result of his work:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you could only know! But you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">know! You must know that you he in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land you sought, beyond the 'great water.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the spell of the emotion which gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him Dick stood for a time beside the tomb</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his friend. In the first moments he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">overpowered by a sense of loneliness. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ouisconsin there had always been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of being overtaken by the Ouinibegous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he seemed to realize for the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was more completely, more utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone than man had ever been before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that moment there was no room for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the glory of his achievement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If there were gladness it was only because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been able to lay the body of his friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the shore of the "great water" that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had desired so in life, that beside it he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">peacefully sleep away the ages and watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps the coming of the people for whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had planned and hoped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Loneliness and grief Dick suffered too, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow it was no longer the former un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reconciled bitterness. In its place had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a quiet, sorrowful acceptance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that he must say good-by to the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">man he had ever really loved and travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone on the "great water," hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues from the nearest of his race, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely surrounded by thousands and thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of savages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GRADUALLY, despite his grief and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his loneliness, the one great thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed itself. He, the first of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white race, had found that for which men</seg><seg type="columnLine">had toiled and hoped through a century.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He, of the colony of Virginia, in one short</seg><seg type="columnLine">year had done what the French had sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do for scores of years. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven to it, had reached the river when</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleeing from certain death at the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages. But nothing could detract from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the indisputable fact that he was there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had found the "great water," that</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him had come the distinction of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked up and down the broad reaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stream, across to the Ouisconsin, up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the towering cliffs and bluffs. Never,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought, had he looked upon a grander</seg><seg type="columnLine">a more imposing, scene. Except that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he was far to the west of Lac Mechey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan, he had no knowledge of the country in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he found himself. What this Misi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sepe was, whence it came, where it finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the sea, he could not even guess.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where he stood it flowed straight south</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending slightly toward the east. But for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all he could tell it might swerve off to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west and the Gulf of California, or to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">east and the coast of the Western ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">south of Virginia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind him was a deep ravine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to offer an opportunity to scale the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluff and see more of the beautiful land</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lay about him, and impulsively he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started toward it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Deep into the heart of the hills he went,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his path darkened by great maples and elms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and oaks. A tiny stream trickled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks and und§r moss, and as the ravine</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowed he was forced back and forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">across it, sometimes straight up its bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he was confronted by cliffs that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose straight up past the tops of the tallest</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. The water had cut and worn them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rough surface was brilliant with</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternate strata of many colors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still following the bed of the stream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick came at last to a pool at the base of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff. From the top the water fell in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad, thin sheet. As he looked up he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his only course lay behind the water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall. A ledge offered slippery footing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he passed back of the cascade, around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the falls and up into a broader</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here he turned to the left up a steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope clothed with oaks and at last, pushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a fringe of brush, came out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling suddenness upon the point of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick could not repress an exclamation</seg><seg type="columnLine">118</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of amazement. Far to the north and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south stretched the great river. Its width</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a measure of the mighty valley of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the center. The glint of the sun from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its surface was only a flash of the bright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of a vast land. The hazy distance en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrouded its coming and going and yet in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vited pleasant journeying into the mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The river itself held a peculiar power in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its vastness, its silent, majestic, incontest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able might. There was no hurry, no tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moil. Calm, dignified, peaceful, it lay there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great artery through which flowed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">life of the world's wonderland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Directly opposite Dick opened the mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Ouisconsin, most beautiful of water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways. As far as he could see in either</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction steep, rounded, heavily-wooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluffs hemmed in the Misisepe on the west.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To the east and north lay a broad, green</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain which, to Dick, could have been in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended by the Maker only for the nurture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a coming race. The whole land, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed dormant, expectant, lying ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What an empire!" cried the Virginian</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud. "Nothing could be more fair than</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. It is as Antoine said, the land for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, happy race of people. If only he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have lived to see it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mention of his friend's name brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a realization of what his friend had longed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, what he had planned and worked for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had been so cruelly denied him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had now been given to one who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even striven for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought brought a sense of humility</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of responsibility. Not when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolted at the rape of the Islinois, not when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had avenged the death of Antoine God-</seg><seg type="columnLine">din, not when he had knelt beside his dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, did Dick Jeffreys emerge from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chrysalis of youth. It remained for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge that he had found a new land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land of which Antoine Goddin had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed, to stiffen the fibers of his soul, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring him face to face with responsibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">and duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time Dick stood there, dizzy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea, failing to grasp anything more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the present. Then Antoine's dying words</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to him, and the thought and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The fur is only the beginning. This fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">land was not meant for savages who spend</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their lives in killing and torturing. I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you will have the vision, that you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">do your share. You will have done your</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty to your fellow-men. No, I will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask a promise. Your king will do as well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it can never be a king's land, but a land</seg><seg type="columnLine">of honest, happy people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not for your sake, Antoine," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud. "Not for the sake of any man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You said once that a king is only a symbol</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you, a symbol of that which holds a</seg><seg type="columnLine">people together. You were right, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. You were honest and brave, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you had the vision. I can do no better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than follow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked forward to the very edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff and there, silhouetted against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">April sky, high above the mighty river, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried in a loud voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the name of the people of England</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through their king, Charles the Second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I claim this land."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned, chose a giant oak several</seg><seg type="columnLine">paces behind him, and began to hew away</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side. When he had a broad, flat sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face he built a fire, heated his ramrod and</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned into the wood the words he had cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the heavens a few minutes before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With some difficulty he counted the days</seg><seg type="columnLine">since Antoine had been shot and thereby</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at the date.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was stem, his eyes steady and bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a new zeal.

Huh--I'll win 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they get within range!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Acting on that idea, McTodd went to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunk in his bedroom and dug out a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Navy revolver. It worked perfectly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cartridges fitted, and that was all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man cared to know just then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the calm before the storm and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely man sensed it as he walked to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda and took a look about. Above,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars shone with tropic boldness. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right, beyond the fronds of a big palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree, the dim firelights of a hut village</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickered. To his left a black mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloped upward to a grim crater silent for</seg><seg type="columnLine">many decades. Ahead, below the cliff on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the bungalow stood, the Pacific</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounded on the reefs and bellowed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundering sea-song, or showed its phos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phorescent breakers on the beach below'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village. Into McTodd's nostrils came</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetish, dampish smells from foliage too</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick for its acreage. Into his strained ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">came no human sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For ten minutes the big tow-headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scotsman in white drill stood like a sentinel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then came the pattering of feet on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravel below the bungalow. The natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming. McTodd stepped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, sat down, picked up a book, and pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to read. He found his heart beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely but his nerves steady as a rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he only looked up again when eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">brownish figures had crowded through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway and the lamplight glittered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steel of their big, cruel knives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a motley delegation of undersized</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-humans. Baleful head-hunter eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stared from under matted mops of black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. Rainbow-colored loin-cloths--blue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">green, yellow, red--flashed fantastically</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ever)' move of queerly-shaped bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thin, bent legs. The leader had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenest cloth of all, the biggest knife, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinnest, crudest face. It was Taafa, sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief and prime-devil, now frankly angry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What for you bang Imbi?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maded, in an outburst of trader's English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because Imbi was fresh," returned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man, equally frank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The word was new to Taafa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fraish?" he snarled. "What fraish?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The devil within McTodd made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">show his disdain for the sub-chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is none of your business," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied, quite evenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The words were not understood but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflection was. Eight hands went to sword-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilts. Seven stayed there, but the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade of Taafa flashed out with a sweep of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his scrawny arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What for you bang Imbi?" he roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Then he stuttered. "You--you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">go away-quick!" He pointed with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sword toward the ocean and continents</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond. "You go--go--go!" he screamed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You go other place quick. You no go-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He flexed his wrist and made the sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">sing through the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So!" returned McTodd, coolly. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">means I'm invited to leave the island. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you leave the bungalow. You savvy?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You go--go--git!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he arose to full height and pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the door. He had stood six months</seg><seg type="columnLine">of insult and now he was through for good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INCREDULITY and amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed for an instant on the scarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the savage and then he let his</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural impulses flow, forgetting the lesson</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bombardment, forgetting everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yah!" he shrieked, brandishing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword and advancing on McTodd fero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciously while the others yelled and prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The temper of the savages was up. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">was McTodd's. The air was electric. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The missionary took a step backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the sharp blade cut the air toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and then he went mad--violent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berserk mad. He crashed a mighty sledge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer fist with all his strength into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taafa's face. The sub-chief went limp</seg><seg type="columnLine">122</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and slumped to the floor while the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming islanders came on with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">knives. McTodd whipped out the pistol.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He fired into the thick of them while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow rocked with the thunder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One came under the weapon, got brushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside by a frantic elbow, and slipped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him, grinning evilly. The white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man whirled and smashed the screaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage through the flimsy wall. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow stood on a rock alongside a ravine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An agile figure dodged up to McTodd</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he turned again. The point of a knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">just touched his ribs. The maddened</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scotsman struck with the pistol-butt in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers and the native dropped silently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clear for an instant, McTodd leveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pistol and pulled the trigger fast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first wild shot missed a figure jumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him. The next did not. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the other three. The place was filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with acrid smoke, spitting flame, shrieking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing fighters and the roar of powder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosions until at last when the white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled trigger only an empty click resulted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With one forearm the panting, sweating</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTodd brushed away the perspiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickling into his eyes and his sight took</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick account of the scene. Only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">brownish figure faced him, a poisonous little</seg><seg type="columnLine">reptile with curved knife in hand, hesitating</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether to attack or run. The blond giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly reversed the pistol in his hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started with the butt to finish the job,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping over dark figures that were either</seg><seg type="columnLine">still or quivering. The last native gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell of terror and vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That means more are coming," panted</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTodd, unsteadily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conqueror looked about the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a wreck. His chairs were splintered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pictures on the wall had crashed down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his desk was overturned, the side-wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the ravine was half-gone, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor brown figures with green and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow and red loin-cloths were huddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">queerly, their knives glinting on the reddish</seg><seg type="columnLine">matting between them. Taafa, the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief, had come to consciousness and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting to rise; but when he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scotsman's gaze upon him he played dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McTodd allowed himself a bitter smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His brain was working fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A hostage!" he murmured, thickly. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaf of bread, a box of cartridges, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thou--until some boat arrives!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white giant strode to Taafa, grabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by the scruff of the neck as he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">a snarling dog, dodged a snapping attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bite, swung him to his legs, rushed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the bedroom, and tied his hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet with a rope. After that the pistol was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reloaded and the missionary sat on the bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get his breath and consider his next move</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Taafa writhed around the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white man's absent-minded glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">roved to the front room where the huddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown figures were lying under the garish</seg><seg type="columnLine">light from a lamp that still burned. As if</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing the sight for the first time McTodd</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffened and gasped, then buried his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">in trembling, remorseful hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I came here to preach peace and</seg><seg type="columnLine">good will!" he sobbed, brokenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reaction had set in. He began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremble. 'Jhe pit of his stomach seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. He felt alone--terribly, frightfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, like a child sweating from a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream and peering into the darkness. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronds of the palms murmured in the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside and he jumped from sheer cat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervousness, then looked out of a window</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the quiet stars, finding no comfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">because blood-guilt was on his conscience</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he and his God had parted company.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shivered as with a chill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then McTodd noted the vicious fa£e</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Taafa leering below him and his fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit returned. Hatred called to hatred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">louder than the call of conscience or soften-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing influences. The snarling little devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to typify all the bitter humiliations</seg><seg type="columnLine">and defeats the white man had suffered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTodd longed to throttle him; but Taafa</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too valuable as a hostage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That brought up the question of</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTodd's immediate future. Should he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide in the brush with Taafa and dodge</seg><seg type="columnLine">from thicket to thicket, a mark for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear while he slept, or should he. face the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole crowd where he was and bargain</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them, beat them, or go down like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His jaw set, McTodd decided to stay to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finish, even though the native who fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already spread the alarm through</seg><seg type="columnLine">village and palm-grove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE fleeing one had come upon old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Makosa squatting in front of his hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chatting with two of his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">freres. The runner burst upon them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">great excitement and haste, neglecting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Seeds of Wrath</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mention that he had taken time to cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself so as to show honorable wounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortal combat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The white man has gone quite mad!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">panted the wide-eyed bearer of tidings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Seven are gone and I alone stood him off</seg><seg type="columnLine">until my wounds drained my strength. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">is quite mad!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old chief's nut-brown face skewered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into many wrinkles and he scratched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazzling white wool of his head while</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribesmen came running to hear the tale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearer's story, embellished with liner detail</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the crowd augmented and ending with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzy of words. When it was all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Makosa arose slowly and counted noses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have heard. What shall be done?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cruel faces snarled monkey-like; savage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking knives were fondled and voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">chattered shrilly in the crowd that swirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the fat-stomached, spindle-shanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">old chieftain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here!" snarled a warrior, stretching out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curved blade. "Are we children, to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">here talking? What are these for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And have another devil-boat throw ruin</seg><seg type="columnLine">into us?" reminded Makosa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crafty old chieftain was thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard. Leaving aside the terrible lesson</seg><seg type="columnLine">given two years before by a big cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a most demoniac battery, Makosa saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big blond white missionary as a State</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem in himself. Seven men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone--seven warriors from a thinned com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munity which already had trouble to ward</seg><seg type="columnLine">off raiders who came annually.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From a high hill on a clear day Makosa</seg><seg type="columnLine">could look across the Pacific's sunlit waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see the faint blue mountain-tops of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chandapan, whose people had never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombarded and--who owned anuoying war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes. To Makosa seven fighters meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">something--and the blond white giant still</seg><seg type="columnLine">had that pistol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the man is mad--mad--mad!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">chattered the runner, still haranguing</seg><seg type="columnLine">public opinion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enough!" roared Makosa. "He is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad! He is come to sanity! Look you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His mind has been the mind of a witless</seg><seg type="columnLine">child and his body the body of a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior. He sang for women and played</seg><seg type="columnLine">with children. He spoke of a Gospel</seg><seg type="columnLine">advising meekness before all enemies, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite demented. But now his brain is</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared. He thinks of women and children</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and meekness no longer. He is come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanity. He is a warrior. I shall see him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thereupon the chieftain did so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scene at the interview was as formal</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a meeting of Mandarins, colorful as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid picture by some splashy impressionist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim as the slumbering old volcano that</seg><seg type="columnLine">towered above the lamplit bungalow. Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kosa, in State regalia, consisting of a sword,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two daggers and a purple-and-yellow sash,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waddled through the bungalow door, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by his choicest warriors, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear-carrying populace massed behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Further inside the room the cold-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTodd faced them stiffly, holding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue-steel pistol ready in his right hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping the bound and mutilated Taafa</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him as an exhibit and a hostage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lamplight gleamed impartially on white</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel and blue steel that seemed to shimmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the electricity in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When workmen had cleared away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddled heap of lost warriors, the grunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Makosa squatted on the matting like some</seg><seg type="columnLine">distorted Buddha come to give judgment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rest of the warriors did likewise and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing it was not war but palaver, McTodd</seg><seg type="columnLine">warily seated himself on the arm of a bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered chair, wondering what was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">next.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In trade-English Makosa opened with</seg><seg type="columnLine">accusations concerning Imbi and seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors. McTodd responded with coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter-accusations, throwing in frank opinions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the whole tribe, starting with Makosa</seg><seg type="columnLine">and working down. Brown forms behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chieftain began to sway restlessly like</seg><seg type="columnLine">long grass in a breeze; but Makosa held</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a commanding hand and the murmuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the chieftain began to talk in</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest, picking words slowly from his small</seg><seg type="columnLine">vocabulary; and as he went along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man's face showed alternate amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, calculation, wariness and relief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a cold proposition to unfold to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">missionary who came to preach a Gospel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gentleness but it brought a glint of hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his eyes for at least it offered a way out--</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it were sincere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You--you mean you want me to join</seg><seg type="columnLine">your warriors?" blurted the dazed white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man after Makosa had finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old chief nodded affirmatively and</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTodd's eyes narrowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It may be treachery and it may be true,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered. "It's worth considering."</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His searching, level glance met Makosa's</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he found it hard to conceal his loathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dirty little fat savage, but he did it</seg><seg type="columnLine">by laughing mirthlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I was a Christian missionary! Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, I've almost gone the whole distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">now--what's the difference?" He nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the chieftain. "All right. I'll take you</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, but I'll be the boss. Understand?</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's going to be discipline!" He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsed into trade-English, pointing a finger:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"White man say you do, you do; you no do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man shoot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Makosa caught the general idea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded grave approval, for the wily old</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftain estimated this six-foot-three white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin to be a most desirable ally. Thus the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palaver was concluded; after which Makosa</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose and blandly started to waddle toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taafa. Thinking fast, the white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to let the sneering little devil go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he stood aside, while the general populace</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to file out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Severing Taafa's cords Makosa started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave also, but his eye caught the gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing crucifix on the table. Half-forgetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTodd, he began to edge toward it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he got in front of the table he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if to look toward Taafa but his left hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">was behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Drop that!" snarled McTodd, jumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him. "Here, you dirty little thief--</seg><seg type="columnLine">let go of that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wrenched the crucifix out of the chief's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand while warriors in the doorway turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood irresolutely.

And he pointed toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old chief grabbed the glittering thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust into his hand and fairly flew out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, knocking aside swordsmen com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to his rescue, who stood uncertainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment before following him for</seg><seg type="columnLine">council. When they had gone clamoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hill the big white man stood alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his battered living-room, his temper</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagging away again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I have fallen even to this sacrilege!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he murmured, bowiqg his head.

"I am no better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than my fellow-savages--as is proper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now that I've started I'll make 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">better warriors, dead or alive!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FILLED with this aggressive reso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lution McTodd strode to the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">next morning, still half expecting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be surrounded and killed but prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything. Dirty brown warriors gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, half-awed and half-hateful looks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but none molested him even though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked into the hut of the chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get your gang together!" ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTodd, pointing to a cleared field. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man seemed like a person possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the demon of energy so old Makosa</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded and ordered his crowd to work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not without first accounting for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crucifix.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we'll have some drilling," an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced McTodd to the spearmen who</seg><seg type="columnLine">straggled out past him. "It's long since</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was in the university cadets but you won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the difference anyhow. Hey, you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn around--go other way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grabbed a warrior and shoved him</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the field briskly. Subconsciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was glorying in his unhallowed leader-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. He had been a pariah here. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was different.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sorting out his wondering savages by</seg><seg type="columnLine">stature, separating swordsmen from spear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, the white giant finally managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">aline his dubious rabble of brown non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">descripts and teach them elemental com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mands in terse English. At first the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave interest and squirmed through easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolutions because it was novel, but within</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour the ranks began to sag and indiffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence took place of obedience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then McTodd commenced to assert his</seg><seg type="columnLine">discipline with calculated audacity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first savage who fell out of line was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuffed and shoved back. The second was</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked and straightened up. The third</seg><seg type="columnLine">was knocked down instantly and scowls</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to meet the white man from every</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, but he did not care now. He meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to overcome them right at the start. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">after two hours of it they started for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the ready pistol-muzzle came forth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fell back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McTodd knew he was arrogant, over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Seeds of Wrath</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">125</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing, even brutal, but the memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those six months of purgatory was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him always. He would either master these</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-humans or go down shooting. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it looked as if he were going down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt like a lion-tamer, able to face these</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild creatures but loath to turn his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Makosa arrived, still clutching that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gilded crucifix. McTodd gave him public</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeisance and led him to the front rank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made him stand there. The queer old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the purple-and-yellow breech-cloth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding that gleaming thing, became the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of all attention. McTodd noted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change and smiled mirthlessly. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">learning. A chieftain holding an emblem</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the front rank means something the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world over. McTodd kept him there for</seg><seg type="columnLine">good and through this miracle the first day</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed and the white giant- had gone far</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward establishing mastery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seven days the implacable Scotsman</seg><seg type="columnLine">drilled the natives with the aid of tongue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist and pistol, and by the eighth they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could swing by him in solid ranks, answer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to his iron discipline. Some had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble but these were knocked to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground relentlessly; and somehow, in place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of black looks, McTodd noted he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting more willing obedience. After that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was easier. He had them under control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a different McTodd now. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a bearded, coatless athlete with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terse manners of a truckman and the bark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing voice of a drill-sergeant. He was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer the gentle churchman; he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to be one again; but at least he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now a master and intended to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">so until a trading-schooner came to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">him away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the ninth day the natives felt impelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to start a weird, rhythmic chant that ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">from rank to rank as they marched until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelled to the full four hundred voices.</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTodd stood the ghoulish noise as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could, then--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop that!" he barked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly the crooning died away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioning eyes turned toward the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and made him embarrassed. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">that noise gave him the creeps it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">policy to stop the natural chanting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">marching men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here!" he yelled after an awkward</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause. "If you must sing, learn music!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">His mind cast about for something, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew little except the tunes of the clergy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right," he shouted, recklessly, "sing</seg><seg type="columnLine">this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           Onward, Christian soldiers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           Marching as to war,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         With the Cross-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sacrilege seemed to stick in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scotch throat but he shrugged his shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was no worse than the rest of this busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness so McTodd finished in a roaring voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed to have defiance in it; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually, little by little, the mass of brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures took it up imitatively as the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man chanted it over and over again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY sang it. when the men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chandapan came in war-canoes one</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, ready to sweep all before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. McTodd's spearmen sang it when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they charged in a solid, disciplined phalanx</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the invaders swarmed to the beach and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white man's pistol spat into them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTodd's swordsmen sang it when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">grappled at close quarters. His bowmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not sing at first because they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleverly concealed by squads in ambush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but later all joined in the chorus while six</seg><seg type="columnLine">big upturned war-canoes floated dolefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the sands; and still later they roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in mad celebration while the white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to sleep in his bungalow and wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how soon a sail would appear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was master and arbiter of the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet he was strangely uncomfortable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for at night his searching Scotch conscience</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked him questions that he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer except by defiance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had come a Christian and a gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He would leave as a hard-hitting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckless, masterful, brutal adventurer, unfit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mingle with Christians because his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christianity was a frail thing that fell away</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a thin coat of shellac when his mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles obeyed a pagan temper. Thus he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoned during the long nights when that</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscience made him squirm to its merciless</seg><seg type="columnLine">lash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the old times he had winced from</seg><seg type="columnLine">humiliation when the sun was up but slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a child when night came. Now by</seg><seg type="columnLine">day he bullied and domineered like a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who did not care, and at night he writhed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the weeks lengthened into months he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found his alternate arrogance and self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abasement worse until the nights became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terror and to keep his mind occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stayed as late as possible around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">126</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">village-fires of his people, holding arbitrary</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspections concerning personal cleanliness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening to their cases at law, giving ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">revocable judgments, doling out medicines</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their ills, and teaching them to chant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sacred songs he knew while he beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">time ironically on a goat-skin drum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And at last a sail appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Relieved and yet more scared because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it brought to a focus the problem of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">future, the white giant, with a lump in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, watched the thing grow from a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">speck on the horizon to a good-sized</seg><seg type="columnLine">auxiliary schooner that cast anchor off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach and lowered a boat. But before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the schooner had come within two miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shore McTodd had shaved, donned</seg><seg type="columnLine">decent clothes, and even composed himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first step toward the inevitable con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fession of his ghastly failure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He managed to pull himself together and</seg><seg type="columnLine">start toward his crisis manfully, but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he returned among his dusky minions on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach he rubbed his eyes at what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw, and trembled as if with palsy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That lissome, white-clad figure alongside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the portly man in the boat, calling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving to him--where had he seen it before?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He passed a hand over his muddled head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pieced the matter out slowly from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood of memories. It had lived as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark-eyed queen in a castle-of-dreams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">among roses and geraniums and shady</seg><seg type="columnLine">nooks and sunlit meadows in some distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainbow-land where gentle beings with fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins held human companionship and rarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked each other down. It did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">belong on this ferocious island. The thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was incongruous--like a white fairy wander-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into hell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McTodd pinched himself to see if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake, but he was, for the radiant vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">in tailor-made garments was stepping off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beached boat and its hand touched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its beautiful, rounded face with the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips smiled into his until the smile changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a look of horrified amazement, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">to infinite pity and tenderness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "John!" she gasped, taking him into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious arms like a protecting mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only one word but its vibrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">compassion thrilled his soul and tied his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue so he could only hold her mutely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if afraid she would vanish into dreams</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "John--the lines on your face!" She</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew away a little, appraising him in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tently. "And the terrible look in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes! Oh, my poor big boy, how you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have suffered!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he saw the tears of pity glisten and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered what to say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some--some others suffered, too!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered, idiotically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She quivered and drew a little further</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and studied him very thoughtfully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making his heart sink by dropping his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shaking her head. A stout American</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman in business clothes--the secre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary of the Board of Foreign Missions--</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped in front of her and grasped Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Todd's listless hand and shook it; but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, too, vanished as he looked into</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTodd's somber face and he turned to the,</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, getting a quiet nod and understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, John," requested the man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently, as he took one of McTodd's arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the girl took the other. "Let us go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your bungalow and talk. Come, John!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a coaxing, part-commanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice that almost tempted the quick-acting</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTodd to show who was master right</seg><seg type="columnLine">there; but it was also a friendly voice, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he allowed himself to be led along like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull child while those beside him exchanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They ate inside the bungalow with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary talking of everything but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island and the work; and gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTodd's ear became used to the speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gentlefolk and his mind became saner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he were starting to shake off the thrall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a terrible nightmare. The secretary</seg><seg type="columnLine">only lost his conversational control once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was after McTodd had stared past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palm trees outdoors to the sinister reef</seg><seg type="columnLine">where surf lashed about in frothing rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a baffled thing eternally hurled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">oy demons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've failed!" rasped McTodd suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing a heavy fist on the table. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">through--I've failed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His defiant eyes met the startled ones of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others and he began to rise as if to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have it out; but the secretary tugged at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve pleadingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us enjoy ourselves now and forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest," urged the elderly man. "Later</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can show us your island and your work</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, perhaps, we may judge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McTodd took the hint and listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently thereafter to the tale of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary's travels while on his tour of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Seeds of Wrath</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">127</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spection; and later, when his hour of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paradise was over, McTodd decided with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sigh to let his guests -see conditions for</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, without his telling them. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">he left them in the bungalow and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">below to summon his people and put them</seg><seg type="columnLine">through their paces so that his visitors could</seg><seg type="columnLine">visualize the thing. Explanations would</seg><seg type="columnLine">then be needless--and useless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LINING up his warriors, McTodd</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave them terse directions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to the bungalow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought his thoughtful, wondering guests</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a little knoll. He did not tell them he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was planning a queer military review, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the astonished visitors have an inkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">until solid ranks of brown warriors, keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">step, marched out of a grove of trees into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a meadow below the hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Subconsciously McTodd found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious as to how his savages would act</seg><seg type="columnLine">under their own leaders. It was his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to stand away from it all and look</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his handiwork and he was quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to admit that his cynical handiwork</seg><seg type="columnLine">was good. He even found himself owning</seg><seg type="columnLine">an apologetic vanity in the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holding weapons rigidly in their right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, swinging their left arms in broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">arcs like Russian grenadiers, the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages that McTodd had terrorized into</seg><seg type="columnLine">discipline were merged into a compact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">businesslike machine that obeyed the Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish commands of its leaders instantly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">First came Makosa, carrying the emblem.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the prime swordsmen swung across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field in four ranks of twenty-odd men</seg><seg type="columnLine">each, keeping perfect alinement. Behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them a hundred spears bobbed and flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sun, flanked on either side by bow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and skirmishers whose left arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed rhythmically as they walked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some one started singing. The others</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it up and soon the chorus rolled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank to rank--the grand old hymn of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christianity, quaintly distorted in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer, savage wording:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On-gwa Clifton so-jass-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McTodd glanced toward the secretary</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his left and saw the man's jaw drooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in petrified amazement. When he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around there was something like admiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his quizzical eyes, but McTodd quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted his glance to the girl at his right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He only saw her straight profile. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring below and on her face was a deeper</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">color than he had ever seen before. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself trembling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you have failed?" came her vibrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, queerly intoned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he murmured, unsteadily. "I--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not come here to train warriors."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps you had to," she replied, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe you builded better than you knew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look!" She pointed a white-clad arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the swinging black column that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was counter-marching. "You came here</seg><seg type="columnLine">to teach these people at least the forms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our religion. Hear them? They are sing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the song of that religion!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned to him and in her eyes he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great admiration and triumph, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had justified all her mighty faith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's--it's splendid!" she cried. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been taught law and order. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are clean and neat. They have learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">discipline. Why--it's perfect! Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross is 'going on before.' Do you see?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And she pointed toward the fat old chief-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain holding the emblem in his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if a binding had been stricken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes McTodd gasped, electrified at</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he saw. He rubbed his eyes, awake</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last. In a flash of vivid understanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized that he had planted the seed he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to plant and opened the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had come to open. He was the plow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He had used dynamite because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil was hard; but now the top crust was</seg><seg type="columnLine">softened and those who came after him</seg><seg type="columnLine">need only be the cultivators. The children</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these savages could be friends to civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion forevermore. McTodd knew at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had not failed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white man's methods had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">harsh and brutal. He had been goaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to things unthinkable in his sane and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christian state. He had killed. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">denied his Creator. But now his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed and tears ran unashamed down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see it all now," he choked.

Five years before, the superintendent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Superior Transit Company had told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that the company had nothing for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but advised him to wait until something</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned up in the line.

Each Spring he made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">application for a berth to the superintend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent, until it had become merely a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of form to him as well as to the superin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime Johnny Rice had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work at something to keep his board paid at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mother Reagan's, so he took a job as floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss in the Hudson Line's warehouses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the hours were long and he earned</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty a month.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny knew the reason as well as any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailor along the water-front and it cut into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sensitive nature to hear them discussing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as "Captain Jinx."

Out past the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fish Point light, she foamed with a howling</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor'easter blowing behind her.

As the Swain neared Keweenaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Point, jutting out for miles into Lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">Superior, with its copper-laden rocks, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper and his chief met at supper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you goin' through the canal?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harvey Goulder.

Fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">three miles ahead and off his port bow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Johnny Rice was astounded to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big steamer wallowing in the seas.

At last in a perfect cataract of foam</seg><seg type="columnLine">she swung her nose into the seas and pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently, fore and aft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR more than an hour she bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled on against the wind and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas until every window in her pilot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house was shattered clean from its sash, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike Murphy, who was at the helm, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">drenched and shivering at the wheel, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and hands bleeding from a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But the Benton was astern again on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">starboard side when the Swain began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeat her contortions in the trough of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea, as Murphy put her about again. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the seas behind her once more, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one on board the Swain breathed a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh of relief, along with a prayer of thanks-</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving, perhaps. At any rate the Swain</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up her headway rapidly and bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">down again upon the disabled Benton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For once things seemed about to turn out</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Captain Johnny Rice figured they</seg><seg type="columnLine">should. Fortunately the progress of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ore-laden Benton toward the rocky shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">line had been slow. The seas had swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her continually but her heavy, bulky</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull, low in the water, resisted the drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a water-soaked log.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As she drifted slowly into shallower water</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the point, she let go her anchors as a last</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope and the rocky bottom furnished a</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch for them. The chains strained and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tugged and clanged with the roll of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, but they held, though the sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas threatened constantly to break the grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the anchors on the bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an audacity which astounded him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">self, Johnny Rice drove the Swain full speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the channel between the Benton and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks. So close was the speeding ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the outlying rocks of the point that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of the breakers sounded in the skipper's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears above the howl of the wind. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swain drove forward as true as a die to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">helm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A grim smile of satisfaction spread over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny Rice's face. He had solved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of mastery of the hoodoo ship, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great idea had worked out successfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under strong headway the Swain would</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle with the accuracy of a racing yacht.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without it she was as helpless as a craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a rudder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just at the right time Carter, stationed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the after cabin, sent the thin black heaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">line twisting through space and as it landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a thud on the wet deck of the Benton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a desperate sailor from that ship sprawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it, emerging from a sea which buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at the same time, with the line clasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly in his hands. Like a madman he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed forward with it and with lightning</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers he made it fast in the bight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stout cable which was waiting there. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper of the Benton appeared to have read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mind of Captain John Rice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several hundred feet of heaving line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spliced together, had spun out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swain as she passed the Benton at express</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. Then she slackened up to save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain which would come when the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable came dripping and twisting through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea like a long, thin snake. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was aboard at last and made fast around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drum of the big windlass in the Swain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern, the big siren roared out a triumphant</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal. The cable straightened out under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strain, and the screw of the Swain</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent the water rumbling away from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On board the Benton, the anchor hoists</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattled and deck engines coughed rapidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly the great folding anchors which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved her were torn from their grip on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks below, and the deep-laden ship began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to slip forward, slowly and uncertainly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first and then more steadily with increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. Her prow swung outward as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swain pulled her away from the rocks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction. As the Benton plunged for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward under the steady pull, a deep blast from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her whistle informed the Swain of her safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a language stronger than the victorious</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts of men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Raven Mocker</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">145</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS a long dreary drag to Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luth, but the gale had blown itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">out when the Swain pulled into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer harbor with the Benton plowing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of a long tow line behind her. A tug</seg><seg type="columnLine">came rolling out to relieve her of her burden</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Swain went on alone up the chan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel, bumping a dock, here and there, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintain her reputation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Johnny Rice stumbled ashore as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as she landed and remained long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to wire a report of the affair to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Felton. Then he went back aboard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled into his bunk, without removing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes. When he awakened twenty hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, the lake country from Buffalo to Port</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Arthur, was ablaze with the press yarns of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his performance, and Carter was nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantic in his effort to keep the marine re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porters from breaking in upon the skipper's</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumbers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Felton's telegram was the first thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch Captain Johnny Rice's eye as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled out of his berth and he tore open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow envelope with a quick yank to see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie had been relieved of his command for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his foolishness. However, a sleepy smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced itself into his countenance as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">read:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Great! You've busted the jinx.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upper Towns had expected an embassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of old and experienced warriors to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the mission in this Autumn of 1738.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'But in the great council held at Echota, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital and peace town, the priests spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day in studying the great talismanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystal and reported it was always the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of the young warrior that floated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top. So he "went to the water" to</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">purify himself by bathing.

It was the proudest moment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life when he addressed that illustrious</seg><seg type="columnLine">assemblage, Mohawk, Onondaga, Seneca,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oneida and Cayuga. No warrior's triumph</seg><seg type="columnLine">could equal his thrill of joy as he produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bag his talk was in and opened it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he made the symbolic fire of dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">elm, the light of which should be a beacon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all tribes, he felt close kinship with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gods. When he stripped the white hickory</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark, that the fire might be moved on it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from place to place and illumine all dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">comers of the league, the approbation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silent warriors stole over him like</seg><seg type="columnLine">incense. With impressive dignity he pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented the wampum, showing one dish and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one spoon, signifying all tribes should eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">together in amity. W'ith great eloquence he</seg><seg type="columnLine">proclaimed his people's desire to bur}' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchet so deep no warrior of either nation</seg><seg type="columnLine">could ever dig it up again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In concluding he had said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blood has been spilled and must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped up clean.

Now that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearing home and bringing momentous</seg><seg type="columnLine">news to the elders each eager stride should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have added to his climax of joy. But as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed on through the blazing glory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Autumnal woods he was dismayed to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vague unrest disturbing his mind. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">War Trail, which his eloquence and bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">had turned into a Path of Peace, began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">oppress him. The red blush of the maples</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested blood. He sought to diagnose</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morbid fancy, and instantly imagi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation began working and hinting at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknowable yet impending evil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such a mental attitude was preposterous,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> reason told him--unless it be the malignant</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of a wizard or witch. That it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the natural reaction from a too long</seg><seg type="columnLine">sustained pitch of thought never entered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations. White men as well as red</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed in witches and demons. The very</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact such notions could enter his head at</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a time was proof positive some</seg><seg type="columnLine">malicious agency was working against him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But wizards and ghosts usually work</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a human medium, and there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day when he completely surrendered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange obsession and left the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">and doubled far back to satisfy himself the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iroquois had not broken the faith by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending warriors after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ordinarily such a fear would be absurd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the talk given and received at Onondaga</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sacred. He was as safe among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Five Nations as in his own home. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil spirits work through unsuspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">channels, and the instinct to guard against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stealthy menace was overwhelming. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">second incredible situation developed when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he discovered he was confused as to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">exact whereabouts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such a ridiculous predicament could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">result from the work of the Little People,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who live in hollow trees and caves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose malice is confined to befuddling</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried warriors. He found the trail at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunset and camped for the night, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">undecided as to which particular demon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Little Folks were allied with. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooded over the enigma a star left its</seg><seg type="columnLine">position and streamed away to the horizon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing it was no star at all, but a Fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panther. What it boded he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Early next morning he was afoot, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm of the never-ending forest pressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him like the walls of a tent. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional chatter of a tree-squirrel only</seg><seg type="columnLine">accented the silence. Once a chipmunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran up to him and he saluted it gravely</seg><seg type="columnLine">and accepted it as a sign of good luck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Chipmunk was friendly to man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was clawed by a bear in a coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cil of the animals because he had dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak a good word for men, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripes are a constant reminder of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">loyalty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far above the forest crown sounded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint dugalu dugalu dugalu of the white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breasted geese migrating south: Big Bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">envied them for their ease and swiftness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight and the wide spaces through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Raven Mocker</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">147</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> they traveled with never a fear of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he followed his trail of yesterday he</seg><seg type="columnLine">marveled at the careless marks his moc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casins had left. Now he was moving like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shadow and often examined the priming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his gun. The lofty sentiments expressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Onondaga seemed to be far back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past. He had his bag of peace talk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">white wampum, but they were powerless</seg><seg type="columnLine">to oust the suspicion that some evil was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalking him. Once a wolf startled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">by crossing the trail. He raised his gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all but fired before recognizing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray streak. He was very glad his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not completely tricked him, for wolves</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the watch-dogs of Kanati, the Lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunter, and it spoils a gun to shoot at one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Midday found his superstitious mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking a new twist; he was loath to</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance, although he had not reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point where he had quit the trail to double</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. The consciousness of danger no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer emanated from the rear, and, seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, there was no logic in his tarrying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He recognized this, but decided some sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an ambush awaited him down the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he waited a bit the ambush would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So again he camped with only half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's journey completed, and that night</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wahuhu, the screech owl, began talking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with feminine persistency shouted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same message over and over without giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him an opportunity to ask any questions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other night-birds, through whom the ghosts</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk, joined in and derided him, but he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover no clue. A priest would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned the truth from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On resuming his journey in the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took a new tack with his mind. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly told himself--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will think of nothing but my Sister,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little Feather, who dances like the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams and sings like the red bird."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so long as he crowded his mind with</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts of Little Feather and her winsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetness he was at peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But concentration has its limits, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself declaring he was not afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any enemy he could see. Nor did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear death. It was the inexplicable that</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed him and weakened his blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wondered if by chance he had eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flesh of a timid animal while among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Iroquois. He knew he would be what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ate. He had seen warriors become slow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and clumsy because they partook of waka,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.ALL these meditations were ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruptly terminated as through an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening in the forest the sun cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vertical spear of light into the trail, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused his gaze to become fierce and</seg><seg type="columnLine">objective. The dazzling light brought out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in strong relief the signs of a trail entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war path from the west. The marks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fresh and it was following the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had made two days back. By doubling</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the north he had unwittingly placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tracker before him. He quickened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace to maintain his advantage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doubtless it was a Shawnee, that tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">being implacable in their hate since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cherokee drove them north of the Ohio</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrested the Kentucky country from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. This evidence of a tangible foe</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned Big Bear into a man-hunter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was the explanation of his un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">willinghess to advance a full day's journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">yesterday. The Fire-Pan ther was this</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealthy assassin. With his mind satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">on these points he shifted his gun to his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and drew his ax. He preferred the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ax, although it came from the stpre-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bridge, the trader, who had debauched</seg><seg type="columnLine">many young braves of the nation with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong rum. Only one fear now remained;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the newcomer would discover where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he left the trail and understand Iris quarry</seg><seg type="columnLine">was behind, not before, him. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next bend in the ancient path brought him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight of the tracker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glided noiselessly forward, ' his ax</seg><seg type="columnLine">upraised, and sharply yelled--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ku! (Now!)"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a snarl the figure straightened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled, and Big Bear was nonplussed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize a Cherokee from the Lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">Towns, who had taken to living' at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man's fort near the Cherokee settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment on Big Pigeon River.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Whistler!" exclaimed Big Bear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm falling to his side.

The Whistler</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very welcome, for his presence proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Fire-Panther was a liar and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wahuhu had nothing but old woman's talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell.

Yet he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">resist jibing--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Whistler has lived with the whites</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long and drank so much of their strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">water his eyes have grown dim, or he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have known a Shawnee would not leave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail a cow could follow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Whistler drew back his lips in a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarl, his eyes glowing. He knew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">kinsmen viewed him with contempt because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his continued association with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whites. But English rum was fiery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had bought many a better man than he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he drew very close Big Bear caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">taint of his breath and stepped back. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">delinquent's presence seemed to poison the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool, clean woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew I was following Yanegwa's trail,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the Whistler, advancing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big Bear laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Were my people troubled about me?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did they send the brave Whistler to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">me? Why was he bending over my tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though following a war trail?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He followed Yanegwa to kill him!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissed the Whistler, striking with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although taken completely off his guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Bear's instinct of self-preservation</seg><seg type="columnLine">asserted itself automatically. The ax he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was replacing in his belt was jerked upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few inches and the knife glanced from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat side of the head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly the two clinched, clutching</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other's right wrists. Much rum and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft living, however, had made the Whistler</seg><seg type="columnLine">flabby, and as they fell to the ground Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bear secured the advantage. Even then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have spared his assailant, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him bereft of his senses; but as he loosened</seg><seg type="columnLine">his grip the knife leaped upward. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost of a slashed wrist Big Bear caught it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and violently forced it downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coughing hideously, and done for, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whistler relaxed. In sorrow and disgust</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Bear stared at the crumpled figure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Far overhead came an eery sound, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">note of a raven "diving," and not at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling the raven's usual cry. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians recognized it as the voice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kalanu Ahyeliski, the Raven Mocker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that terrible wizard or witch that hovers</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the sick and dying to rob them of life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It usually flies through the heavens in fiery</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape and all other witches and demons</seg><seg type="columnLine">scatter at its approach; jealous yet afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. It was no Fire-Panther that Big</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bear had seen, but the Raven Mocker</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying to be in at a death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kalanu Ahyeliski!" gasped the Whistler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring wildly up into the forest tops.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Keep it away!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have no medicine," shivered Big Bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stay with me, or the Mocker will eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart. If you stay it may keep away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you bury me quick it can not get</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have no medicine," repeated Big Bear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting mightily to overcome his impulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to flee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You come from a great peace talk; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be medicine. You have floated in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic crystal; that must be medicine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can not help you," shuddered Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For he knew the Raven Mocker, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible, even then might be standing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side. He expected to behold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whistler's body leap into the air as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">demon seized it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stay!" panted The Whistler. "Bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent me--to kill you. Little-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The death-rattle cut him short.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dazed by the horror of it all Big Bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only remember .that the Raven</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mocker could not violate a grave. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantically scooped out a hollow in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest mold and covered up the dead man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he ran as though pursued by a legion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of demons. Not till far into the night did</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind clear and permit him to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">connectedly. The Whistler's dying words</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lodged fast in his brain and now de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded attention. He reviewed them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found them incredible. Why should Bridge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">autocrat though he was, seek the life of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearer of belts, a man he had scarcely seen?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet how could a man in his death throes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and while the Raven Mocker crouched at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side speak with a forked tongue?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS early evening when Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bear halted at the Big Pigeon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed long at the Great Smoky</seg><seg type="columnLine">range. One peak in particular had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverence, Kuwahi, "the mulberry place."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There, White Bear, chief of all the bears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived near the enchanted lake of Atagahi,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where wounded bears went to bathe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cured of their hurts. The Cherokee</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that beyond their physical structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was little difference between animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">and men. In fact, the bear was part human</seg><seg type="columnLine">as shown by his habit of standing erect</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Raven Mocker</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">149</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In the old days they had worked and lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. Like the Indians the animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">had their tribes and elected chiefs. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had their town houses, where they held</seg><seg type="columnLine">councils. They shared with man the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same destiny in the Twilight Land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Usunhiyi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the lower slopes a ribbon of red was</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling upward, writhing like a gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake, where the women and children</seg><seg type="columnLine">were burning the dead leaves to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuts underneath. Big Bear had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">homesick for such sights ever since traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the North country. No water could</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever taste like the water from the Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pigeon, no nights so mellow arid starry</seg><seg type="columnLine">as those over the Great Smoky. And yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mumbled words of a would-be assassin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had poisoned Big Bear's home-coming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sinister problem was ever worrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He had nothing Bridge could want.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The trader was a friend of officers at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort and gambled and drank with them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaned them money. He had nothing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">common with the Cherokee Nation, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">relations being confined to exchanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor guns and strong rum for dressed deer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins and other articles of barter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big Bear had seen him many times, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily-built man showing the effects of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gross living. But he did- not believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bridge knew him by sight. The trader</seg><seg type="columnLine">seldom visited the Cherokee towns these</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, having reached a plane of affluence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a plantation and trading-house near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fort and transacted his business there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Much of his time was spent in carousing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the officers. No; it could not be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Whistler had said. The Whistler had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost his reason from fear of the Raven</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mocker. He had spoken crazy words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Determined to accept this conclusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Bear resumed his journey, eager to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcomed by Little Feather. As he ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the river path he discerned a tall figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching at a swift pace. Anywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the Ohio and Savannah he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have recognized that loping gait; and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyously called out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Path-Killer! I come, Yanegwa."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Path-Killer fairly skimmed over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail to embrace him, but Big Bear's heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew cold with a premonition of disaster as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sworn friend gripped him by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and spoke never a word of wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" whispered Big Bear, push-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his friend back and seeking to read his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face through the gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I prayed the mighty Adawehi would tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you.

Little Feather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an uncommonly attractive Indian girl, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">appealed to his brutal fancy the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bloodshot gaze beheld her. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">repulsed his brusk advances. But posses-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion had simply meant the taking; so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called in two of his officer cronies to par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipate in the lark, and gave orders to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">henchmen. That the wench should spoil</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sport by escaping and falling or jumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her death was a fault he should always</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold against the whole Cherokee Nation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He declared as much over his glass as he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his friends and discussed the tragedy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The finding of one of his employees dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day following the girl's death turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into a fiend and he swore in horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">oaths the punishment he would mete out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The discovery of the second dead body ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours later suggested that some one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">started a system of accumulative revenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and weakened his ferocity.

Down the trail beyond the cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground a voice was softly chanting. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, the dancing shadows cast by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torches, the fear in his own mind, caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trader to shiver as though cold. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not summon the will power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">order the shutter closed. He had to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and glare out into the darkness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness what was to happen. The chanting</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scarcely audible, no words being dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguishable. Low and monotonous it kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, drawing nearer and nearer. Then two</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague shapes broke through the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into the rim of the torch zone and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambling up the driveway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a shrill laugh of relief the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">intendent informed them:</seg><seg type="columnLine">152</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The officers, sir, merry from drink.

As</seg><seg type="columnLine">they lifted them to the ground and straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened them out under the window Bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a low cry of abject terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The superintendent feebly cried:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dead and not scalped--waistcoats cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ribbons!

But Bridge was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fident no Shawnee would be overtaken on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Great War Trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he remained closely guarded in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, fear and rum his hourly companions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His superintendent obtained a small num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of soldiers to reinforce the plantation</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, and these made merry in the cook-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house or boisterously patrolled the grounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night. The trader sat at the table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes dozing off, more often awake</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clutching the bottle and a pistol, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaking at every sound. The days passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nothing happened. Inquiries made</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Indian women frequenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plantation elicited no news of Yanegwa</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the Path-Killer. Their tribesmen be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved both had been killed, said the women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The superintendent accepted this theory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two had been slain by the same warrior,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or band, that killed The Whistler and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers. The Shawnee had hoped to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion by refraining from scalping their</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims. Probably there were but very</seg><seg type="columnLine">few in the Shawnee band, and they hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hide in the cane and hills and pick off</seg><seg type="columnLine">a victim now and then. Two Mohawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">braves once remained hidden near one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lower Towns for a space of four moons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealthily killed till the nation believed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be the work of witches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Satisfied the Path-Killer was dead the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">superintendent quietly murdered an Indian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">represented it was Little Feather's lover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and collected his fifty pounds. Never had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trader paid out money so willingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was convinced Big Bear was dead, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passing of the Path-Killer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twilight Land rolled a mighty load from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart.

These opportunities came</seg><seg type="columnLine">each day when the trader stepped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front door and whistled for his favorite</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse. The intelligent animal was allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run free, his master's signal always</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing him to the house on the gallop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the one trait in the trader's brutal</seg><seg type="columnLine">make-up that savored of humanism; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved the horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These were the only occasions when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed himself, and never then except as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was surrounded by his men and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers.

Mackensie was exasperatingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarcastic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Watson was not to be diverted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any such transparent subterfuge as a forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarrel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's it for?" he asked bluntly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mackensie stood up and looked keenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. Decker from behind his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">made some quick signals and mouthed</seg><seg type="columnLine">something with silent distinctness. Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kensie took it all in without shifting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze from Watson's face, and then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled his thin silent smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's for special photographic work,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said evenly; and then he added a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arming postscript. "For details apply to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Reynolds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Watson was staggered;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then it occurred to him instantly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">two such clever spies would surely have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found no difficulty in inventing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">plausible story which would gain them</seg><seg type="columnLine">permission to experiment with the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine. He called them spies openly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his own mind now, and half he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impelled to go to his superior officer with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his suspicions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he had not quite enough evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, he reflected. Give them a little more</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and they would presently weave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope long enough to hang themselves with,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said to himself. So he pretended a</seg><seg type="columnLine">casual interest and presently got away to</seg><seg type="columnLine">consult with his friend Britten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mackensie looked after him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowed eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That young fool is going to give us</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble, Heinie," he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too slow," said Heinie phlegmatically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Already this afternoon we can do it; look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the clouds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mackensie nodded.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not till everything w^s ready for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">start that by a sheer stroke of luck he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mackensie furtively hand a few packages</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to Decker already in the observer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat, neat fat packages of oiled paper about</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten inches long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly it came to him that it was now!</seg><seg type="columnLine">That whatever these two contemplated</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to be done right away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maps," he gasped to himself.

Watson was left</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shrieking and running wildly after it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But only for a second. Swift presence of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mind is one of the first requirements of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fighting pilot, and Uncle Sam's boys have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">always passed through more severe tests</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than any of the allied flyers. In another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">second Watson was racing for his own fast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scout which bore the deadly Vickers gun</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pointing grimly over its nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As Mackensie circled to the higher levels</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he saw him climbing in while there was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rush of mechanicians to the propeller. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">face grew hard with annoyance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "-young fool! He'll be shooting at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us next," he growled. Then with a shrug</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of unconcern: "Well, I'll hide in the cloud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bank. And if he can follow me there he'll</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be some flyer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He certainly would. Flying through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clouds is one of the deadliest trials which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">• an aviator has to face; infinitely worse than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flying by night. But Mackensie set his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">planes in a long slant for the dark bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Just before he cleaved into it he looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down away to his left once more. Watson's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">machine was just rising from the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mackensie smiled his thin smile. In an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other second he was enveloped in heavy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swirling vapor which muffled even the roar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the engine. He brought his machine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the horizontal and settled down with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alert determination to a long drawn-out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">game of moist blind man's buff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently Decker stood up in the front</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seat and turned 'round and waved his hands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in some sort of signal. Then with cool</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">daring he climbed out and stepped on to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the footway of the lower plane as non-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chalantly as though he had been going</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about some small job with the machine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">safe and solid in the hangar instead of five</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet up in the wet, clammy air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He cupped his hands and roared into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mackensie's ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Just I have thought. What if they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">notice the paint is wet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mackensie thought for a second, then:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"They won't. Nobody's likely to stoop</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and look under the plane when we're once</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the ground."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Decker nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yeah, that's right too. Well, I go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ahead with the job."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND with no more fuss than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he proceeded with his usual slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberation to do an unbelievable</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. He dived an arm into the recesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the front seat and produced a tangle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cords and snap-hooks. Then he made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign to Mackensie and moved out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing surface, careful to rest his weight only</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the longitudinal "I" beam and clinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the brace-wires to keep from being</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled from his unstable perch by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred-mile wind which tore at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mackensie watched his balance very</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully and marveled for the thousandth</seg><seg type="columnLine">time at the superhuman sensitiveness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little whizzing gyroscope which detected</seg><seg type="columnLine">every shade of divergence from the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flight. As he found how it automatically</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked up against the increasing leverage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Decker's weight as he made his way out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to the wing he pictured it as a live thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an alert uncanny intelligence of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">own and he thanked its inventor aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Decker was troubled with no flights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of meditative fancy; with unimaginative</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolidity he wound his legs 'round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward center strut and lowered himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a sitting posture. He unraveled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle of rope which resolved itself into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude sort of hammock arrangement. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">methodical exactitude he snapped one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hooks over the base of the strut. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying on his stomach and leaning far over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hurtling abyss, he groped with his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently the other hook snapped com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortingly into an eyebolt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he straightened himself out again</seg><seg type="columnLine">with slow caution and returned as carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had come. From the wonder cabinet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the front seat he now lifted, of all un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely things, a couple of pots of paint and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brush. He leaned over to Mackensie and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held up the spread fingers of one hand three</seg><seg type="columnLine">times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fifteen minutes," he shouted. " 'S all</seg><seg type="columnLine">I need."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fought his way out again and lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself as before. The pots of paint were</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposed of over the edge of the wing, evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently on to hooks below; and then with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cheerful wave of the hand the crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanatic slid over into his swaying, straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">net.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mackensie flew on with a tense face</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the clinging mist and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder. He wondered if he would feel a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lurch if his partner in this wild venture</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be shaken out of his awful perch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But no lurch came. Decker, working with</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron nerve and sure swiftness painted out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the target-circles with which the Allies</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguish their machines and painted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great black cross of the Germans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no hitch, no accident; every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had been thought out and prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in advance. In less than the fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes which he had demanded his round</seg><seg type="columnLine">face appeared over the edge of the wing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he wormed his body up after it like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocky eel. He collected his paraphernalia</seg><seg type="columnLine">and returned as before. Mackensie</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched a hand from the steering-wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slapped him on the back. Decker</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned back at him and proceeded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb over to the other side. Mackensie</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew like a Japanese ladder balancer who</seg><seg type="columnLine">supports a bamboo ladder on his feet while</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slim youth in tights climbs about on it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and does hair-raising stunts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In fifteen more minutes Decker crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from under the other wing. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinning all over like a boy who has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to mischief; but his face grew fierce as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stooped over Mackensie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goot. It is finished," he shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now it is in your hands, the great plan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forwards, and goot luck!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mackensie gripped his hand once, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he drove his machine in a long glide</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the cloud-belt to get his bearings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were far to the south and well over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy's lines. Mackensie nodded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction and climbed again. He pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to travel through the clear upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">strata till he should come again to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hautebois section.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After hurtling for half an hour through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the emptiness--for there could be no air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouting on a day like that--he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize familiar ground through an occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional break in the billowing blanket below</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Then, far away above him his sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes discerned a tiny mosquito of a machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">which immediately dropped down on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a stone. He grinned with appreciation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That'll be friend Watso," he chuckled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he dived into the cloud again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes later his machine came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop behind the neat hangars and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bristling hedge of anti-aircraft guns which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen so often from above. Soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in flat, peakless caps began to run toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Mackensie hopped out and went</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">%</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Honor of the Escadrille</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">163</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet them. He ignored the soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as though they were cattle. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to this: they streamed on past him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before a slender young man who was ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously of another breed Mackensie halted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clicked his heels together and saluted</seg><seg type="columnLine">affectedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Geslatlen Sie," he addressed him in clean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">incisive Hanoverian German. "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leutnant von Mackensen from the Vielle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gard section; I am out of gasoline. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might beg."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aber naturlich, Herr Leutnant," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youthful officer without hesitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All muffled up as Mackensie was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather coat and goggles and helmet, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no discrepancy of uniform for the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be suspicious about. Mackensie's heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been pounding against his chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the encounter began to return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the normal and he heard the officer speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your mechanician will attend to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter. Permit that I escort you %&gt; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters and offer you some refreshment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thank you, no," said Mackensie</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly. "I have not the time to spare;</seg><seg type="columnLine">already I should be back, Excellenz reviews</seg><seg type="columnLine">today personally."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he showed no immediate disposition</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go. Instead, he stood engaging the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man in conversation while he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Decker alight and establish friendly rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions with the soldiers. Decker could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with refreshment if there was any to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, he proclaimed thirstily; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers grinned and winked and led him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hangars. Mackensie conversed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the young officer. He knew from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">accent that he was a Berliner, and to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">any awkward questions about the opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions further down the line he immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">lied glibly, inventing a fascinating story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">having just come back from leave in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">home town of Hanover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The officer was immediately interested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mackensie wondered wildly what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could answer to the eager questions about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cafe Kropke and Weltman's. For half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour he fenced with him, and then, seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Decker in ostentatious evidence beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, he remembered affrightedly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste which was incumbent on him. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deepest reluctance he tore himself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">such pleasant company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he climbed into his seat he whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Decker--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plant all the packages?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Decker nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Camera ready?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, everything. Hurry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Parat?" called Mackensie to the German</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangar crews. "Also--losl"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engine took up Deautifully, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another minute the machine was soaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the hangars in a wide circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    AT THE same instant aviator</seg><seg type="columnLine">fjjflil Watson was pouring his excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">story into Captain Reynolds' ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a story of rage and indignation and loath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; and he clinched his testimony by</seg><seg type="columnLine">asserting, almost weeping with the beastli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of it, that he had finally seen Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kensie's machine dive down through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds into the German lines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Reynolds was deadly serious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's almost inconceivable, what you say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watson," he kept repeating with undis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guised grief. "But if you're so sure, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">since Britten bears you out, I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must take the matter to the general right</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">away. -! What a beastly mess!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Better both come with me, I think."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twenty-five minutes later Mackensie was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping like a plummet into his own lines.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the first time since anybody had known</seg><seg type="columnLine">him he seemed to have lost some of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">phlegmatic calm. He rushed Decker to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Develop out quicker'n all Hades while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hunt up the chief," he barked at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raced for Captain Reynolds' office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes later again he was snatching</seg><seg type="columnLine">a series of three wet prints out of Decker's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and sprinting for the general's head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the general heard his name he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked inquiringly at the three American</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers, who in turn looked amazedly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Qu'on Vadmette, immediatement," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mackensie stalked in and saluted. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">general was brusk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have just obtained some photographs</seg><seg type="columnLine">which may be of immediate importance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">First, this one, from three thousand feet."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The general took it. His tone was terse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This represents the enemy's hangars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have seen it before, it is nothing new."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mackensie handed him another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The same scene, sir, two minutes later."</seg><seg type="columnLine">164</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The general looked at it; and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it again. And the more he looked, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more puzzled he grew. Two of the hangars</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still in plain view; the other three</seg><seg type="columnLine">were obscured in the print by white</seg><seg type="columnLine">smudges, smoky-looking smudges, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">jagged specks apparently bursting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them! Mackensie chose the dramatic mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment for handing in the third.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The same scene again, sir, five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">later on the return circle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The general gasped. Where the five</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheds had been was a chaos of twisted steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tumbled sticks from which rose thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisps of smoke. That was all that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent to the naked eye; magnification</seg><seg type="columnLine">later would develop details, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient. The general gasped some more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then with quick French intuition he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized the awkward situation which this</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing young man's unexpected entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">had created. He was a man of infinite tact;</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was a matter for home settlement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned to Captain Reynolds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Permit me, monsieur," he said with</seg><seg type="columnLine">formal courtesy, "in the name of the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation to acknowledge yet once again an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpayable debt to the Escadrille Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caine.

Nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke. Captain Reynolds did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to handle the wretched situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were half-way across before Watson</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke the uncomfortable silence with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean, manly confession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I've got to apologize to you, Mac,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said--he had the courage to refrain</seg><seg type="columnLine">from falling into the formal Mr. Mackensie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've been thinking some mighty mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">things about you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know it, son," said Mackensie cheer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.

A few casements</seg><seg type="columnLine">were shut; the rest were streaming with</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly colored banners and crowded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heads of women and children.

A tall, spare man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a stained surcoat of soft leather appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside Cospatrick, the provost, and ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledged the citizens' welcome. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Sir Hugh Kennedy, Earl of Carfrae,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the king's justiciar.

His hawk's eyes scanning them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old earl stepped forward, smiling lib</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight-lipped smile, acknowledging their</seg><seg type="columnLine">boisterous applause, and opened his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak. Then, before he could utter a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, Sir Hugh staggered, flung out both</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, and dropped dead at the provost's</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horrified, the crowd stood stunned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent, so that Duncan's cry burst on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own ears with a shock of terror.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows too seemed harmless as before;</seg><seg type="columnLine">excepting those that were safely barred, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own order, they were all too far away</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the dagger to have been thrown from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them by any mortal hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people had found their voices now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some fell to their knees, calling on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saints; some wailed aloud in terror; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-haired beggar in the blue gown of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his caste cried out that the devil had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deed to bring shame on the good town</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Kinlochan. With one accord, the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized on his words, and howled aloud:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Tis the devil's work! 'Tis the devil has</seg><seg type="columnLine">done it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jamieson!

He was a dour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangy Borderer on a stolen horse; though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had little liking for his young officer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he understood the consequences of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">obedience at such a time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You, Kilbeggie," Mclvor ordered, "take</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-score men and search every house</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the town.

He never raided this town, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shared the proceeds of his pillage with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rash young townsmen who smuggled across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the near-by Highland border. Moreover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Kinlochan was loyal to the boy-king</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malcolm with its head, it was loyal to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">defeated Robert with its sentimental heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Evan was a hero to the townsfolk, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was something of a terror to them also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duncan Mclvor knew that he and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">company of spearmen stood in grave danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Evan chose this all too opportune mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment for a dash into the city; the grumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens were almost certain to join hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the outlaw. The king's men were too</seg><seg type="columnLine">few to hold the walls against a numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and determined enemy, with treason menac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them from within. Therefore, detach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing just enough men to hold the city gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and patrol the streets at night, he called</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rest of his command at sunset and</seg><seg type="columnLine">posted them in the keep. This, at least,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could hold, and keep the king's flag</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying, till his messenger could summon</seg><seg type="columnLine">reenforcements from the capital.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing in the red light that streamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in through one of the narrow slits pierced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the stone wall for archers to shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, he examined the fatal dagger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"the devil's dagger," as townsfolk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers called it. Never in his life had</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seen such a weapon. About twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches long, it had a simple cross-hilt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was flush with the sides of the thick blade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blade itself was flat, and instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapering toward the point, it broadened</seg><seg type="columnLine">out like a spearhead, so that it was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy near the point, which was ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">both for piercing and for cutting. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">haft had no pommel, but was blunt, square,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and very rough at the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A bad weapon for a fight," Duncan</seg><seg type="columnLine">mused; "ill-balanced, but apt for throwing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet this was not thrown, at least not by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any mortal man. But that Earl Carfrae</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slain by the devil I will not admit, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are too many in this town who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been glad to do it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Devil's Dagger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He searched the steel for a smith's mark;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at last he found one, or the almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliterated trace of one, near the guard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been nearly filed out, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothed over skilfully. He could barely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">make out the letters "-rg--i."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No Scottish mark that," he commented.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is an outland weapon.

If</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been made in Scotland, I should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid the deed to Evan the Headless, or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his cutthroats."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An iron-studded door opened and a man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">at-arms entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There is a fellow here to speak with you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain," he announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who sends him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cospatrick's daughter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bid him enter," Duncan commanded;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the soldier thrust a cringing servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The fellow stood twirling his leather cap</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hands, plainly frightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?"

Therefore I warn</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, let the provost escape. Ye need not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear for yourself.

A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hacked swords and a little pig's blood will</seg><seg type="columnLine">give color to the tale, and many men will</seg><seg type="columnLine">thank you for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duncan took Gillespie's face in his hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held it close to his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look you," he said, "I have as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard for innocent lives as you have.

At first he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought only of Carmichael's strong, evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and arrogant speech. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something under the man's boldness, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would hardly have been so ready with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his promises to free the provost; nor would</seg><seg type="columnLine">he have dared show his ill-will so openly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And what was the reward he expected from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Margaret?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The man can not be in love with her?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered. "A mere cordwainer!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the thought suited well with Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">michael's insolent behavior; he was a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who would dare much, Duncan felt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shuddered at the idea of this fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">in possession of so lovely and spirited a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl; and suddenly it came over him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a thing would be more terrible to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "St. Andrew!" he cried to himself. "Am</seg><seg type="columnLine">I to fall in love with the daughter of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who may be swinging in a rope this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow?" And after a moment's re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flection: "What if I do?" he asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Whether he be hanged or not, I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">him honest, and his daughter is fair enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">and good enough for any man. And come</seg><seg type="columnLine">what will, I will not let that vile cord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wainer have her!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he knew that the morrow might</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring trouble; the sight of the provost at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gallow's foot might stir the already</seg><seg type="columnLine">restless townsmen to fury. If it came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight, and there were anything in Gillespie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">implied threat that Evan the Headless</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring his outlaws into the battle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Duncan himself would almost certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If Carmichael is one of them--!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, if Carmichael was in Evan's pay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then defeat for the king's troops would</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that Margaret would fall into Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">michael's hands. She was doubtless prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised to the man as a reward of his treason!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She shall know of it, however," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolved; and took inkhorn and parchment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanking his stars for the chance that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been brought up in a monastery. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little later, he dispatched the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter by a trooper:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">To Mistress Margaret Cospatrick:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I,	who have brought your father into peril of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, who may yet be the instrument of his death,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">confess without shame that I love you.

As Duncan</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed a side street, a man stole out of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">house-door, closely muffled. Duncan seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by the arm. The man started vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where does Martin Gillespie live?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duncan questioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Trembling in his grasp, the man pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two turns to the left and at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a close," he answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now, what are you doing out at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this hour?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fellow faltered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back in with you, and do not stir out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side your door again tonight, on pain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death!" snapped Mclvor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other bolted into his house like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit into its burrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he entered into the close to which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">culprit had directed him, Duncan heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door creak on its hinges, and flattened him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self against the high wall which formed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of a tall, rambling house. Watching in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently, he saw a hooded figure steal out softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shut the door behind it. Straining his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, he made out a massive shape between</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and the moonlight, a familiar shape, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only stomach of its size in Kinlochan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Martin Gillespie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But though he had come to question</seg><seg type="columnLine">this very man, the citizen's illegal appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance at midnight changed the course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duncan's intentions. He recognized at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once that if there was any mischief afoot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gillespie's nocturnal sortie was proof not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only of his knowledge of it, but of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicity. Clearly, however much he</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired to avoid bloodshed, he was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">more anxious to free the provost. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was a plot to free the provost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by force if necessary, Duncan no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tiptoeing cautiously toward the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he followed his man's portly figure to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn, down a narrow, winding side street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rear entrance of a large, six-story</seg><seg type="columnLine">house with a high-pitched, many-angled</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof and a wilderness of chimneys. Gil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lespie mounted the steps and looked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehensively. Duncan dropped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cobblestones just in time, and heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchant knock at the door four times in</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid succession. Instantly the door swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, and closed again as soon as Gillespie</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Waiting long enough to avert suspicion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duncan wound his cloak about his face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosened his sword in its scabbard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">judging that the knock was a signal, rapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">four times, as Gillespie had done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened at once; the hall was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark. A hand fell on his, and guided him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a long passage. At last his guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked at an invisible door, and a blaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light burst upon them. Stepping over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the threshold, Duncan found himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an interior room without windows, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventilated only by a small air-shaft. Across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room a fire was burning in a grate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">around which stood or sat a dozen armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Among them, Duncan recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">five of the most prominent and orderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens of Kinlochan; the rest were ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously of the poorer sort, but all resolute-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking fellows. He noticed with dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment that Carmichael was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN HIS excitement, Duncan allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cloak to drop from about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and his polished helmet caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threw back the firelight. Instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion broke loose. Those who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated leaped to their feet; some made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkest comers of the room, others</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed forward toward him, fumbling at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sword-hilts. At once Duncan drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own sword, and prepared for defense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The room echoed with angry shouts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Kill the king's man! Cut him to pieces!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet none seemed anxious to be the first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face his blade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the angle of the chimney, Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gillespie shouldered forward, thrusting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great stomach through the press. With an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort which left him gasping, he hoisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself up on to the top of a massive table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and panting for breath, brought out a shout</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made the conspirators pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Harm him not!" he cried. "It was he</seg><seg type="columnLine">who imprisoned Ronald Cospa trick! Seize</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but wound him not; we will hold him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as hostage for the provost's safety!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was the moment on which Duncan</seg><seg type="columnLine">had counted; when he might, by cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoning and his own promise to say no</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of this meeting to the authorities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissuade the citizens from violence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed rebellion. But before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak, a panel opened in the wall beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chimney; there came the clank of mail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shrill whistle; and a gleaming figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Devil's Dagger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">173</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">strode into the room. Duncan, his sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">still outthrust in defense, stared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newcomer in amazement. He was a tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerfully built man in shining mail, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face completely concealed by the vizor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his helmet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You crack-brained fools!" the armored</seg><seg type="columnLine">man said quietly, but in a voice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">pierced through and silenced the din.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You will have the troops here in a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kill this fellow quietly, and be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, good Evan," Gillespie protested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"would it not be more prudent to hold him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a hostage? If we slay him, the king's</seg><seg type="columnLine">spearmen will butcher us all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The king's troops will have enough to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save their own lives," the outlaw an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. "This lad here is both brain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart to them; put him out of the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his men will offer small resistance to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow. Consider, men of Kinlochan:</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Mclvor escapes, he will bring a charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of high treason against all of you, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will be hey for a short grace and a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope. Now kill him quickly, or I will call my</seg><seg type="columnLine">men off and leave you in the lurch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Believing all his enemies were in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, Duncan had waited calmly until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaw furnished him with all the informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion he wished; but he was speedily un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deceived. A light appeared at the far end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the corridor; the sound of many feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">came toward him; and before he could dash</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the street door, that too swung open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting in two tall fellows in steel caps, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck at him fiercely with long knives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duncan had no room to strike back;</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides, with armored men on both sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him, his position was untenable. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only one way out: forward through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowded room. At least most of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">opponents there were half-trained, peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loving citizens. Swinging his sword, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged straight ahead, striking to right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left with the flat. Unused to desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting, the townsmen made way before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, or fell headlong beneath his blows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the captain stood within striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance of Evan the Headless, with no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">between to save the outlaw from his stroke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duncan raised his sword, felt a weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">thud against the stanch steel rings on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, and realized instantly that he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lowering his point, he dealt Evan a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty blow with his left fist against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">meshed mail covering the throat. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaw fell heavily, still struggling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">release his sword from the scabbard in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it was jammed. Like a flash,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duncan leapt over the prostrate man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the panel, and found himself at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foot of a secret stair, lighted with candles</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck in sconces on the wall. He slammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the panel shut, and dashed up the stair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">extinguishing the candles behind him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran. The stair wound in a spiral, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much as a door opening from it, story</seg><seg type="columnLine">up after story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind him the well roared with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clatter of his pursuers' feet upon the wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">treads. Clad as he was in complete chain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mail, his breath came shorter and shorter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">till he no longer blew out the candles as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he passed them but struck them out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. If there were only a door</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which he might dodge! What if</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way led him into an impasse, a room</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which there was no exit? But trap</seg><seg type="columnLine">or no trap, he must go through it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he shot out through an open</seg><seg type="columnLine">door into a large, meagerly furnished room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slamming the door behind him, Duncan</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted for and found a bolt, and shot it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the first of the pursuers hurled him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self against the other side of the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looking for something to barricade it with,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duncan laid hands on the large table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which a candle was burning, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the room. His eyes fell on a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of parchment beside the candle. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own letter to Margaret Cospatrick!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was more than his own writing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Added to it, like a postscript, were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following lines:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Malcolm Carmichael:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I know by this that you are a traitor. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake of the love you say you have for me, I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not give you over to the soldiers; but I command</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to leave Kinlochan at once and never look upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my face again. If you have had a part in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crime of which my father is falsely accused, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever obtain proof of it, I will denounce you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Margaret Cospatrick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crashing impact of a heavy battle-ax</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other side of the bolted door, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of its edge through the splintering</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel, recalled Duncan to a sense of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">present danger. Hastily placing the parch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment within his helmet, he thrust the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the door leading to the secret stair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Across the room was another door, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">174</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">great iron key in the massive lock. Bound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over to it, he whipped out the key,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the door, sprang through, closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and locked it from the outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking about him, Duncan now found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in a long, narrow attic, lit by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight streaming in through a solitary</seg><seg type="columnLine">dormer window at the far end. Half-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">between him and the window, the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a staircase rose through the dusty floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here was a possible means of escape to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street, and Duncan hastened to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly. But even as he did so, there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rush of feet on the floor below, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">throng of men swept swiftly up the stair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their leader, a tall fellow armed with sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buckler, gave a joyous cry at the sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the captain's figure outlined against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlit window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">i QUICK as thought, Duncan</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 dropped his own sword, and laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of a great iron-bound clothes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest that stood beside him at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the stair. With the strength of</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperation, he heaved it up at arms'</seg><seg type="columnLine">length above his head. At the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge bulk poised, black and threaten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, before him, the leader of the attackers</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched behind his upraised shield, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in vain. Like a stone from a catapult,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monstrous missile came crashing down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushing the life out of two men, transfixing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a third upon the sword of the man behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and sweeping them all into a tangled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking heap at the bottom of the stair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden thunder of blows on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the locked door told Duncan that</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who had pursued him up the secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">stair would soon be through into the attic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the cries and curses of the wounded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could hear more men coming up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower flights of the staircase he had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared; obviously there was no escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him that way, nor could he hope to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stairway against attack from both front</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Running lightly to the far end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attic, Duncan climbed through the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">window out on to the steeply sloping roof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There he took up his position, to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the window and a half-step higher up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof, his left hand resting on the ridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little dormer, his sword upraised and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready. Soon he heard the door of the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">room come crashing down. In an instant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attic seemed full of men, shaking the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">house as they rushed back and forth across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor, overturning chests and boxes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrusting their sword-points into every nook</seg><seg type="columnLine">and comer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, a man wearing a steel cap</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the window and put his head out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still wearing the steep cap, his head rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the slope of the roof, fell over the edge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lodged in a sort of valley between two</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower gables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those within came thronging to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the headless trunk lay by the window in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">widening pool of blood that looked like ink</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the moonlight; but no man offered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">step across it and beneath the terrible blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they knew was waiting outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, Evan the Headless," called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duncan in grim mockery. "What have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to fear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Evan stirred not, nor made reply,</seg><seg type="columnLine">till one of his followers suggested that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them go out another window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the only window from which this</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the roof can be reached," Duncan</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the deep voice of the outlaw say</seg><seg type="columnLine">decisively. "We have the young fool safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapped now. Bar fast the shutter, post</seg><seg type="columnLine">four to watch here and leave the rest to me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">*A solid shutter of heavy boards was</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly placed in the unsashed window</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made fast from within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus left alone on the roof of the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duncan sheathed his sword, climbed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-pitched ridge-pole and looked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, by the bright light of a nearly full</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon. He was trapped indeed, on the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sort of tower that rose fully two stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the rest of the house. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not as much as a chimney-pot for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take cover behind, and at any moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might hear the twang of a bowstring</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a dark corner of the roof below and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel a cloth-yard shaft tear through his shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mail. Listening apprehensively, he sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly heard a voice, the voice of Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gillespie, speak these words, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his very ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Evan had best haste over the wall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride hard, if he is to bring his two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">lances here by tomorrow noon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his astonishment, Duncan nearly fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his death in the street below. Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him, he discovered a low, hooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening in the roof, and realized that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the airshaft ventilating the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground floor where the conspirators</seg><seg type="columnLine">met. But the shaft was far too narrow for</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Devil's Dagger</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">175</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his broad shoulders ever to squeeze through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must find some other means of escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there came to Duncan's ears the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blessed sound of the tramp of disciplined</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, and he knew that one of his own patrols</seg><seg type="columnLine">was passing by. A shout rose to his lips;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he checked it, realizing that to call out</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus from the housetops would almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly rouse the town and start a general</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight that otherwise might be avoided--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for now he knew that the other side would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be ready to strike till tomorrow noon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the loom of St. Andrew's cathedral</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower against the sky, Duncan saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this great rambling house on whose roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sat was much nearer than lie had realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the square; so much so that its front</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all probability faced on it. If he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">but work his way to that end of the roof,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might succeed in attracting the attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the patrol without giving the alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swinging his right leg over the ridgepole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duncan made his way down the moonless</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the roof, cautiously, for the slope was</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep and the old, moss-grown slates were</seg><seg type="columnLine">slippery. Half-way down, he turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to walk as fast as he dared along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope toward the front. He was two-thirds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the way there when, without an instant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning, a cracked slate snapped off and</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke away beneath his tread; his feet flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from under him, he fell heavily on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right side, and shot, feet foremost, down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope and over the edge of the roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "St. Andrew, save me!" he prayed, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell through the dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he struck; not, as he had feared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the pavement but on the lower roof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This also sloped so steeply that his fall was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not broken abruptly; but again turned into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slide. Down he shot with increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity, for now he was in a sort of trough</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two gables, slippery with slime</seg><seg type="columnLine">left there by the rains of many Winters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vainly clutching for any handhold, he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs shoot over the edge of the roof,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his body follow and fall once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight down, this time to certain death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, miraculously, his hands touched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped something hard and round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking up, Duncan saw that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging, at arms' length, from a long water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spout, with its mouth shaped like a dragon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head; just such a gargoyle as then projected</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the eyes of any large dwelling, or may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen grinning from the tower of a Gothic</seg><seg type="columnLine">cathedral today. Thanks to his wearing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chain-mail, his skin was untorn, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">none the worse save for a few bruises.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silently thanking St. Andrew, Duncan</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to pull himself up, to climb on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower roof and there try his fortunes anew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, before he had raised himself an inch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw something that so startled him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he nearly relaxed his hold on the waterspout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Directly in front of him, as he hung, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a dozen feet away, the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house was built out at right angles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through a window in this wing, Duncan</seg><seg type="columnLine">could now look down into a lighted room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, beside a table on which a candle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was burning, loomed the mail-clad bulk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evan the Headless. The outlaw appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be talking with some one who sat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side of the table. All that Duncan</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see of this person was a lean brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, that rested on the table where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">candlelight was brightest. What startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was that this hand was clutching a</seg><seg type="columnLine">duplicate of the devil's dagger!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"WHERE is Duncan Mclvor, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">should command here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Black David, Earl of Ross, sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his horse in the city gate and glowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the unhappy Jamieson. Wriggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the merciless black eyes of the king's</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputy, the embarrassed Borderer stam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered out a tangled tale of midnight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil's daggers and black magic; the gist</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which was that the captain had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared and that the search parties Jamieson</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sent out had failed to find the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fool!" said Black David, contemptu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously.

Contrary to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wont of folk whose town is visited by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">king's deputy, the people had not assembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the square to witness the spectacle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trial. At every house-door, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at every street-corner, men were wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in grim and ominous silence. Not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman or a child was to be seen, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there at a high window, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutters of which were half-closed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">176</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross knew the signs and prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle.

Out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the nearest houses came rushing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">throng of townsmen, who had been waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this moment and signal.

Well, believe me, the most dismal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomy, carc-ridden people I have ever seen in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">not exactly narrow life have been criminals. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">they drink they fight, instead of singing. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">they don't drink they fall into such depths of abys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal misery that even the worst of them would</seg><seg type="columnLine">arouse pity.

The Cherokee firmly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved in the Raven Mocker. Once when Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moony was among the Cherokee he says (page 501,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Myths of the Cherokee") "A sick man was allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die alone because his friends imagined they felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of the Raven Mocker." The same</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority says, "The grewsome belief in The Raven</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mocker is universal among the Cherokee and has</seg><seg type="columnLine">close parallel in other tribes." And he cites as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">example the Iroquois belief in the "cannibal ghost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS THE time of this story is about 1730, or after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Shawneee had been driven to the Ohio, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superstitious fears of the white traders are plausible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The execution of witches in New England was less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than forty years away. In speaking of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">myth of the Cherokee, Mr. Moony says, "The faith</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the existence of the miraculous Littie Deer is</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as strong and universal to-day (1897-98 ed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Myths of the Cherokee") among the older Chero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kee as is the belief in a future life." On commenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the talismanic power attached to the conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crated down of the young antler of the deer the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">author remarks: "So firm was the belief that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence over 'anything about a deer' that eighty or</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred years ago even white traders used to bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain with the Indians for such charms in order to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease their store of deerskins by drawing trade to</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves."

I will try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make this a connected letter, old-timer, but can't say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I shall. I ate a lot of cucumbers yesterday and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a wonder that old stomach of mine reniged. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can generally eat anything that is too thick to drink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or drink anything that is too thin to eat. But this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it failed. I got a "tummy-ache" and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I would cure it by taking a good shot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"hootch." I don't yet know if it was the cucumber</seg><seg type="columnLine">salad or the hootch that put me on the blink, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">naiurally I lay it to the former. Anyway, I hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to be down at a town named Sonsonate</seg><seg type="columnLine">(pretty nearly like Cincinnati, eh?), and was staying</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a hotel. 1 sure passed a hi-yu night of it; griping</seg><seg type="columnLine">with what resembled a cross between a baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the colic and a full-grown hombre with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ptomaine poison. But I dug myself out in time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first train this morning and arrived here on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">job and found out that one of my engineers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen my hand-car last night and had taken a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch to a nearby town and got them all hi-yu</seg><seg type="columnLine">dnink and they had a fight with machetes on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way back and disabled several, and what was worse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke my hand-car. Oh, this life in the tropics is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">M OVV, I'll go back to the start and tell you the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news: I think I told you that after I had vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">unteered for relief work and had done quite a bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, after the earthquake, I felt the pressing need</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a few simoleons. About that time the Red Cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked me to construct their building for them at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own price. 1 told them that I had no money to offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Red Cross work but that if they would buy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">material and pay for the labor I would do the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction for them, donating my work instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. As the officers of the Red Cross knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was broke they mentioned this offer frequently, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got quite a rep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I began to get offers at good prices in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction work. I started in that business and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a partner who had almost as much money as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, but who was a good hustler. I began to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. But I had to work, old top. I worked lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally day and night. Many a night I spent ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king elevations and setting my blue prints for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning sun, and then spent the entire day in man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aging my gangs of men and wondering where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would land the money for the pay-roll that week.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I got the reputation and the business. I en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">close one of my cards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^UHILE I was at this business, the railway whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter-heads I am now using, 'phoned me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked me to come down to see them. I replied that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was too busy. The general manager then came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to see me and wanted me to take charge of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain job for them. I told them that as it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take me out of the city I could not do the work for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--if they could get any one else. They tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then they asked me to at least go down and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work and give them a report on what I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, they to pay any sum that I demanded for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">time so consumed and all expenses for the trip. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed to that if the trip would not occupy more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than three days of my time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND here was the job: When the volcano broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose it opened several new craters. An im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense flow of lava from one of these ran down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered a portion of the railroad about a mile and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half long to a depth of from eighteen to thirty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hot lava. The right-of-way troubles, etc.,' allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to occupy only their old right of way. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">other words, the job was to build a railroad over hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">lava--a stunt never before pulled off in the history</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mankind. Well, I have never seen a job that</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared me. I walked across the lava, over the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed route. I smothered in sulfur fumes, I ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">over white-hot rocks, and sprinted through blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames. I felt the crust give under my feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped for other points which also gave way--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I knew into an infemo of molten rock below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I went back and told them the road could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">put across in three months. They then wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know if I would take the job. I told them I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, on contract, but that I would do it for them if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would pay all expenses and for my superinten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence would pay me a certain sum per week.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They snapped at it. So there you are; I'm the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineer in charge of this work, and am making good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead of getting across in three months, I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it in between six and seven weeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">f)ID you ever see lava? Hot lava, especially?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It does not look like I had supposed. When it</seg><seg type="columnLine">first comes from the crater it appears to be a mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames. At that time it is, of course, in a molten</seg><seg type="columnLine">state. But it partially solidifies rapidly. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure behind breaks up this partially solid rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rolls and tumbles it forward in a rugged mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">which might be likened to a badly plowed field of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some mythological giant. Portions stay boiling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spout out flames and sulfurous smoke, like miniature</seg><seg type="columnLine">volcanoes. Other parts partly cool, but have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">grain like natural rock or granite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T HAVE had my troubles. No one knew any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about such a job. I had to go it blindly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The only way I have succeeded is because I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to work the people. I know their language,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their viewpoint, the arguments that get under their</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin, I know when to be severe with them, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">to treat them in a patriarchal, or better said, a feudal</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner. In other words, I get harmony of action</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the five to six hundred laborers and thirty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty employees I am using. I will succeed. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the troubles have been many. I have run across</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock so hard that it would turn the finest chisels;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was so hot I could not use dynamite. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn up before even the shortest possible fuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">could reach the cap. Using a chisel for fifteen or</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty minutes, it would begin to glow dull red,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose its temper, and double over under the blows like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece of iron just taken from the forge. The rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so hot that the men could stand on it for only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short time per trick. At one time I had gangs</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoveling white-hot stone, their shovels wrapped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue flame, and the bed of lava thundering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracking under their feet. It is a job the like of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which will probably never be seen again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Anyway, I have gotten the line over about half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way already and when the general manager and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">staff came down last Saturday and looked it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">they told me they were more than satisfied and inti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mated if I went ahead the way I was going that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there might be a substantial bonus in it for me at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. I wonder what will happen this time to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">184</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me again? If I ever gel any money and live to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend it, I think the shock will probably kill me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">W/ELL, that is enough of my vicissitudes. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tickled to bear that your honeymoon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed so gloriously, and I hope that the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your lives will be only a continuation of the honey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon. I don't blame you at all for raving a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">over your wife. You have ample reason to do so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If an ornery, sour-dough artist who admits beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get bald-headed can get a wife like that, I wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a good-looking fellow like myself might do?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I can tell you, from experience, friend o' mine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll never meet up with the good times in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts that you enjoy in your own teepee. I often</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish that my life had been laid in different lines, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">--well, there is no use bewailing the mandates of kis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">met. I am doomed, like the wandering Jew, to ktep</seg><seg type="columnLine">always on the move, and suppose I shall eventually</seg><seg type="columnLine">kick in, like a desert rat--with my shoes on (if I own</seg><seg type="columnLine">any) and glorying in the life I've led. even if repent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the death I die.

About trading. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you trade and for what do you trade it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives? Can you give me a list of books or</seg><seg type="columnLine">pamphlets which I could get on the subject?"--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles Gavelda, Clarksburg, W. Va.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Answer, by Mr. Mills:--Works that would be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any practical help on the South Seas are scarce and</seg><seg type="columnLine">expensive, and are published in England. I can not</seg><seg type="columnLine">give you a list of books on the subject available in</seg><seg type="columnLine">U. S. A. Your public libraries might help in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. After the war, if you apply to any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamship lines trading into the South Seas they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will furnish you with guide-books which contain</seg><seg type="columnLine">some information. The censor restricts the issue</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such books, naturally, just now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The amount of money needed to start as a planter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Islands is also one which I can not do justice</seg><seg type="columnLine">to. It is all a matter of personal equation--how</seg><seg type="columnLine">large your ambition may be and the strength of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">banking account. A man with money and enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise and energy--and all are certainly needed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islands--should certainly give the ground a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">look over before he invests. No earthly good taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">my word for it. Who am I that any man should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">leave his home-land and invest his capital for me?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost anything can be raised in the Islands, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">--as you will see by some of the notes I have already</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to the "Ask Adventure" pages--there are so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many groups, and all have their specialty, therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">a definite direction upon your generalizing proposi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is out of the question. If America and Austra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasia, plus Japan and Britain, insist that none of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South-Sea Islands shall go back to Germany, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we shall see great developments in the Islands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cotton, for instance, now almost unknown there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will become a staple product.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the present time the planters merely take off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface what bounteous Nature gives with al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most no effort--copra (the kernel of the coconut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which a valuable soap-making oil is extracted),</seg><seg type="columnLine">bananas (which are shipped to Australia and New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zealand), oranges. Rubber is a developing indus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. In Papua, which the Australians captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Germans, gold has been found, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Australian Government is now prospecting for oil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Islands are on the Equator, therefore hot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The natives generally are friendly toward the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man; and native labor is employed on the planta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. A good, well-kept plantation of any sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">product is a profitable investment, but experience is</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed. If a man owned a small vessel he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade among the Islands, and buy from the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">or planters. The difference between the planter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the trader is that one grows and the other buys</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the outside market.</seg><seg type="columnLine">188</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunting and Fishing in Arizona</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Question:--"I am planning a limited hunting trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the country lying north of Tucson, Arizona.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Being raised east of the Mississippi River am ignor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant of conditions outside of the Arizona cities.

It is grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly in the Malay States and islands adjacent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and India. The nut itself is about the size of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazelnut, though it grows in a membranous cover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as big as a small potato. The people who chew</seg><seg type="columnLine">this stuff cut the nut into pieces, wrap a piece in</seg><seg type="columnLine">lime and the leaf of the betel, and then chew it. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">for tremendous stamina-giving properties, I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know of them. The habit stains lips and mouth a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glaring red color; but preserves the teeth and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts a more or less pleasant odor to the breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps the herb you are thinking of is the coco.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is grown in South and Central Americas, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">iyo</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the coco leaf, chewed, does give wonderful vitality</seg><seg type="columnLine">and staying power. It is, of course, the base of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocaine, and habitual use has almost as evil an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect as the drug itself. In chewing this leaf, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South American native uses ashes or lime with it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the Malay does with his betel. This hastens</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extraction of the juices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only thing I can suggest is that you write to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some big importers, either South American or East</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian, and ask them if they can supply small</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantities. You might get the coco leaves at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good drug-store, but I don't think you'll get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">betel that way. A very good firm to try for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coco is W. R. Grace, Hanover Square, New York.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as these people are simply large merchants, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">conduct no small business, perhaps they would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">bother with a small order. But I think they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least inform you where these herbs can be got. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have personally secured small parcels of coco locally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was before the war, and since that I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable ever to get any. That is the reason I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">not tell you more satisfactorily where you may get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stuff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To wind up perfectly candidly, I don't advise you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to acquire either of these habits. If you propose</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on tremendously fatiguing expeditions in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andes, or in South America generally, you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">find in such places that the guides or natives can</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply you with all the coco you need. Both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things are very well in their place.

The worst effect is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">physiological but psychological.
