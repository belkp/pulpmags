As she turned to fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low him he halted, with his back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanatic, who was still spewing curses, shel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering her, and with a courtly gesture bade</seg><seg type="columnLine">her go on in front. The action and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grace impressed the girl. No one in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">generation, she thought, could have sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vived the incident with the same inimitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignity: it was medieval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the street thronged with donkeys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mules and horses--the jarring note in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape of the party of tourists had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared--the glimpse of the embattled ram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts with the narrow slits in the bastions</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashioned for arrows, made her forget her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own incongruous clothes. A French naval</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer, smartly uniformed and dapper, ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king his way through the crowd, seemed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">some strange being from another century.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As she paused for a moment to allow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jew to overtake her, she felt a sensation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">giddiness as her mind escaped the bonds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion and readjusted itself to reality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a little distance along her guide turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">off down a cobbled lane to the left and pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently halted at a narrow blue door.

The yellow sun threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arched veranda into violet shade, cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">and restful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man clapped his hands and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">response a young girl with prominent dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, and rosy cheeks appeared. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in a dark-blue caftan; twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">'round her black hair was a brilliantly yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low kerchief, and in her small ears large gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">earrings. He said something in Hebrew,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whereat she laughed merrily and moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, her slippers shuffling over the tiles, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reappear with another woman similarly</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad but elderly and stout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miriam was soon seated, uncomfortably</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough in European costume, upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of one of the mattresses on the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sweet coffee was brought. The old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat quietly in one corner, his wife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter near to Miriam talking politely in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish. Their eyes, shyly inquisitive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioned every article of her attire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually Miriam began to lose her sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strangeness and led the talk upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways and customs of the country, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trend of opinion concerning the present sul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tan and the general situation, gaining copy</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a good journalist should. When at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length Miriam intimated that she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to leave they insisted that she must</seg><seg type="columnLine">break bread with them. Miriam felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer sense of shame in pretending to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">test that she must go whilst she really</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished and intended to stay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The breaking of bread was a ceremonious</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair of many dishes; chiefly cous-cous, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arab dish of semolina but made in the Jew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish style with raisins. Although she soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt very much at home there was an ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">recurring sense of incongruity. The man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ipulation of her Parisian-shod feet troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">her; her sun-hat became an abomination</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her comparatively loose skirt developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tentacles of an octopus in cramping her</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs. She longed to throw them away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and envied the cool caftan and bare feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little goggle-eyed Jewess. Boots in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed seemed a sacrilege on the smooth tiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last she was driven to discard her hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, scarcely realizing what she was doing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so fumbled with her hairpins that her long</seg><seg type="columnLine">black tresses rolled down her back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration of her hostess and daughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There seemed an atavistic sense of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural environment in the air. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impelled to confide in the patriarch sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">there so wise and dignified. She felt sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they would not betray her. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment she conquered the desire and, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">compromise, began to talk of Agadir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man, Musa Ben Ibrahim, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed the place to her. She was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of exaltation when he announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had relatives and many business</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends there.

Ben Ibrahim wagged a forefinger in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissent. It would be quite impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a boat of any sort to undertake the trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Mogador. He advised her friend not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attempt it. The land journey was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual way, but dangerous even for Moorish</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Jewish merchants. Miriam's heart sank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">|||pp] AT THAT moment little Zara, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">i||||| had taken a great fancy to Miriam</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had seated herself as close as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she dared to her, could restrain her curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity no longer. Her black eyes goggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with excitement she craved permission to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see and handle a string of blue Egyptian</seg><seg type="columnLine">beads which Miriam wore. Miriam un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened and handed them to Zara who</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelped with delighted admiration, flinging a</seg><seg type="columnLine">score of questions. Then Miriam, her dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment dulled for the moment by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distraction, asked to be allowed to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's hair kerchief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zara laughed delightedly at the compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment as she quickly unwound it. Miriam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after admiring the texture, laughingly put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her own head. Zara, quick to grasp an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea, wriggled over and bound it in the Jew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish fashion over Miriam's long hair, and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with many "Eh! ehs!" of admiration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing a triumphant podgy finger. Mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iam glanced at her host. He was staring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her in amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Abraham!" he cried. "Look, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, she is one of us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miriam flushed and laughed. Zara, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little cry sprang up and pattered away, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned, staggering under the weight of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gilded mirror which her father assisted her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest on the floor. Miriam gave an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntary cry of astonishment. The bright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow kerchief bound about her own raven</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair, her own large Latin eyes, olive-tinted</seg><seg type="columnLine">complexion and red lips formed the picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a typical Oriental Jewess, peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazedly. With heavy gold earrings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the caftan the resemblance would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment or two Miriam was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noyed. Then she gave a gasp and sat back</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly, staring at the patriarch in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. The solution of the problem of en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering Agadir had flashed into her mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Jewish garb nobody, not even a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Moor, would suspect her American na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionality. She felt an almost overwhelming</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to hug the old man, to tear off her</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots and European clothes, to dance, sing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh, and cry at the same time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an effort she controlled herself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled and gave back the kerchief to Zara.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As a preliminary, she told little Zara to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the Egyptian necklace, to the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's wild delight, who, not to be outdone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in courtesy, insisted that Miriam should ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept the hair kerchief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miriam now keen upon business, thanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her absent-mindedly. She reflected that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this man had relatives at Agadir and busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness dealings. He would surely be send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, or having a share, sooner or later, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some caravan going to Agadir. She must</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuade him to let her go disguised as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jewess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Talking and smiling abstractedly she</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought out her plan of action. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemplated going as a Moorish woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as such great difficulties would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be overcome; for her liberty would be neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarily restricted, and she had no liking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust herself in the hands of any Moor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A panic seized her that Alan or some other</seg><seg type="columnLine">correspondent might arrive at any moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She must lose no time but strike whilst the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity served. After a short pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amble to the effect that she was a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">writer in which she had some difficulty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">convincing them--they seemed to think it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great joke and laughed discreditingly--she</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged straight into her proposition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first it was received with uplifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms of horror. It was impossible--if any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing happened the American consul would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold him responsible. But when Miriam</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out that she was prepared to pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">well the refusals became less emphatic; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she hinted that there were sure to be other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jews who would not be so timid. After an</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited colloquy with his wife amid much</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesticulation he agreed. Then came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crux of the argument--the price. For all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his patriarchal bencvolence and hospitality,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mention of douro--long and gesticula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory was the bargaining, but at length it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was completed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no caravan leaving for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks, he protested; but in consideration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain money one should leave on the mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row with Miriam in charge of his son and</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Zara as her maid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sky was a pageant of scarlet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">IO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">amber, fading to violet over the dense blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea as Miriam returned to the hotel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here she discovered the proprietor in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of incoherent excitement imploring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the consul to organize a search-party as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ahmed had returned with the news that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Vickers had been kidnaped.

As they approached, riding in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insolent manner of the conquering race,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Jewish party drove their animals off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the track to allow them to pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Jews cringed as the white-clad leaders</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode in haughty silence, apparently unaware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their presence. The ragged mob of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">escort favored them with disdainful glances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few muttered "Ya Houdi (Jew)!" accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panying the reproach with a contemptuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">spit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as the three came abreast of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, one, a falcon-faced man, deliber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately rode over to the elder of the two girls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled up his horse so that it barred her</seg><seg type="columnLine">donkey's progress and bending over in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle peered insolently into her face. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he made a loud remark in Arabic with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming teeth and eyes afire, the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, a few paces behind, screamed in alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The men of their party stared helplessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The large sloe eyes of the girl were wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">with alarm as she tried to drive her donkey</seg><seg type="columnLine">'round, exclaiming:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Zid! zid (go on)."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other horsemen who had slowed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the fun, laughed and shouted ribald</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarks.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">nursed, too, a sullen resentment against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men of her escort, despising them for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their craven attitude, wholly forgetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were unarmed and, moreover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of a race down-trodden and abused</seg><seg type="columnLine">for centuries by her aggressor's people.

There was a look of relief on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face as if rejoicing at the prospect of losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the responsibility of his charge, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed, pointing a dirty finger:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, signorina!

Her host was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildewed little man, a snuffling wheezy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shylock, rapacious-eyed and predatory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose; the hostess, a pallid bundle of dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes. As a consolation there were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">little girls with gollywog eyes and pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocious minds who seemed gifted with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disinterested affection for Miriam, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">which little Zara, out of jealousy perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly pronounced to be cupboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that night as Miriam, after a lick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a promise with the aid of a cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">jar of water, saw to the safety of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage, consisting of two fountain pens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a supply of ink and paper and a revolver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was in an irritable state of mind as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as body--particularly of body! All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">romance of the great adventure seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have died--bitten to death as Miriam</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed it savagely.

The spell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">misery was broken. As she wriggled her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head on the hard pillow made of a bundle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of robes, and stretched her stiff and aching</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs, she chuckled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day Miriam spent in writing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She went for a ramble in the evening under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the escort of Yakub to the ramparts over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking the bay, keenly observing the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vironment and catechizing him. Fortu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nately Yakub was a native of the place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that she was able to glean brief biog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raphies and estimate the relative im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance of the notables, including a</seg><seg type="columnLine">garbled history of the place--half of which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfortunately long after the copy had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent away, she sadly discovered to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">originated in the fertile brain of Yakub,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too eager to please.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed out to her the palace of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">khalifa--a bad man and cruel according</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Yakub--in the western end of the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">just beyond the principal mosque. Imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately she desired to visit it. Yakub was</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrified; he flatly refused to make any</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to take her through the town at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all until a bald promise of much backsheesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">set his wits to work. Eventually he arrived</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at the conclusion that the visit might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished in company with two old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jewesses who were permitted to visit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">harem ladies to sell various trinkets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trading stuffs, but stipulating that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">require still more hassani to bribe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Miriam made a faint effort at haggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yakub's eyes glinted greedily as he tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think of some other tangible excuse for</seg><seg type="columnLine">extracting more money. So it was settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the venture was to be made upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Miriam sat herself upon an ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannon mounted upon a clumsy wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriage, the wheels of which were made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thick planks of wood bound together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with heavy cross-laths, the impotent muzzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing through the embrasure command-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the bay. Away to the west of her was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little fishing-village of Fonti which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed on their trail, a few European-</seg><seg type="columnLine">built towing-boats lying upon the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch of sand. About half a mile out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar boat was approaching the town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distant oar-blades sparkling in the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As she leaned idly admiring the deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue waters of the bay there floated out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">call to prayer from the distant mosque:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Al-lah Ak-ba-ahl Allah il AllahI La</seg><seg type="columnLine">illaha il Allah, wa Mohammed er-rasool</seg><seg type="columnLine">Al-la-a-ahl"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE call rising in three notes to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-pitched chant, rang out eerie</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plaintive, dying away in sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">cadence to a faint echo in the hill beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be, caught up quite near her by another</seg><seg type="columnLine">mueddin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first time that Miriam had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the call to prayer she had been deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed with the beauty and the calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery, in such antithesis to the fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">lustful creed which it represented. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in Agadir isolated from any of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind the effect was intensified. She glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">across at Yakub who was squatting in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade of the rampart staring craftily at</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, an avaricious smile playing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth--probably thinking of the dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was going to make.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She felt that time had buckled back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fifteenth century; that she was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">another period, for the medieval environ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was perfect.

Noah she was sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Double Scoop</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was the replica of the dignified Ben Ibrahim</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Mogador.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An approaching footstep startled her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She looked up to see a man of medium</seg><seg type="columnLine">height in European clothes advancing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stared for a moment, unable to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes; then panic seized her that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had failed after all; that this man was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">correspondent who had stolen a march on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. He wore a shabby suit of gray, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light red tie, a dirty collar and a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">artisan's cap. His lean face was shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a hatchet; two pale eyes peered sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a predatory nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miriam glanced at Yakub interrogatively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He appeared startled and put one finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Ins lips suggestively.

Miriam felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt in the look and flushed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">annoyance, forgetting the guise in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw her. Then when nearly abreast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her he turned his head abruptly as if vexed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her scrutiny. He was about to replace</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cigaret in his mouth, but the hand re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained in mid-air as he paused and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately stared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miriam wondered what paper he repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented and tried to decide whether he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">English or not. She thought not. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed on, looked 'round twice and, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">having made up his mind, turned back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came straight toward her. Miriam heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a muttered exclamation from Yakub. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly recollecting that she was a Jewess</seg><seg type="columnLine">she looked the other way and cast down</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes, wondering what he was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. She felt an impulse to speak to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in French. It would be such a luxury</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk to a fellow-European--even if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a rival correspondent--and if a for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eigner it did not matter very much. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt him look her up and down deliberately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">insolently, and involuntarily she blushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ashkoonik?" he demanded abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She heard Yakub reply for her.

She was as active as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leopardess and had a petulant discon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tented expression. Miriam made friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the aid of a silver bangle upon ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serving that she could speak Spanish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her name was Ramah and her face lit up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with mischievous pleasure on learning what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miriam desired her to do. Gossip is half</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soul of a Moorish woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two, three, four more days passed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still no sign of the promised diplomatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">coup. Miriam began to think uneasily of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those close-written sheets she had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patched by special runner to her agent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mogador. Except for an early morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk upon the ramparts approached by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circuitous route in the vain hope of seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war-ship, Miriam, after the episode in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sok, was kept almost a close prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Jewish house. On the third day, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miriam's annoyance, the baron walked into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. He apologized for calling, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cusing himself on the grounds that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard that she had not taken his advice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was anxious for her safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dismissed the Jews from the room in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an autocratic manner. Miriam objected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he feigned not to have heard her. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a born raconteur; he entertained her</seg><seg type="columnLine">with vivid stories of sport, duelling, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigue and adventure in every capital in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe to the wilds of Borneo and China.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seemed to have been everywhere and</seg><seg type="columnLine">done everything--and everybody, beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">down Miriam's antipathy until at times she</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought him the most fascinating man she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever met. Again he urged her to leave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing at her the whole time with undis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guised admiration.

She stared, drinking in the sight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking with a triumphant smile of Alan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was aroused from her pleasing reverie</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an exclamation from Yakub and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to see the baron approaching her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, good evening, Miss Vickers."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look!

He glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">'round cautiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who art thou?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ra-mah!" came the reply deliciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet.

A passionate desire suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">welled up within her to cry peccavi, to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Alan and throwing her arms 'round his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck to sob her heart out. She had to set</seg><seg type="columnLine">her teeth to conquer the surge of emotion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It passed; she smiled bitterly in the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment there was a patter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small slippered feet.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment Yakub and the rest of the family</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gathered in a gesticulating group.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Out of the medley of voices Miriam heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yakub crying at her:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thou hast brought this upon us!

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">upshot was that they were hysterically de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to throw Miriam out of the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">then and there to save themselves. Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zara remonstrated, crying shrilly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miriam might be hidden away; but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion was met with howls, proclaim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that death was sure if she were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">found by the khalifa's people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Yusuf stood by the arch leading to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door; wringing his hands he implored her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go and called upon all the prophets of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pentateuch; the wife wailed helplessly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him; the child with the lantern dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitedly between Miriam and her father</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an erratic dragonfly, clutching at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes; whilst Yakub, gibbering with craven</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, hovered about Miriam trying to sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon sufficient courage to eject her forcibly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miriam with faithful little Zara clinging to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one arm, defied them--head up and curling</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips--in a mixture of Anglo-Spanish cum</seg><seg type="columnLine">Franco-Arabic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN in the midst of the uproar</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a fresh commotion at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Old Yusuf shrieked and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent flying on to his face; the child dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lantern, which spluttered and went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a group of armed men burst into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courtyard. There was a moment of para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyzed silence. The leader, a tall hawk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced Arab, peered 'round by the aid of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern carried by a negro. Then simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously the howls broke out afresh. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Miriam darted behind a pillar the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooped upon her. In a trice rough hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized her. A blanket was bundled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head. She felt herself lifted by wiry</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. Struggling violently, mad with rage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was borne swiftly away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The enveloping blanket produced the suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">focation of a nightmare; the powerful arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dreadful sense of impotence. Miriam</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled futilely until she collapsed into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp burden from sheer exhaustion, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she dimly heard the mutter of voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scuffle of animals. The sensation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being lifted in the air roused her to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">paroxysm. She felt the gentle undulating</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion of a horse or mule walking, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muffled klop Hop of hoofs upon cobbles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The journey seemed to last for hours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As her senses began to revive a little she</seg><seg type="columnLine">became acutely conscious that the coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair of the blanket scratched her face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, forcing a pungent acrid taste into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. The chaos of her mind caused by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shock began to clear. Lucid thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped swiftly. She jumped to the conclu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion that she was being taken to the kha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifa's palace. In a second of time her imagi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation painted a vivid picture of what her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate would be. She shuddered and groaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with anguish. Wildly she thought of ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape; of some method to take her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">life rather than ....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A nausea overwhelmed her. She lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of time and space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then after an eternity she became con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious that she was lying on something soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the cool night air was fanning her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks. She drew a long breath, sighed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened her eyes. Bending over, his sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">features in the light of a lantern, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must have rescued her then? A feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of relief and gratitude glowed for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. He at least could never be so terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble as a Moor. The baron was holding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass of brandy which he bade her drink in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curiously low tone. Strange. Miriam</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered, with that irrelevance of thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">in moments of distress, why his voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so soft. Like a gentle purr it seemed. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed at him and tried to think what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to happen, but the one idea of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleness of his voice seemed to obsess</seg><seg type="columnLine">her brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was talking about something, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not grasp the sense. Then the alcohol</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to take effect. She found her mind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">coming under control again and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehend what he was saying. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about regrets for some action. What,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for rescuing her? How absurd! She tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to thank him, but found her lips were stiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swollen. The liquor stung them too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are feeling better?" he inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miriam mumbled inarticulately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So? Allow me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he bent down and rearranged some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cushions. How kind he was, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baron! The predominant terror that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to fall into the savage Moor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">power had for the time driven the baron's</seg><seg type="columnLine">character from her mind. Then the asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciation of ideas stirred the memory cells</seg><seg type="columnLine">into activity. She sat up, spurred by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" she gasped thickly. "Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you kidnap me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The baron had put down the lantern--</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no one else in the starlit court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard--and was sitting beside her. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth twisted into that snarling smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you like," he said shrugging his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, "to put it so crudely. So?" as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miriam made a movement of disgust.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You beautiful little fool," he said bending</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward her, "I saved you from a vile fate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That black swine was going to take you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herr Gotti What do you think I have risked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you, Liebchen? Everything for you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eight years have I plotted and schemed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Empire--ja, here in the Sus.

"Mein lieber Gott, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely fool, I will tame you. Ja, I meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take you, but not until I was ready.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then that cochon of a Moor--in two days</seg><seg type="columnLine">my boat will be here to take us--us, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">angel devil, to Cape Juby where we two</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be the German interests in the Sus.

But we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend the first two days here, so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a pause. Holding her a pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner by the wrist he devoured her panting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivering figure with his eyes. Voices and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clatter of horses sounded some distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give me a kiss, Liebchen!" he demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly and leaned toward her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miriam shrieked and made a frantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to tear her wrist loose. He sat back</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Double Scoop</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">retaining his hold and chuckled as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched her struggle and scream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Shriek, you sweet little devil, you!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said with an evil smile. "Women's screams</seg><seg type="columnLine">are music in Morocco--so! Come! That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough!" and he drew her to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miriam kicked madly and beat him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one free hand like the wing of a cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured bird.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUDDENLY came a guttural oath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The baron was lifted bodily from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, releasing his hold at the bidding</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the instinct of self-preservation. Miriam</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell back panting, wild-eyed, to find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room full of red-capped sodliers, creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the khalifa. In a flash she realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nemesis had overtaken the baron in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealous wrath of the khalifa, but that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reserved for a worse fate. Amid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guttural remarks of the Moors, she saw, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light of several lanterns, the baron, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless as a trussed fowl, his face distorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rage, in the hands of a gigantic negro</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave, who grinned with hellish delight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A wild thought of self-destruction flashed -</seg><seg type="columnLine">athwart her mind, but before she had time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to recover even her power of speech, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers unceremoniously lifted her by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and ankles and carried her out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She felt too stunned and helpless to offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">futile resistance this time; numbed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful fear. She was hoisted on to the pom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mel before a mounted negro. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dim scuffle of horses and men, harsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">commands and exclamations. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavalcade started forward. Miriam, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted and beaten, sobbing, swung limp</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the motion of the horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the procession climbed up the dusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow streets toward the governor's palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">the early morning call to prayer rang out</seg><seg type="columnLine">resonant and clear beneath the shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Allah--Ak-ba-ak-- La illaha U-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miriam did not swoon this time.

The flickering lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lanterns carried by the slaves on foot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced ghostlike on the white walls. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark of the head of her captor was sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">silhouetted against the stars. They seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rock and sway giddily. She wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely why the face was beardless. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">cock crowed near by.

That son of shame, that pig</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an unbeliever Es-sid-el-Keleeb? he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would soon be paying for his insult to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beloved of Mahomet.

Now I'll warn you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to keep close tabs on you, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am warning you and if you win I lose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ferret raised his expressive eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's mighty square of you, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson," he said.

Being a sport, Henderson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to all the trainmen, did not help to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the Ferret conspicuous by even</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodding to him but he took a seat across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aisle and a little back of his man, lit one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warden's cigars and kept a casual, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen eye on the Ferret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ferret looked out of the window for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while at the green meadows of West-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chester County, at the green woodlands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue distance, the nigh flowers, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds, at a butterfly that vagrantly fluttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">28</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with the train for a few seconds and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a look in the eyes that would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised Henderson, almost a suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dew that might still be moist on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferns in the shady coppices. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought a paper from the news-butcher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a paper and an orange, and glanced at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-forbidden luxury while he slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed the other, segment by segment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he sat up, absorbed in an item.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Henderson noticed the swift change,</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed the heading of the paper, bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">one himself when the boy came through</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and read where the Ferret was reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the second time. There was no dewy</seg><seg type="columnLine">look in the Ferret's eyes now, only the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine of gray steel. And into Henderson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes crept a look of triumph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did I tell the warden," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henderson to himself, "what'd I tell him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What he's reading is like catnip to an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom. He's sore he wasnft in on it. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth's watering now, I'll bet. Wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I'll get on the case?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he settled himself to read the item</seg><seg type="columnLine">with professional absorption.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There had been a week-end gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Long Island home of a Wall Street</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful broker, whose wife affected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">close acquaintanceship of Bohemia. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests had many names famous in the Four</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arts plus the Art of the Theater and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roof Garden and there were others more</seg><seg type="columnLine">eccentric than famous, a rollicking, uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventional crew who had participated in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancy-dress dance, starting in the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">transferred to the moonlit, lantern-painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawn and winding up with an early break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast at the Country Club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the next morning the pearls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostess were missing, after many of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests had departed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not a matter for the police,</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared the hostess.

An</seg><seg type="columnLine">infatuated, foolish woman, a shrewd ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venturer, the five hundred an acknowledg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of attempted blackmail and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">implied willingness to meet it. Busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband and idle wife. The old triangle</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff.

But he kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ferret in view when the train got in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Ferret wandered along almost jauntily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an idler in New York. He bought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardenia from a police-dodging vender,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelled it and set it in his lapel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolled on again, the flower utterly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeming the cheapness of his suit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Fifth Avenue he made his way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the library steps and, standing beside one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the supercilious twin lions, a woman met</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. She was no taller than the Ferret</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she was slender, her clothes giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">her a youth that still lingered in her quick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">impetuous rush, matched by the Ferret's</seg><seg type="columnLine">embrace. Henderson caught sight of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully tinted face, that yet did not avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ferret's kiss, of hair carefully made</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden, and he smiled as he passed on. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Ferret and the Bet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was through with the Ferret for the present.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he felt reasonably sure of his bet.

They all fall for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them," he told himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was looking at the only side he knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seamy one, he did not guess that rouge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and powder and eyebrow-pencils that hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ravages of time are sometimes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camouflage of love, love that seeks to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and is a little afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're lookin' fine, Jim.

Also, at the arbori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culturist's he might hear of a job. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warden had promised to give him ref-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erences that would not hold the taint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his work having been done in the peni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentiary. And, to the Ferret, the warden</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a good deal of a surprise and somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a god, a superman, at least, one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">never failed in his promises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN he walked aboard the ferry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made his way forward to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows, a red-headed, pasty-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">man spotted him and followed him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferret did not see the man, for he walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently as a cat, until the latter caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by the elbow and, as the Ferret swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">slewed his neck to look at him, led the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Flynn.

Land, a house, tools, young</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants in the upturned soil. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swept the thoughts from his brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sat frowning until his station was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big grower was cordial and sympa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thetic but the Ferret was soon convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">how utterly impracticable was his plan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With war-prices and war-payments he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to spend all his scanty hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fertilizer alone. The grower offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a certain credit for plants when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">once established but where was the rent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from for the land, the dwelling, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living-expenses?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say you can get recommendations,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the grower. "I can place you in a job.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good salary. I wouldn't wonder if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find a place for your wife if she's</seg><seg type="columnLine">handy. No kids, you say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said the Ferret slowly, "no kids."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I know they are having a hard time</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their help. It isn't far from here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Rogers. You can tell them I sent you</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. They are a bit upset at this time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had a robbery night before last. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare say Mrs. Haskins'll see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ferret listened to the directions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started for the Haskins place. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the best thing to do for the present,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially if Nan got on, and that should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be easy. For Nan was more than just</seg><seg type="columnLine">handy; she had been a maid when he first</seg><seg type="columnLine">met her, much as Flynn was going to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl he mentioned. But there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar irony in it all. He and Nan, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">con and ex-con's wife, applying for a job in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where a pearl necklace had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen, for this was the Mrs. Haskins of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the news item. It was risky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If he was ever tipped off of course he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an alibi as to the necklace; no one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">accuse a man of robbery who was in jail</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it occurred. But every place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">risky in a way and, since he had no capital,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not turn down the first chance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The warden would manage his credentials.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The warden did not believe in showing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seamy side of a man who was trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make good. He would only say that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">recommended the pattern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mrs. Haskins is somewhere in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden," the maid told him, and, if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come about a gardener's position, he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well see her there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the Ferret trod the walks between</seg><seg type="columnLine">trim lawns and flower-beds, through a rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden and so down, as directed by a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was handling watering-hose, to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrace backed by a yew hedge, high as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferret's head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked along the hedge toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gap of its entrance on to the terrace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Ferret and the Bet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">screened himself by masses of shrubbery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his trained ears caught the syllables</seg><seg type="columnLine">of earnest talk and, from a nature not yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">subdued, listened with the habit of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent profession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So, when I saw the news in the paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning, Helen, I made up my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come over and see what could be done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got up late but I came as soon as I could.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm terribly sorry about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the Ferret had learned to read men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in many ways, by looks, by apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">trivial actions and by the intonations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voice. This voice sounded frank, sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathetic as it was cultured, but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a purring quality to it that made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferret distrust its owner before he saw him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feel sure that his suspicion was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed. It was the voice of a man accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed to talk much with women--a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could flatter readily and did--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could charm and woo, the voice of a stage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman's voice was harder to inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pret. It held a hint of fear, a hint of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sincerity, or of fence, but it was charming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the Ferret, rooted suddenly, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you see the reward I offered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton? Harry was very kind about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He offered to make it more but I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was enough. And I want my pearls</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, Clinton. I love them. The money</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not matter so much but they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry's wedding-gift to me and I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The insincerity, or whatever it was, left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voice as she spoke of her desire for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gems. Then it came back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you suggest anything, Clinton?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't. I'm a dub at such things. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose you might double the reward if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't get any response. The necklace is</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth much more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It cost ten thousand dollars. But--</seg><seg type="columnLine">whoever took it--would not be easily able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dispose of it, Harry says. Mr. Throop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jeweler, told him that the pearls would</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose value immediately they were separated</seg><seg type="columnLine">or sold unmatched, and of course the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">description was in the paper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. But I think I should double that</seg><seg type="columnLine">reward tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ferret did not shift his position but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes hardened and his fists clenched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clinton," went on the woman. "Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you remember you promised to return to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me those two letters I sent you. They did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not mean anything. They were just foolish</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters but Harry--won't you let me have</seg><seg type="columnLine">them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will, tomorrow, Belle. If there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing else I can do, I'll be getting back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the 5:50. That is, if you're not going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask me to stay to dinner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed as he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, it isn't convenient tonight, Clin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I were you I'd telephone to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">jeweler people and also to the paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubling that reward. I think it will bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">results. You say your husband was willing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to increase it. And I'll send you those--</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish--letters you speak of."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ferret looked at his cheap but com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petent watch. It was 5130 and the station</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a full mile back. He intended to catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 5150. The job--could wait. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the woman moved on. Doubtless they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going back to the house. The Ferret</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambuscaded behind the shrubs, glimpsed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">graceful figure and pretty face of the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and paid especial attention to the man, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">handsome, somewhat haggard chap, fault-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly dressed, who passed on with a covert</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile as he passed out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within a hundred yards of the station</seg><seg type="columnLine">a car sped by the hurrying Ferret and in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat the man whose first name was Clinton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He got out at the station and the car re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward the Haskins place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up-town, and later, the man whose first</seg><seg type="columnLine">name was Clinton descended from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevated in the nineties and walked to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of a bachelor-apartment house which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he opened with a key. He entered. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute later the Ferret inspected the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">foyer and noted a card that read:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton Howard Bowdin. Apt. 8.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at the rest of the names,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently comparing them with an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velop he carried, frowned and crossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, seemingly looking at numbers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he glanced back at the house he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, quite casually. It was dark and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the windows were already illumin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Apartment eight," mused the Ferret.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That should be on the top floor back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seven is in front. No one home there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked up the street and back again</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. Three doors from the house that</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton Bowdin had entered was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently vacant--"To Let" signs in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NAN greeted the Ferret expec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tantly. Supper was ready for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The first home meal, Jim," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Any news? Or do you want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep it until after supper?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No news, old girl," he said. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospects. And I have to go out after</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper."	'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did not question him but, after he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone, she went into the bedroom where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been rummaging in a closet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself reached down a box on the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shelf. Hardly knowing she carried it</seg><seg type="columnLine">she bore it into the next room and sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily with the box on her lap. Her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was old now, old and pinched between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines, and gray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has taken his keys and his gun,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she repeated to herself over and over as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she rocked, her face a mask of dread--</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread and sorrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BTHE Ferret entered the doorway of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vacant house like a shadow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deftly set in the lock a twisted piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tempered wire. A little pull, a pause, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick thrust and a turn and the lock slid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadowed door opened and closed again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two minutes later the scuttle leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the roof lifted and the Ferret emerged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping well back from the front coping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making his swift and subtle progress over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roofs. He tried the scuttle-hatch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house that stood the third below and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it tightly fastened from within.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardly visible in the gloom, he glided to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the roof, peered over, tested a gutter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let himself down with the agility of a gym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nast, swinging to his hands, and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">without noise on to the top landing of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire-escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The landing was outside a room before</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose window a blind was drawn, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bottom, all but an inch. The Ferret</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent--looked through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Handsome Clinton Bowdin was seated at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a table gazing at a lustrous string of pearls</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasped by a sapphire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wondering if she's doubled that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward," the Ferret told himself.

With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precision of an expert he inserted something</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the sashes upward, gave a twist</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the handle of the instrument and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch was sprung with the tiniest of clicks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within, Bowdin did not move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ferret nosed the breeze, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperceptible, tried its strength with a wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger and then a loosely held bit of paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He eased up the bottom sash with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tool that had started the catch and, inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">by inch under his wide-spread fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick to sense any lack of balance, the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">pane moved upward, back of the blind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bowdin put back the necklace into its</seg><seg type="columnLine">case and took up two letters that he read</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with a sneering smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cheap at the price," he said.

In spite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty various explanations given in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers, "Tumbo" means "stomach," neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">more nor less. And "Blighty" means Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. It is one of Tommy's adaptations</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Hindustani--a language he twists</seg><seg type="columnLine">and changes to suit himself when in India</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, when time-expired, brings home in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments with which to adulterate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever-growing English language.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Originally the word is vilayli, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">means European.

On the third day at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reasoner's appearance Hobo had made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">start toward washing, while all around him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men were bathing ancf preparing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrub their clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reasoner was not impatient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hate to keep a man penned up like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog," he said, "and so I let you have a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. You could have joined the divi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, Singleton, but I guess a man takes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time to break a bad habit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without being told, Hobo took his bucket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went for water for his scrubbing. True</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his word, Reasoner had the cook take</seg><seg type="columnLine">only water to the prisoner that day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another week and the ship was in port,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the men going ashore on liberty. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole forward divisions held Hobo Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">in open contempt. They referred to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the "life-termer," but knew that once a</seg><seg type="columnLine">home port was reached he would be dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged as undesirable. None of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to reach Smith. In his pen for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward he was carelessly indifferent, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">only real discomfort was the daily scrub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing under the eye of Reasoner. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reasoner went ashore for a day, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that Smith had missed the scrubbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The man seems to have no sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor," said Lieutenant Thorne to the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieutenant. "Reasoner seems to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed in his cure this time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is at least keeping him from infect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the ship," said the first lieutenant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why not have a marine watch him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reasoner is away?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the next port when Reasoner went</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore, Lieutenant Thorne asked for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine sentry, and Hobo Smith found him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self under the eyes of another master. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reasoner there had grown up a little morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing routine which never varied. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been "Good morning, Singleton," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a sullen silence, Smith had begun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say "Good morning." Never had there</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, except on the first morning, any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to begin work. Smith had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced as soon as Reasoner appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get busy, you scum," ordered the sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith looked the marine over and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Work or you don't eat," taunted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Smith sat down on the deck with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back to the other and refused to scrub.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That day he had only water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reasoner was pleased when he returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a hopeful sign," he said to Slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Higgins. "The word is 'defiance'. It's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-third cousin to self-respect. If a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man has it, he may have better qualities."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us hope so," said Slim.

He interfered in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure with the freedom of the already-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded forecastle, and unless he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">show results some other method of dealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the man would have to be tried. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">way came unexpectedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ashore again, seeing the sights with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend Slim Higgins, a poor, half-starved</seg><seg type="columnLine">puppy, wandering drunkenly on its weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs across the pavement, was shoved off</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the gutter by a careless foot, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just missed stepping on it. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog whined pleadingly, with its front paws</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the curb, as it tried vainly to drag itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slim Higgins went on by, but Reasoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks like he's homeless," he said, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicating the dog, which redoubled its puny</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts to climb to the sidewalk, as it saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one had noticed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on," said Slim, "I'd think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had enough pets on your hands with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hobo on the ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Reasoner had extended a big hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and helped the puppy back to firmer foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to take him along," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced.

"You've made friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty quick. Let him share your rations</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he gets bigger." Reasoner got up as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the matter was settled. "Singleton," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "after this week you go to regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith knew from the tone what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant. He was to have a chance to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, and the dog was the prize. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved dogs. He had a queer influence over</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Back during the old days on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road he walked fearlessly up to the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage ones and made friends. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep in him that was almost dead came</seg><seg type="columnLine">feebly to life. He smiled at Reasoner, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand still stroking the sleeping puppy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks," he said, "you're a good old</seg><seg type="columnLine">scout."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith took his place in the division</seg><seg type="columnLine">humbly. The first morning at inspection</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Thorne had him step from ranks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turn 'round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get a better fit next time," he said, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith's uniform was clean, and his shoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">shined, and there was no fault to find.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Smith's place was not an easy one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was behind on the drills, slow at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, looked down upon by his shipmates.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The only thing that he did do well was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrub clothes, and look after Arab, the Aire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dale puppy, who had begun to put on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaggy coat of his breed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That pup's got sense," confided Slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Higgins to Reasoner. "The little microbe</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows who's a friend to his master, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is not. You let me go within a yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him and he backs off and growls, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets you handle him most as easy as Smith."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pets are popular on a ship, and the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon found that to win the dog's favor they</seg><seg type="columnLine">must speak civilly to his master, and Hobo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith made a few friends, while he stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily improved in his work. But when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew up a ditty-box on a Wednesday after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon to a group playing cards, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">never asked to take a hand. No one shared</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tobacco with him. If he ran out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">soap before the monthly small stores were</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued, he could only borrow from Rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the groups that went ashore he trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eled alone, so far as human company was</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned, but accompanied always by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog. As time went on and Arab grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arab</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rangy and long-legged, Smith kept with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him more and more, and began to seek less</seg><seg type="columnLine">and less to establish a place for himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the crew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reasoner had it out with him many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What you want to do is to get a trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fer to some other ship. This bunch here</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized you up wrong in the beginning, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can't see that you've changed. Son,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a word for you here in the book</seg><seg type="columnLine">that'll tell the whole story. It's 'forfend.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">It means to ward off. By getting away</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll escape all this criticism of what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe you're right," said Smith. "I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to get away from this bunch, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's the dog. If I go, Arab will have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay on. He's mine, but another ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">might make me give him up. I can stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">most anything for Arab." And the dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat a tattoo on the deck with his tail in</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of Smith's most persistent enemies</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ship was Engle, a huge recruit coal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passer. He systematically nagged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">goaded both Smith and his dog, smearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up Smith's paint work with his greasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, and lacking at Arab whenever the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion offered. His hobby was shark</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishing, and most every hour off watch, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the forecastle with a line off the side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had found out from the complaints of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others just the part of the ship that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Smith's duty to scrub, and usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his station there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith and his dog were playing tag the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next morning when Engle came forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They drew aside to let him pass. The coal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passer had been unable to secure bait at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the galley, and a brilliant scheme to settle</seg><seg type="columnLine">two scores came to him as he saw the dog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without a word he stepped quickly for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and grasped the puppy by the neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let him be, you'll hurt him," resented</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hobo Smith angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up, you bum," retorted Engle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm going to make shark bait of this pup."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dog hung snarling and twisting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand, trying vainly to get a hold with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let him go," cried Smith, and made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dive for the dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Engle, much larger and stronger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith, let him come on until he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">close, and then holding the dog out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach, sent his fist crashing into Hobo's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">face, who in his anxiety over the dog, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not tried to guard himself. The blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked him backward over a ditty-box,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he did not get up. Not until then did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dog whine, and redouble its efforts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bite the hand that held it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holding the squirming puppy between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees, Engle lashed it firmly to the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">shark hook, and going out on the boat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boom, threw his line overboard. Half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen men yelled to the big coal-passer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">haul the dog back aboard. Arab had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">some friends, and after they were sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engle was not joking, they made protest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Engle defied them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dog's no good, anyhow," he 'said, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first fellow that tries to do anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll knock him off the boom to help feed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the men hung back, Reasoner came</seg><seg type="columnLine">running forward. The little dog was swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming valiantly with the heavy hook, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about spent. Instead of shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Engle, Reasoner climbed out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shame on you," he cried, "haul that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pup in!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Engle did not intend to back down in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of those watching, so he took the fish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line in the hand that held to the boom's</seg><seg type="columnLine">supporting stay, and faced Reasoner de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While all eyes were centered on Reasoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Engle, no attention was paid to Hobo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith. He crawled dizzily to his feet, saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was going on, lurched to the rail and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped overboard to the rescue of his pet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Engle was the larger of the two men on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boom, and had the advantage of posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion because he held to the stay, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down at an angle of forty-five degrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ship's side to the end of the boom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could reach it for support, while Rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soner could not, who had only the slack</seg><seg type="columnLine">life-line. As Reasoner advanced Engle saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opportunity, and untied the life-line</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the stay, hoping to throw his antago-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nist off by swaying it sidewise, but Reasoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut the line behind him, and threw it aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming at Engle without support, balanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the narrow spar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had lost the slowness which charac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terized his usual manner. His loose body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tense, catlike, and every movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick and sure. Foot by foot he advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the coal-passer. Engle tied the fish-line</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stay so that he could have both</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, and shook the boom in a final effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to throw Reasoner off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Haul in," ordered Reasoner, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached striking distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Engle's answer was to take a firmer grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stay and kick out with both feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reasoner dodged backward, balancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself on the shaking boom, and acted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suggestion that Engle had given. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the coal-passer could quite recover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reasoner had rushed, and instead of strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him and both men going overboard, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped into the air and caught the stay well</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Engle's head. Then hanging from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands he kicked the other man off the boom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not until then did the master-at-arms see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Hobo Smith had reached the dog, cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fish-line with his knife, and with Arab</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting on his shoulder, had made the gang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and was climbing out of the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The assembled ship's company had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole affair, and from it they knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hobo Smith would fight anybody, and dare</seg><seg type="columnLine">most anything to save his dog, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick Reasoner would back him up. Engle</seg><seg type="columnLine">swam to the gangway, climbed up, and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. He had a bump on his cheek the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of an egg where one of Reasoner's shoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had landed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From then on Hobo Smith had more as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surance. The men treated him with more</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect. He had been licked of course, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had shown fight against a larger man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next morning at the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">court Engle was given five days</seg><seg type="columnLine">bread and water for punishment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first lieutenant had arrived on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene in time to see the wind-up, and a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation had to be given by Reasoner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the beginning of bad times for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engle. A few weeks later he picked a quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rel with a fireman while on watch, struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man over the head with a shovel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was given a summary court-martial with</seg><seg type="columnLine">three months loss of pay, and thirty days'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Confinement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That dog of yours is to blame," whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered Engle to Smith. "When I get out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, I'm going to poison him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Smith, his newly-found manhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting uncertainly on his soul, while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought the prejudice of the crew, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart wrapped up in the beloved Arab,</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed the threat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fireman that Engle had struck did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not do well in the hospital. He took a sud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">den change for the worse. Engle's case be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came more serious. His thirty days up, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still confined. If the man died, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be held for murder. Again he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance and whispered to Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help me to get away, or I'll kill the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just how he intended to do it while con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fined in the brig he did not explain, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith was interested only in Arab's safety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He asked no questions. The big coal-passer</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find a way, and the dog, now almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">full grown, was growing more precious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him each day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day as Engle passed, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated his warning, and Smith asked--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the next few days Engle outlined</seg><seg type="columnLine">a plan. The two could only speak a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">words as the prisoner passed forward for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his morning exercise, but at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">week Engle was gone. The master-at-arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">had locked him in, after giving him his sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per, and the marine sentry, coming on</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch at eight o'clock, had found the brig</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. The ship was searched from stem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stern, but the prisoner could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found, which was not surprising, since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam launch had made a regular trip at</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first lieutenant summoned Reasoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is a serious matter, Master-at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms.

Smith lacked the dog's</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom of manner. He came with hesita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, more timid than he had been for</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks. He had something on his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">which his new outlook on life would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit him to sit quiet under, and so in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own way he came to make amends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are talking about disrating you</seg><seg type="columnLine">because Engle got away," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Reasoner, stroking the dog's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've been a good friend to Arab and</seg><seg type="columnLine">me," said Smith, the words coming faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he went along.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">real explanation will show up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Smith was unhappy. A conscience</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had forgotten he owned nagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

"I tell you, Reasoner, you are too</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy on these fellows. It takes more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">being good to them to make sailormen. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to confer with the captain before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">act, but unless you can furnish some good</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation for Engle's walking out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brig, we'll probably disrate you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOBO SMITH had gone ashore</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a plan. Always a child of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, he thought that Engle might</seg><seg type="columnLine">providentially show up. Just what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do even then was not quite clear in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind. He was undergoing the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial of his life. Taught to five for himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, and to consider nothing worth while</seg><seg type="columnLine">that concerned others, his experience on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board the Dixie had almost made him over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was still in the transitory stage, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not emerged fully into his new life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His big purpose in coming ashore was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight out this battle with liimself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he walked along, Arab trotting so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berly at his heels, as if he understood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle his master was having, Smith fi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nally made a decision. Reasoner had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">too good to him. He would go back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">square things up and take the punishment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least Arab had been saved from Engle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knew that Reasoner would lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">good care of the dog until he was free again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The resolution made Smith start briskly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the landing. He had just time to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat and return on time. Arab sensing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the change in his master's spirits, ran ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him gayly. Suddenly he stopped, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bristles on his spine rose, and his jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned back from his rows of well-formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. He faced across the sidewalk, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there walking calmly down the other side</seg><seg type="columnLine">42</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in civilian clothes was Engle. Smith would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have passed him without recognition, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dog had picked out the hate smell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew his enemy in any garb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep back," Smith warned the dog,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then they turned to follow Engle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big coal-passer saw them and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a narrow alley before they had followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a block. Smith now had a plan. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow Engle until he could find a police-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and then have him arrested. He fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected the man to run from him. Back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the old days when he dodged and evaded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would have been his own course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Engle, seeing no help in sight, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to meet him, and Smith had a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of panic, tempted to take to his heels. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog saved him. Arab was the wrong breed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run from danger. He advanced, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of a battle, and Smith followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you want?" asked Engle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Call that dog off, and beat it about your</seg><seg type="columnLine">business or I'll kick both your ribs in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're going back to the ship with us,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Smith, trying to put a little of the brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace of Arab's growls into his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well of all the nerve!" laughed Engle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Scat, the two of you, before my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Arab had charged. Engle's tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the wave of his hand had been challenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. Straight for the throat he leaped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tawny streak of fury. Engle struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with both hands, dodging sideways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the dog missed. One of the coal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passer's big fists struck him in the side as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he passed in the air, and hurled him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pavement. The shock almost knocked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath out of him, and for a few moments he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay partly stunned. Engle ran toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to finish what he had started, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kick from one of his heavy shoes, but an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and weightier antagonist had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hobo Smith had jumped to the rescue of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dog, and was on Engle's back raining</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloWs on his head. Engle forgot the dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time, and lunging backward tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break the smaller man's hold by strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his body against the wall. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted, but held on, remembering that</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his dog had hit the pavement he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even whimpered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll get you," panted Engle. "I'll kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But with the threat there came to Hobo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith that perfect thing which Reasoner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had first given him a glimpse of, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Arab had further instructed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which all day and during the weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">past he had been striving for. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made over. Something warm and new</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooded his soul, driving out all cowardice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">timidity, fear. He was a man. A resolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose guided his blows. He began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think in the cool terms of a grim determina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of Engle's straining hands let go in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its backward search for Smith's throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arab was up and charging again. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the dog came on a little more warily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As Engle kicked, he circled and dodged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching for a chance. His adversary was</seg><seg type="columnLine">handicapped with Smith on his back. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">as savagely as a springing wolf, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found an opening, leaped and drawn blood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was away before Engle could avenge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith had squirmed away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's grip, when Arab made his attack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and before Engle could recover had struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him two blows in the face. Engle staggered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ripping jaws of the dog had torn a gash</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his right arm, and one of Smith's</seg><seg type="columnLine">unscientific blows had reached the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaw. Half-blinded, he could not dodge</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the dog drove in again, and this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the hungry jaws at his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take him off!" Engle bellowed, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled backward to the pavement under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weight of a third blow from Smith, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impact of the dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lie still then," ordered Smith, and pried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arab away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Engle's collar and tie had saved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat from serious damage. A policeman</seg><seg type="columnLine">came running down the alley. At its upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">end a crowd had collected to see what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An escaped prisoner in civilian clothes,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained Smith. "I tried to arrest him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he resisted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke with confidence, sure of him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Arab stood between his knees, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the fallen Engle, ready to do battle on</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant, if his master's knees relaxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their light pressure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," said the officer. "I'll go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to the ship with you to make sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks," said Hobo Smith, and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Engle. "Get up," he commanded, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bigger man obeyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hobo Smith and Arab with the hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuffed Engle and the policeman missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one boat. When they reported on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arab</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">board the officer of the deck called the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieutenant. Smith stood aside, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog resting on the deck by him, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">policeman told the story of Engle's cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, and the coal-passer was sent forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a marine guard to have his wounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed before going into the brig. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the policeman was dismissed, and the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieutenant turned to Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Smith," he said, "you've made</seg><seg type="columnLine">good after all. You and that stray pup of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours. What can I do for you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith hesitated. Making a decision was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing, living up to it another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Step over here where we'll be alone,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested the officer, making a wrong guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his reluctance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to give myself up," said Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. "I let Engle out. I stole Reason-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er's key and made a duplicate. Engle</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped out of the brig when the marine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the other end of the beat. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arab down there and the marine stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment to pat him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What for?" demanded the amazed first</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieutenant. "What did you do that for?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Didn't Engle try to make fish-bait out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your dog?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Smith told the whole miser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able story of Engle's threat, his love for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dog, and his fear that Engle would harm</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arab. Then of Reasoner's trouble over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the escaped prisoner, his decision while</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore to tell the truth to save his friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally a request that Reasoner have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dog while he was being punished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first lieutenant was a man of wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience in the handling of men, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this problem puzzled him. While he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, he asked questions. Smith must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be punished, of course, but how, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's new-found spirit would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">strengthened and not broken?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you are doing this to save Reasoner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who has been good to you? The captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I had decided to disrate him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes sir," answered Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about Engle? This fireman that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he struck is much better. I may have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">restore him to duty if he behaves himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after he has had a chance to think it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few months."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Arab and me can handle him," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith, with a glance at the dog, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumped his tail against the deck when his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name was called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," said the first lieutenant, "be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause you wished to get Reasoner out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble and because you are no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of Engle, you are making this con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fession. Is there another reason?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes sir," said Smith. "I want to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over clean, and I couldn't bear to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">this thing haunting me. Besides," he fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, awkwardly, "Arab's a gentleman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he's got sense. He might find it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first lieutenant made up his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go forward," he said, "and tell Rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soner to put you and Arab in the brig for</seg><seg type="columnLine">three days' solitary confinement. You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have bread and water, and the dog a</seg><seg type="columnLine">full ration."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, sir," said Smith and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Salute," he ordered Arab.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dog promptly sat up and raised a</seg><seg type="columnLine">forepaw to his nose.

The falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">off is most serious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My conclusion is that the stock must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving Billups via the C. &amp; M. R. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggest that you personally go into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter and see what can be done to recover</seg><seg type="columnLine">this lost business for our line."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burford knew just what Yorke actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant when he said "I suggest;" it was sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply the general manager's polite way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying "I command." And Yorke, Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford was aware, expected him to make good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The superintendent leaned back in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair in a quandary. The loss of the stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">business out of Billups was a thing that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been disturbing him not a little. Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last twelve months he had had no less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than five different agents there with a view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reclaiming the cattle shipments that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become diverted to the C. &amp; M. R. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">all to no purpose. Michie, the agent there</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, he knew would never accomplish</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">anything; Michie was too mild. But where</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find another man, Burford didn't know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet - that, obviously, was what he must do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burford's mind ran over his fist of agents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One after another he mentally rejected--</seg><seg type="columnLine">some because not available, due to being</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied up at important posts, others because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lack of ability or because of some pecu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liarity of temperament. He traveled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fine until he came to Star City station;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he considered Joseph Reilly, agent there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too young," decided the superintendent</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a little cogitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went on down the list.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet, after he had gone dejectedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">over all his men and had about reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion that among them there was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one whom he should have, his thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to the too-young agent at Star</seg><seg type="columnLine">City.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Deuce take it, he's the best available</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of the lot!" growled Burford finally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting up. "The thing is this: I've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get somebody at Billups in Michie's place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reilly looks to me like the best bet. What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the answer? The answer is, send Reilly!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at his watch, then reached for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">H</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YOUR ordinary agent seldom is</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly pleased to see his superin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendent coming. It usually means</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble for somebody--and of course this</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody invariably is the agent. But in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joseph Reilly's young life a superintendent</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less was neither here nor there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Better Mixer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Young Joe greeted Superintendent Burford</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily and with no undue fluttering within</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breast when that official descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the early afternoon train at Star City.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How are things?" asked Burford.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Everything is tip-top," answered Joe;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"business booming and all that. I oughtn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kick." He smiled a bit. "But that's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. When everything is going good I</seg><seg type="columnLine">get restless."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come in the office," said Burford.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps I can help you some."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They entered the station and within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office the superintendent took the agent's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. Joe found himself another chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed it near Burford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "WTould you like to move?" began the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superintendent abruptly as soon as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were seated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Moving is one of the best things I do,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Joe. He nodded. "Yes, sure. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">and where?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the superintendent expected a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more obsequiousness, he never betrayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact. Rather, he seemed to find some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to relish in the easy assurance of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent. Burford's eyes took on a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tomorrow," he answered. "And to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billups."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll pack my tooth-brush and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt tonight," smiled Joe. "I've never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been to Billups, but I hear it's a real live</seg><seg type="columnLine">town."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's live enough," assured Burford.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And we need a real live man there. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think you might qualify?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe smiled more widely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm much too modest-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hang your modesty!" laughed Burford.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're no dead one--and I know that!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right, have it your own way; I'm the</seg><seg type="columnLine">live man for the live town. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then as follows." The superin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendent's face became more serious. "In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first place," he began, "we've lost a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of business out of Billups. A year ago we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were handling two stock trains a week out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of there, bound for South Omaha. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">just now we're lucky if we get one in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">month. The C. &amp; M. R. also goes through</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billups, you know--and they've taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically all the cattle business away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us. It's to get back to our old footing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we're aiming at.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our trouble started over a claim that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a stockman named Mohr had entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">against us. Our claim department re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused to settle for the amount he declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should have. He got sore, spread his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grievance among his fellow-cattlemen, gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">us a bad name, and they all flocked over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the C. &amp; M. R. And there they've stuck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our service is better than the C. &amp; M.</seg><seg type="columnLine">R's.--always has been. And it has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty well established, since, that Mohr,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who put in the trouble-making</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim, was trying to hold us up. But nei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther our better service nor the establishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mohr's unjust demands has seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help us. The shippers continue to stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our competitor, the C. &amp; M. R."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why?" asked Joe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been paying strict attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burford's words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the whole thing," said Burford,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"the answer to that why. It's this: the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">C.	&amp; M. R. has an agent up there named</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike. Mr. McPike is the villain. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">holds 'em--the shippers, I mean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How?" asked Joe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By personality, as near as I can find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out," replied Burford. "He's one great</seg><seg type="columnLine">little old mixer, Mr. McPike; and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how the average cattleman likes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good mixer. He surely does hold the boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to his knitting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I foresee," said Joe enthusiastically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that an interesting time will be had by one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all. I'm just dying to meet friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike. He appeals to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's no fool, as you can guess," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burford. "You'll find you've got a sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough job on your hands, trying to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of those boys to come back to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">D.	&amp; P. I'll confess I don't know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll do it. I'll not give you any instruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. You just go about it in your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks," said Joe. "If there's one</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiling I've a fondness for it's orders like 'Go</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it in your own way.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another thing," said Burford. "In be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a good mixer this man McPike often</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly bends the rules. What I mean is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he may sometimes take a drink, or indulge</seg><seg type="columnLine">in cards or be away from his depot without</seg><seg type="columnLine">permission. The C. &amp; M. R. I know is</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of this: but they only wink at it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burford glanced shrewdly at Reilly. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have to do a little winking ourselves."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Reilly never batted an eye-lid. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned Burford's gaze steadily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," was all he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Understand," said the superintendent</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, "I'm trusting to your discretion."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm no saint," assured Joe, "but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know where to stop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was chuckling, inwardly, in apprecia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of Burford's predicament. The super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">intendent did not want to seem to encourage</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to break any of the rules, and yet, if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">became necessary, neither did he want Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be too prudish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can trust me in that," added Joe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I believe I understand just what you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm glad of that," said Burford with</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief. "If there were to be any actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong, I wouldn't want you to do it. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little reluctant, anyhow. But we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been sending agent after agent up there to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billups and not one has been able to do any</seg><seg type="columnLine">good. So I'm getting desperate. If we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can once get our old business back I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can hold it. Your job will be to get it</seg><seg type="columnLine">started back. We'll do the rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused and looked earnestly at Reilly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm counting on you to be the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixer," he said. "Is it a go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a go!" said Joseph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BILLUPS lies in the narrow, south</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of a mighty V-shaped valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To the north and northwest stretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broadening ranges whence come the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattlemen with their droves, seeking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlet to the markets. This outlet is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billups, with its two rival railroads--the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">D.	&amp; P. and the C. &amp; M. R. The D. &amp; P.</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirts the eastern end of Jhe town, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">C.	&amp; M.

"It's my opinion that he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bad one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why so?" asked Joseph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe he tells things to McPike.

R. I believe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk kept his eye on all my car orders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would tip McPike off as to what was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Doubtless McPike handed him some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for the information."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Emmhl Sounds interesting," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reilly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The train pulled away from the water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plug and came up to the platform.

"I'll keep in mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you've told me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good luck!" called Michie and climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Consequently, that afternoon Reilly had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a conference with his office force, one Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowdall; the office force was operator,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk and all-'round handy man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've been here with the D. &amp; P. how</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, Jacky?" asked Joe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, about a year," stated the clerk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Know all the folks about town?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most of 'em.

Reilly, unobserved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed the clerk sharply. From the first the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new agent had not been greatly impressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his office force. Dowdall was a fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">telegrapher--and that about let him out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, the revelation of the force's former</seg><seg type="columnLine">connection with McPike on the C. &amp; M.

"Why couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">they haul in some business for the D. &amp; P.?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowdall smiled patronizingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Poor fish, all of 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you mean, poor fish?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Better Mixer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No brains, no nerve." The clerk gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little laugh, as if the thoughts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deficiencies of the numerous ex-agents in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some way was not unpleasant. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike is a regular hum-dinger. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">just tell them boys to head in; and wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, that's where they headed ini"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Had 'em buffaloed, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clerk laughed aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, he guessed every move them poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish planned to make and he headed 'em off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what do you think about me?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Any use to try and buck him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jacky smiled again. It was a gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, but the gentleness of it was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in the patronizing superiority of it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">something pitying was in it, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll tell you," condescended the clerk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No; not a bit of use. You haven't got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're wrong, Jacky!" Joe's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly became sharp and short. "Wrong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say. Get your hat and coat!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" asked Dowdall, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildly surprised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get your hat and coat!" ordered Joe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Two articles, there on a nail behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clerk did as ordered. The curtness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the new agent's words appeared to sink</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his brain; he looked uneasy as Reilly</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the office door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get out!" said Joe shortly.

Perhaps he'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasty; but he thought not.

Burford:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My clerk has left. Please send another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">J. Reilly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time he had gotten the message</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, some fifteen minutes had passed since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time of Dowdall's departure. Joe con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered what to do next. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite plan of campaign mapped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for a few moments he sat in a silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">study trying to think of some place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start or some method to follow. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a vigorous method, he decided. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a Tvhimsical idea came to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe I'll go over and see McPike!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he suddenly exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The more he thought of it the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whimsy pleased him. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">trains coming for at least an hour or so;</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore he could lock up the depot for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Jing, yes!" he ejaculated, springing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet. "There's nothing like getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquainted with a man, especially if you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for a chance to kick him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shins!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEING what is known as a weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel, Jack Dowdall's actions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">often governed by, and his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was susceptible to, the suggestion of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger will. Hence it perhaps was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange that after leaving the D. &amp; P.</seg><seg type="columnLine">depot he decided to go and see McPike--</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Reilly had suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dowdall proceeded quickly across town</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the station of the C. &amp; M. R. Agent</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike sat alone in his office when Dowdall</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Jack!" greeted McPike. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceiving the sullen expression on Dow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dall's face. "What's bothering you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plenty!" replied Jack. He glared into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shrewd face of the C. &amp; M. R. agent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The D. &amp; P. has got another new agent;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the first thing the blasted fool did was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tie the can on me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agent McPike settled comfortably back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his chair, the chair groaning in protest</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he did so. The C. &amp; M. R. agent was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big man, tall and thick. There were fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrinldes around his eyes, as there are apt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be around the eyes of men who laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. Most folks noticed this; but some</seg><seg type="columnLine">folks noticed more the thin, almost cruel</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips of the man, set close together, hard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So they've got another one," observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike. That seemed to be the news that</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested him most. "Who is he; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what kind of a guy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take it from me," returned Dowdall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"he's a real wide-awake guy!" He fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gaze determinedly on McPike. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's not why I came--just to tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. I want to know what you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">do to get me on the C. &amp; M. R. again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wrinkles around McPike's eyes did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not contract, but his mouth opened about</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eighth of an inch in a thin-lipped grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't take you on here, Jack," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied complacently. "I've got a helper;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one's my limit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, how about some other station</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the line?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McPike shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--no place I know of. I understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody is full up. What's this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">guy's name?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, you can't put me off that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way!" cried Dowdall peevishly. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get me on if you wanted. Look what</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I did for you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep your shirt on!" returned McPike</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily. "I guess you didn't lose anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">on me." He regarded Dowdall with cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrogant eyes. "You might have been of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some use to me over on the D. &amp; P.; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now you're not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you won't help me any?" de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded Dowdall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too bad, but I can't do a thing," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike suavely, once more exhibiting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment a patron came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open office window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come out and look at this case of coffee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mac!" he called in to the agent. "It's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed to the devil!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," answered McPike, "I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">right along." He rose and went out toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the freight-house, leaving the fuming Dow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dall alone in the office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The telegraph instruments, lined up along</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the desk at the front of the office, clicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">persistently in Dowdall's ears as he wrath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully reflected over McPike's treatment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had expected something better of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">C.	&amp; M. R. agent--at least a little assist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance in securing another job. But this</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm rebuff, this calm ignoring of all claims,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought home to the ex-clerk the fact that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being no longer in a position to furnish</seg><seg type="columnLine">information as to the activities of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">D.	&amp; P. agent, McPike cared nothing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to where he drifted. The ex-clerk was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with vindictive thoughts--as usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the case of the person who finds himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a similar plight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The telegraph instruments kept clattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in Dowdall's ears. Being a teleg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapher himself and having at one time</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked in this office, he was familiar with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the calls, and had, as well, a knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the business routine. He heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">division office calling some other office down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Desire for vengeance crept into Dowdall's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. If he only could get back at McPike I</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike really was responsible for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">having lost the job on the D. &amp; P., the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ex-clerk told himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A plan suddenly jumped into DowdalPs</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain. He sat up straight, then got to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and walked over quickly to the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">that faced the freight-house and peered out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike was not in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bold, bad scheme formed swiftly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowdall's head. Tomorrow, Saturday, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew was the day when the big cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipments were made from Billups, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock-cars always being forwarded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the division terminal yards Friday night</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time to arrive at Billups early Saturday</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dowdall glanced again out the window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still no McPike. Doubtless the agent</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be absent a few .minutes more, going</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the damaged case of coffee, and check-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up the loss. The division office was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still calling; there would be time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ex-clerk opened the key on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">division office wire, a mischief-making</seg><seg type="columnLine">message already formed in his brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE C. &amp; M. R. station seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted when Joe Reilly arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. He entered through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear door of the waiting-room and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the open ticket window. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">beheld but one man within the office and</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Better Mixer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he smiled a little as he perceived that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his late clerk, Dowdall. The late</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk's back was toward the ticket window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently he had not heard Reilly's</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance, for he did not turn his head or</seg><seg type="columnLine">make any other sign to disclose that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was conscious of the D. &amp; P. agent's</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reilly saw Dowdall peer quickly out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front office window. There was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely furtive about the quick glance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something sly in the very poise of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk's head. Joe watched him silently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">noting the vindictive lines of Dowdall's</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-averted face, also the working of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasy fingers. And then, when the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk all at once opened the telegraph key,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sudden resolution showing in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crafty countenance, Joe strained his ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear what the sounder spelled as Dowdall</seg><seg type="columnLine">started a message.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The message came to an end and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator at the other end gave his OK.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowdall straightened up, his face a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed, his eyes glittering triumphantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There, - your hide, McPike!" he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ejaculated guardedly--but not guardedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to prevent the words from reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Reilly's ears. "I guess maybe that'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">fix your clock--for a little bit, anyway!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Reilly instantly and noiselessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped out of the station. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehend all that had taken place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the C. &amp; M. R. office, but he did compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hend enough to give him a pretty shrewd</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of it. He decided, swiftly, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of his personal acquaintance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike could wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "McPike has turned Jacky down," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected Joe, his brain. working at high</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, "and Jacky thinks he sees a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to play the devil!" Joe suppressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grin as a subtle plan suddenly began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfold before him. "All's fair in love and</seg><seg type="columnLine">business!" he commented silently. "So</seg><seg type="columnLine">why not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently there was no answer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">why not, for he immediately legged it back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the D. &amp; P. station. He entered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">office and from there sent another message.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The message was as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Supt. Burpord:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Send me sixty or seventy stock-cars. Get them</seg><seg type="columnLine">here quick--before tomorrow noon if at all possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">J. Reilly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the message had gone Reilly busied</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> himself around the office. At 5:30 the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southbound limited arrived. And just as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to pull out Joe was not greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised to behold his erstwhile clerk come</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaking across the station platform and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile on to one of the coaches, suitcase in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jacky, it seems, is leaving for parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown," said Joe. "He's wise in that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And to show that he harbored no hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelings he waved his hand at the departing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jacky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT A square table in a comer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Oasis saloon the agent of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">C.	&amp; M.

The Oasis</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well filled with patrons, the patrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">being for the greater part cattle-owners,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived early for the morrow's loading.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cattle-owner's herds would follow;</seg><seg type="columnLine">meantime they, the cattlemen, set them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves to a little recreation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tell you, Mac," said the drooping-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustached man, "the boys are getting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bit restless.

"We can</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you be too sure," said Mohr</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly. "I heard them grumbling a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">over that extra feed bill.

He promised the next bunch'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be handled quicker.

What kind of a hombre is this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reilly?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Young chap." McPike smiled con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidently. "You just leave it to me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doors at the front of the saloon swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">open and two men entered: Joseph Reilly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a shining-faced, heavy-set man. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rather boisterous entrance that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two made. Rather, it was a somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">boisterous entrance that the shining-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">man made; his voice could be heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiastically urging Reilly to come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and meet the boys--all good friends of his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside the doorway Joe Reilly stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The eyes of nearly all the patrons had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward the doorway, attracted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the commotion there. Joe laid his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly on his conductor's shoulder and cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">a calm glance around the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Does this man belong to any of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was silence for a few seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the assembled cattlemen. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there a little chuckle broke out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know's he belongs to any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">in particular," offered a grizzled old cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, standing nearby. He eyed Joe with</seg><seg type="columnLine">approval. "But if he does belong to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, I reckon it'd be McPike."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "McPike?" repeated Joe. "Where is</seg><seg type="columnLine">he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old cowman pointed a finger to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table in the corner where the C. &amp; M.

Reilly caught his late conductor by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and speedily led him over to the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "McPike," said Joe abruptly, "here I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am! This toady of yours tried to draw me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in here. Mr. Toady, report to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden silence had fallen in the saloon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men turned more attentively to the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the comer. Those who held glasses aloft</seg><seg type="columnLine">set them softly down on the bar. Joe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Reilly was a stranger to all of them. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they sensed that something interesting was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The toady stood without words, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Reilly to McPike. He moistened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips once or twice, but no sound came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't?" said Joe shortly. "Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, I'll speak myself." He looked at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">C.	&amp; M. R. agent. "Your friend didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool me even a little bit, McPike; he's too</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsy. It didn't take me a whole lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a minute to guess that for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason other than mere friendliness he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to get me in this place; and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed, too, that the reason was you. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, here I am. What do you want?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McPike raised his big bulk to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He couldn't keep the astonishment out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes. Things were not going exactly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had planned. He suddenly realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was going to have a hard time making</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fool of this man in front of the cattlemen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The D. &amp; P.'s new agent was too aggressive;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he carried things, so to speak, right into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy's country. But McPike resolved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make an effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got a great imagination, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy!" he boomed, trying to throw a good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natured note in with his patronizing air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wrinkled his eyes to show his merriment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And what would I be wanting with you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drew himself to his full height. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if his thought was intimidation, his thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">availed him nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe Reilly looked at him with level eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I just believe I'll tell you," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I believe that'd be a right good plan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bent forward slightly and fixed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes on the C. &amp; M. R. agent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wanted this, McPike!" said Joe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his words coming with calm assurance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You wanted to get me in here and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after revealing to these men who I am,</seg><seg type="columnLine">make me act the clown while you snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whip. I've heard of your methods with</seg><seg type="columnLine">other agents the D. &amp; P. has sent here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe looked around for a brief instant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interested stockmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen," he said, "I'll introduce</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself.

And then, as before, it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grizzled cowman who spoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Better Mixer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're pleased to meet you!" said the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man; his eyes twinkled and there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">subdued gurgling in his throat. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">name's Man tooth--'Old Sam' Mantooth."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Reilly turned a swift grin on him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then swung back to the C. &amp; M. R.</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "McPike," he said evenly, "you can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it. You can't make me do anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm telling you, big fellow. If you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise, go to it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wrinkles had disappeared from</seg><seg type="columnLine">around McPike's eyes. The hard lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his thin-lipped mouth stood out; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull, angry red had come into his face; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes flamed with rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You young fool!" he roared. "You will</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to bluff me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took a quick step around the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table and made a lunge at Joe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Starting from the hip, Joe drove his fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward. There was a sudden solid smack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and McPike returned toward the same spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had just left. But, returning, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not travel on his feet; the only thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did travel on was air. And when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived it was on his back, whereon he laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, half-dazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bless my soul!" came from Old Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mantooth. "The immortal Bob F. was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right! The bigger they are the harder</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fall!" He raised his voice. "Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reilly, I'd be much pleased if you'd teach</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe smiled broadly at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Call around at my office any day!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">invited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked down at the blinking McPike.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're in a draft there, Maccy," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said pleasantly. "Get up or you'll catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold. Then I'll tell you something else."</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face betraying his embarrassment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike scrambled to his feet and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Joe sourly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Before I say the something else," pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded Joe, "I'll give you a chance. Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you any observations to make, further?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike swallowed hard. Murder glared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes--hate at being made to appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">so helpless before the cattlemen. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables had been reversed, exactly, from what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had planned. But swallow was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike did; he ventured no word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, never mind," soothed Joe. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I was going to say was this: I'd like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lay a little wager with you that between</seg><seg type="columnLine">this and Sunday I'll have at least seventy-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">five per cent, of the cattle moving out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billups traveling over the D. &amp; P. What</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that McPike seemed to find his tongue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of the arrogance came back into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you do," he cried, "may I be damned!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's no smart Aleck going to come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and show off and then do anything like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nevertheless," returned Joe evenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm offering to lay the bet. They tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me you're quite a sporting man. Will you</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept a wager on that? And if so, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">will you stake on it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Accept it!" he shouted. "Well I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes! And I'll tell you what I'll stake--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll stake my job against yours! If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose, you quit! If I lose, I quit!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glared with sudden triumph at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reilly. The D. &amp; P. agent had played</seg><seg type="columnLine">right into his hand. This was a good way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get rid of a man who in time might prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dangerous competitor for the cattlemen's</seg><seg type="columnLine">patronage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the one day that came before Sunday</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, comparatively, a short time. McPike</seg><seg type="columnLine">was confident he could hold the stockmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the C. &amp; M. R. for that long despite his</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent sorry showing. And if the D. &amp; P.</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent backed down now Reilly would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever branded as no good sport, as dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing a yellow streak. McPike felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had Reilly, coming and going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe Reilly merely swung 'round to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed cattlemen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've heard the conditions," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them. "The bet's on!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BILLUPS buzzed on Saturday</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning with talk of Friday night's</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair in the Oasis. Naturally, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattlemen had not been backward in giving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the details. Billups received the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">with relish and then took to discussing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter at great length. And the final,</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically unanimous verdict was that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while they admired Reilly's nerve and</seg><seg type="columnLine">acclaimed his skill, they nevertheless were</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced that he had overdone himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the matter of the wager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After making such a showy beginning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why should any man go and lay himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">open to such an anti-climax, asked Billups.</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike, it was decided, had shown great</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">astuteness in drawing the terms of the bet;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was felt that in this he had regained much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the prestige he had temporarily lost in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first part of the Oasis episode. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike could hold the shippers to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">C.	&amp; M.

McPike stared, batted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, then hurried into the office. He pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">tie plugs from the switchboard, sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his message wire key and swiftly began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call the division office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment or two the division office</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered and McPike dashed off a message</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his superintendent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Surf.

He thrust his head forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrathfully.

"And when I received the letter I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at first a little surprised; because</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dowdall has no cause to love me, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidering that I gave him the bounce yes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terday. But I've doped out since that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote it through pure vanity. You see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wouldn't have enjoyed his revenge real</seg><seg type="columnLine">good unless he was certain that you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">McPike, would find out it was he who'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">gummed things up for you. He wanted all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the credit for himself--wanted to show you</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he put it over you; and he figured that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd be coming to see me and that I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">show you the letter. And I'll say this for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, that he figured it out pretty straight."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a minute's silence.

Joe turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly grin directly on McPike. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, I thought I'd just go over and get</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquainted with you; and when I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into your station, there was Dowdall, alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your office, sending the message. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be blasted!" cried McPike.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">all looked up the track toward it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines--for it proved to be a double-</seg><seg type="columnLine">header--swung around a long curve and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in sight; and after the engines came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long string of empty stock-cars. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines drifted down to the stock-yard sid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and stopped. A brakeman jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, threw the switch and gave a signal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe turned to face the cattlemen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And in the meantime," he said, "if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys are having any trouble getting your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stock out, why, here're lots of cars. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be pleased to help, if you can use 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cattlemen had been regarding Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a rather puzzled sort of way. But at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his words their faces cleared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You son of a gun!" exclaimed Scherr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Use 'em?

His ever-ready smile again</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke out.

Somehow, perhaps as the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to my nostrils, things came to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind out there. The sun was warm, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers were bright and carpeted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, the birds sang in the trees, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winds faintly rustled the leaves.

Then suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Sir William was about to gain sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">control to voice his rage, the young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst into a low laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There!

At his first movement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first parting of his lips, Dick's hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out. One grasped his excellency's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, the other closed his mouth and bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">back his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a move, or your own breast shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheath your dagger," whispered the laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Dick. "Not a sound, for sounds do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not now accord with my plan. We have *</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked, and to no purpose. You offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a noose or a place to suckle at the breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the royal sow. Do you remember the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagle an Indian brought to the tavern a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few years ago and which hung in a cage at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door? You asked me to become as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that eagle, asked me, who have known</seg><seg type="columnLine">the free air of a free land, to submit to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">king's fetters. And do you remember how</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day that eagle grasped the hand of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawer at the tavern when the cage door</seg><seg type="columnLine">was open and how he fought his way out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even now your own hand is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagle's grip.

I knew you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have me here again tonight, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that thereby you would give me my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir William Berkeley's face became</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple under the pressure. The grip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick's fingers was like that of a smith's</seg><seg type="columnLine">vise, but now it suddenly loosened and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped from his waist a long sash which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not worn in the afternoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I will leave this with your excellency as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">memento," he said as he loosened his other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and drew the sash across Sir William's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and tied it. "I got it from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">French last year. You see it is long, long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to bind your excellency's arms as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as his mouth. There! Now for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. This cord from the draperies seems</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">destined to meet my needs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped to the floor and in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment had securely fastened the feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the half-conscious governor to his chair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he straightened -up and surveyed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work his eyes clouded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I require time," he said thoughtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It might be that you will be able to utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sound before I have passed beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">your reach.

The work com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted to his satisfaction, he bent over so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his lips were close to the governor's ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If your Excellency wishes me, I will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the South Sea," he whispered. "Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the king's own will surely be brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to seek me there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed again and patted the shrouded</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks, many thanks, for an enjoyable</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening," he said. "I only regret that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not possible for me to laugh aloud."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked across to the window, opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and sprang out. Crouching, keeping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadows, he made his way to the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick Jeffreys had not planned heedlessly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the afternoon he had seen Indians on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets of Jamestown, Indians who, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, had come by water.

His way led through scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">patches of scrub oak, sometimes hardly high</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to afford shelter, and across blister-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bare spots where no plant could find</seg><seg type="columnLine">nourishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's worse than the sands along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore of Virginia and the Carolinas," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">panted.

These precautions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">second nature, as automatic and as neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to his continued existence as his res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piration and the beating of his heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Consciously, however, he had not seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening ahead, the sudden termination</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the scrub oak and other small growth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he found himself at the base of a hill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. It rolled upward gently, its surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrinkled by waves like those on a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lake beneath a gentle breeze.

From its crest he found a higher hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sand beyond, and all about him the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat down in scorching fury, while from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground a heat almost as intense arose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the second hill there was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be seen except an ocean of rolling sand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, hill after hill, valley after valley, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all bare as water itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll have one more look from that next</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill," thought Dick aloud. "It's higher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it may be that I can see to the end of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If not, I'll turn back.

He believed he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a land where the savages were friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the only white men they knew, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">French, and if he did encounter one he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtain some information as to the rendez-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vous of the traders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though Dick walked steadily all after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon he failed to find any traces of savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">or French. He did come to the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand but only to find a low, swampy country</seg><seg type="columnLine">with great stretches of coarse grass, willows</seg><seg type="columnLine">bordering the shore and the whole apparent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly as lifeless as the dry desert he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed. At sunset he reached what ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be a small island in the swamp, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher bit of ground with elms and oaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it and, best of all, a mother grouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a flock seeking a nesting-place for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night in the branches of an oak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick waited patiently until dusk and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung himself up and began to whack at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid birds with a light stick. He knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down six of the eight and was assured of</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper and breakfast. When the sun came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the sea in the morning he was ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the day's march, and so certain was he</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had reached the land of the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">and friendly savages he started along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore with a light heart and lips parted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">song.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His course had been bending more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more until by mid-forenoon he was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost straight north. The low, swampy</seg><seg type="columnLine">country continued, but farther up the coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the beginning of higher ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond that high bluffs that rose from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. At noon, while still in the marsh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">further progress was arrested by a river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was too deep to ford, and there was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at hand with which to build a raft to</seg><seg type="columnLine">float across his few possessions. While he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there, undecided as to his course, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">birchbark canoe swept around the bend</seg><seg type="columnLine">above him. In it were three white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A smile of contentment 011 his face, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of his four hazardous months had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, Dick stood leaning on his musket,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting the strangers. That they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchmen he did not doubt. Men of no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other race had ever penetrated so far to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward. Even at that distance he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguish their gray homespun clothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bright sashes without which no coureurs</seg><seg type="columnLine">de bois ever went into the wilderness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their peculiar "pudding-bag" caps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That they would be friendly Dick was</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally confident. Most of them, he knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were outlaws like himself, men who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">preceded even the Jesuits into the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">places along the shores of the Great Lakes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who traded with the savages'without</seg><seg type="columnLine">that necessary permit from the king of</seg><seg type="columnLine">France. Recognizing no superiors, no laws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no right save that of might and their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclinations, daring the unknown wilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and the equally unknown temper of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage inhabitants, their lives in tune with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild rapids of the rivers, the fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">storms of the lakes and the fiercer natures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the natives, they appeared to Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeffreys in all the romantic coloring with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which his imagination had clothed them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He need only tell them, he knew, that he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, was an outlaw, a fugitive from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrath and stifling influence of kings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would accept him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he stood there the canoe came straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the center of the river. The three</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had seen him as quickly as he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, but had not missed a stroke of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddles, nor had they in any way indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they considered his presence unac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they were fifty paces away Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his right hand and called--"Bon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jour.}&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bon jour, bon jour," came a friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer from the men in the bow and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stern paddler remained silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick's mother had received a good educa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in England before she had married</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Jeffreys and sailed for Virginia.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the tilings she had insisted upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick learning in his early boyhood was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">French language, and his year in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">France had served to perfect him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait, comrades," he called.

We still</seg><seg type="columnLine">have far to go and are in need of a strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and another paddle. Another musket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, for that matter.

"Get in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Basile remained silent, though there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ugly look on his face. Dick glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, smiled good-naturedly, and stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They did not speak as they shot down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river under the impetus of four paddles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick knew that here was his first opportu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nity to prove himself, and his spruce blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent with the force of his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enough!" cried Basile at last, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a swirl of water they brought up at a stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating at the mouth of the river. The net</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quickly overhauled and two score of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish taken. Then, their paddles snapping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">briskly, they turned up-stream. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the forepart of the canoe broke into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a voyageurs' song, obscene and blasphe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous but with an air that quickened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle strokes and seemed of its own buoy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancy to lift the light craft from the water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick's body tingled with the thrill of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed to its rhythm, and when they broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the chorus the second time he joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">them joyously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Silence!" whispered Basile fiercely as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rounded a bend. "There's some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the cabine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quietly now, but as swiftly, they went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the low, marshy banks. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">bend and they saw the river fork. On a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of high ground between the two streams</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white tent gleamed against the willows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gliding in and out of the door, shrieking as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they bore casks and bales of goods down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their waiting canoes, were a dozen savages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those thieving Miamis!" cried Basile</seg><seg type="columnLine">"At them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PADDLING fiercely, swearing con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuously, searing oaths which Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never heard before, the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">coureurs de bois shot their craft straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Indians. Dick, silent but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping heart at this chance of a fray, bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back as effectively as the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The canoe did not slacken speed as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached the bank. One of the savages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the act of shakily lifting a gourd to his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the white men and shrieked a warning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same instant the canoe struck and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupants, rising to their feet with the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke, landed with an impetus that carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, muskets swinging about their heads,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the door of the tent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The savages had taken advantage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour's absence of the Frenchmen and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though their brains were inflamed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid fire they had consumed, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not able to convert their blood-thirsty de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sires into action. They swayed and tot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered as they gathered to meet the attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">and half of them went down in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush. Three of these were on their feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly, however, and when the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men faced about in front of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent they were met by a compact group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming brown bodies, flashing knives</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swinging hatchets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick, his musket whirling like a flail, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wait for the attack but sprang forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an answering yell. Two savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">went down before him, but the impetus of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy weapon carried him into the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the group, and a knife slit open his buckskin</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt and gashed his shoulder. Still he kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">his musket swinging, with the result that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the group was divided and the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchmen, charging together, swept one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">half before them into the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back they came to join Dick, who faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remainder. The savages wavered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then broke for their canoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get the goods!" cried Basile as he dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">after them. "Unload the canoes first!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They pursued the fleeing party so closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no time for embarking, and as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians did not return to the attack, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men unloaded the canoes and piled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the casks and bales of goods upon the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime the five savages who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been forced into the river had struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to shore, all the fight gone out of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They held up their hands in token of sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">render and Basile nodded toward the ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noes. The men filed past, lifted their craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water and stepped in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Basile began to speak quickly, sharply,</seg><seg type="columnLine">In Miami, a tongue not unlike some Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known to the east. The Indians who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had retreated up the river bank returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deposited their weapons in the canoes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The six of them filed past the tent to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of their comrades lay upon the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without examining the bodies to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether life had fled, they carried them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoes and dropped them in. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next moment their three barks were shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh, Basile?" cried one of the French-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men joyously. "What do you think now?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is he not one of us? Oh, that was-a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge he made, straight through the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. Come! Shake his hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick had recognized in Basile the leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trio, and from the first the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dislike had been evident. As he faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">him now, flushed from his exertions and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words of the Frenchman, he saw no</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessening in hostility. Rather it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be increased, though now only Basile's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes gave expression to his feeling. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's evil face even broke into a forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile as he held out his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fought well and showed your</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage," he said to Dick as he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to meet him. "I hold no objection</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your being one of us, after we have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to hear your story. It is a strange</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, an Englishman so far from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">colony. None has ever been here before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But no doubt you can explain it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His tone was almost gracious, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick looked into his eyes he saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words were empty, that he need not seek</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Leon!

Dick</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laughed outright and bowed to the French-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have no anxiety, monsieur," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I harbor no ambitions, no aspirations ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept to enjoy life as I find it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "See that you have no others," growled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Basile as he turned away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">"one of us"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick Jeffreys was left alone with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile when Leon and Michel went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the Chicagon River to the lake to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover their net. The Frenchman.was busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">examining and arranging the goods with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Indians had attempted to run off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Virginian with his shoulder. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut was only three inches long and little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than through the skin. When he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed and bound it the canoe had returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all four immediately began prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions for departure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was no time for Dick to ask ques-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions as to the plans of the party. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Miamis, three of whom they knew were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">badly wounded if not dead, would be back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at night with a larger party, and the urgent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">need was to get as far away as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As to what part of the French country he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had reached, what the three coureurs de bois</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">intended to do, and the explanation of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">own presence in the country, all that could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wait until a less strenuous time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two canoes of the party were soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded and Dick took the bow of one with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michel in the stern. His shoulder was</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritated by the exertion of paddling but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said nothing, and their craft, though heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded and propelled against the current,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not lag behind the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They paddled all afternoon without</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopping and the sun had set when at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">they turned ashore.

Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the second load was portaged night had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen, and through the darkness they toiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth, bearing canoes, bales of</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods and casks of brandy upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs. It was after midnight when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last article had been carried across, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even then there was no rest. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes were loaded and turned down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream and until after sunrise they jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neyed on into the southwest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, Basile!" cried Michel when the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">was high. "We have left the country of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miamis and must be in that of the Islinois,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the thieves dare not follow. Let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">go ashore and eat and sleep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Basile turned his canoe toward a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">camping-spot. They cooked a meal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then all except Leon stretched out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade of some willows. Later Michel was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wakened and stood guard, and at noon they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were again in the canoes. Until darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended upon the river Basile did not per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit lagging, and then, after a hasty meal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all four dropped asleep in the long grass on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun had risen high enough to be un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable before they wakened in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, and even then they only sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade and slept a little longer. Dick saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Frenchmen did not fear possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit by the Miamis and that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in no huriy to go on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was glad of the opportunity not only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest but because they could now tell him</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of where he was, where they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going and what they intended to do. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happy because he had reached the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the French, because he had joined a band</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the courcurs de bois, but his restless spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not content with a mere following of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the life of these adventurers, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen to construe Basile's hostility as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenge to the leadership of these free</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits of the wilderness. As he had noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to conceal and recognized the value of</seg><seg type="columnLine">frankness in cementing the friendship</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he knew he had gained with Leon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Michel, he chose the indolent hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forenoon to tell of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Friends," he began, "my coming among</seg><seg type="columnLine">you has seemed strange, and it is as much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as to yourselves. I will begin at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning and tell of myself all that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could care to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "First, my name is Richard Jeffreys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">generally called Dick, which is the English</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of saying Richard if one of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">name be a close friend. My father is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Jeffreys of the colony of Virginia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which I was born twenty-four years ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had I followed precedent I would now be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gay cavalier, riding a good horse from plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation to plantation, dressed in silks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">satins and lace and gold, a sword at my side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dagger in my belt and never without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quart of sack in my belly. I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had slaves and a chest of money, acres of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobacco and possibly, in time, a seat in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">House of Burgesses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you see I am not. Why? Because</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Virginia a man may let his body wander</seg><seg type="columnLine">at will between tavern and plantation, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween bear-baiting and carousing, while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must leave his mind at home under a lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and key furnished by the king. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">think as the king prescribes, swear only as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as the king permits, go to church or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gallows, and even on his own land plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the king decides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I chose to cramp my body within buck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin and let my mind wander, to think and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swear and live as I willed, and that is how</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And welcome you are!" exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michel. "Without your swinging musket</seg><seg type="columnLine">there at the forks of the Chicagon we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been dead men. We'll broach a keg</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your health and the success of all of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There appears to be much still to be ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained," growled Basile. "An Englishman</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in New France smells to me too much of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen further," replied Dick amiably,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and answering the leader's hostile glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a smile. "I was about to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told of his boyhood, how he had ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired a desire for the forests rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the settlements through his early associa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with the savages, of how he had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">north through the land of the Delawares,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the colony of the Dutch, the land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mohicans and finally to the St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lawrence, where he had spent a Winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a trader licensed by the French king.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From tales he had heard there he had first</seg><seg type="columnLine">become enamored of the life of the coureurs</seg><seg type="columnLine">de bois in that great and little-known land</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the westward on the shores of the five</seg><seg type="columnLine">great lakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And who was that trader?" asked Basile</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply, and with a cunning smile for Leon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Michel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His name was Simon Bouisson," an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered Dick readily, "and he traded to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward of Quebec."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Simon Bouisson!" shouted Michel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">glee. "And how, friend, did this Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Bouisson appear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have never been in your Paris but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine that the gargoyles on one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous buildings are not at all unlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simon," answered Dick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leon and Michel rolled upon the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the excess of their mirth and even Basile</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined in the laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," he said, "you have still to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">how you, from the colony of Virginia, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the southern shore of the Lake of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islinois, or Lac Mecheygan, as some call it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the land of the Longhouses lies direct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly between. The Iroquois are not in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit of letting any one wander at will</seg><seg type="columnLine">through their domain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DICK began a complete account of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his interview with Sir William</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berkeley and his escape from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaol. Michel and Leon broke in several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times with their laughter and applause.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Basile, as Dick gained favor with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, became more dour of expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a reference to Elizabeth Carver</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her part in his escape, the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginian related how he had started north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to gain the Delawares' country, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be driven in his canoe up the Potomac</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape a hostile band of Paspaheghs. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pursued far and at last took to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods in the Blue Mountains, to wander</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward until he came to a river which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen before and which the savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the Monongahela. The chance dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery of a canoe permitted him to descend</seg><seg type="columnLine">this stream for a long distance without en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countering any one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As this route took him north and straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Iroquois country, he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have misgivings, when the stream was</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined by another and the one current at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last set off toward the southwest, a stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly increasing in size and the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful he had ever seen. When Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">described its lower reaches, and the savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">from whom he escaped, Michel broke in</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the explanation:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is the river the Iroquois call the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ohio, which means something like broad and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful. Farther west it is known to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages as the Ouabashe. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">king's men from Montreal, named La</seg><seg type="columnLine">Salle, traveled on it a ways some seasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. Had you kept on, if the reports of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savages be true, you would have come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the great water, the one the savages to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west speak of as the Misisepe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I would have been there long ere</seg><seg type="columnLine">this had it not been for some red devils I</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountered. They saw me and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">chase, and I turned into a big river that</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed in from the north and went up it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a hundred leagues. Then one</seg><seg type="columnLine">night some knaves who, from the dress, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of it, must have been brothers to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miamis who attacked us on the Chicagon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">got between me and my canoe. I slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in the night, working north, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the French were in that direction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at last came out on what you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Lac Mecheygan, only the day before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw you. I believed it was the sea, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tasted it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now what?" asked Basile sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"As you have seen and as you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard," replied Dick with a smile. "I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">not go back to the English colony. Death</seg><seg type="columnLine">is certain there. Since I spent a year in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New France I have wished to lead the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the coureurs de bois. It appeals to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freedom of thought and action, of mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and body! No law, no rulers! Risks but</seg><seg type="columnLine">no cares, a pleasant land and more pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions! Why are you yourself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranger of the forests. Monsieur Basile?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I am French, in the land of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">French."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick turned to the others with a smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Does the king of France claim this</seg><seg type="columnLine">land?" he asked. "Does he know it is here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am sure that you have never taken re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports to Montreal of what you know of it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ha, ha, Basile!" cried Michel. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">scored there. We found this land beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Lac Mecheygan and we do not intend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give it to any king. Why should we rim</seg><seg type="columnLine">the risks for fat loafers in Europe? No!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Dick is right, and he is one of us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It makes no difference if he is English. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">has the soul of the forest-rangers, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is enough for us. Eh, Leon?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I care not if he be Dutch or Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the way he charged the Miamis,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed Leon. "We started with four. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">will end with four. Let Monsieur Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">have Gabriel's share. He'll earn it before</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Basile's face had become black as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others spoke, but before he could voice his</seg><seg type="columnLine">protest Dick, who had been watching him</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely, interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will not permit such generosity," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared. "It is not right and I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish it. It is the life, not the profits, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">crave. Only let me continue with you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharing in the labor and the risks, and I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">content. Then, the next year, perhaps."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He is as fair and generous as he is brave!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried Michel. "Come, Basile! Iron out</seg><seg type="columnLine">your face. Monsieur Dick is to be one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of us, always," agreed Leon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The days went by, wonderful days for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Virginian. Never before had he seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">so fair a country. The river flowed gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">between prairie banks. Trees bordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream and wandered in patches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">long lines out on to the plains. The sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone brightly, inviting indolence. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">breezes over the land were sweet and fresh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each day they dropped a little farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the stream. Before long they en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered a larger river, the river of the Islinois,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick was informed, though none of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchmen, and no white men before them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever been so far.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They feasted as they went. Wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">turkeys were in the trees. Raspberries</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ripe, and the three Frenchmen showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick how to dig and boil the prairie apple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which tasted to the Virginian much like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">potato of the colonies. Deer grazed about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them in herds. Fish of many kinds were</seg><seg type="columnLine">plentiful in die water. They saw, too, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time, the pisikous, the bceufs sau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vage, or wild cattle. Dick had never heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these animals, though the other three had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known of the huge beasts through savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">reports, and their first encounter brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">consternation to all four.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No longer than domestic cattle but twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size, with great humps on their shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">and massive heads in which beady eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were set beneath black, curving horns and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the midst of a wealth of brown, curling</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair, they roamed the plains in great herds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their size, their numbers, and the ferocious</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of the males, sent the four men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in terror to their canoes when first en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered. Later Leon killed one and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had tasted the tongue and the meat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hump, and bands of the animals were</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen every day, they were accepted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely one of the bounties of this un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed of land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FROM the beginning Dick fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily into the indolent, careless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">untrammeled life of his companions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For hours each day, and always in the eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, they lay in the shade or beside a fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told tales, experiences and adventures</seg><seg type="columnLine">in far, strange places, among stranger people</seg><seg type="columnLine">in wildernesses where no white men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever been before. History has given to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some men the distinction of being first in</seg><seg type="columnLine">various places, but in the land of the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lakes and beyond, both to the west and</seg><seg type="columnLine">north, the coureurs de bois, seeking adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, freedom and opportunities for illicit</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade with the Indians, far outstripped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emissaries of the king of France and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courageous Jesuits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick caught at once the significance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these stories. It was well, among them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, to tell of far places, but a whisper of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on the St. Lawrence meant prison and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps worse. He learned that Leon La</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gard, with one companion, had penetrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rich fur country to the north of Lac</seg><seg type="columnLine">Superior, the greatest and the most distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great lakes; that Michel Charon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone west from the same lake until he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed the forest and come to a great plain;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Basile Pombert had gone south from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lac Mecheygan, past Uie Ouabashe, or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ohio of the Iroquois, until he had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages with muskets obtained from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spaniards of La Floride.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But this Red Sea, this Gulf of California,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this land of gold and precious stones, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of you seen it, or been near it?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick, his imagination inflamed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who knows?" answered Leon with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrug of his shoulders. "Perhaps this very</seg><seg type="columnLine">river of the Islinois enters it. Perhaps to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow we will be floating upon salt water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along the western shore of Lac Mecheygan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all along the shores of Lac Superior, always</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savages speak of the Misisepe, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michisepe, 'the great water,' as the Algon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quin tongue expresses it, a land of strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, of huge monsters and fiery demons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have never known any who have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it, though some have informed me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have been told that its waters are salt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once, south of Lac Superior, when among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Outaouacs and the Hurons, who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursued there by the Iroquois, on a river</seg><seg type="columnLine">they called Le Noir, or the Black, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">told that if I kept on down-stream I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the Misisepe. I would have gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was late in the season."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is a 'blackrobe' even now at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michilimakinac called Marquette," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michel, "who plans to go to this Misisepe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We stopped there on our way to the Chica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gon River and he asked us many questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">about where we had been and what we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of the place. He has an idea it is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, from what he told us, and that it flows</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Gulf of California. Even now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaits orders from his superior to go to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the 'great water' next year, and he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pects the governor of New France to send a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to accompany him. Then they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim it for the king."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you, who have been farther than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others, you and the other coureurs de</seg><seg type="columnLine">bois, have you never claimed what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have found?" asked Dick. "From the Lac</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mecheygan and Lac Superior westward, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is any man's land, any king's, open to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first who sees and claims it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We claim it for our own, for what that</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim be worth," answered Michel. "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should we take it for a king? The king's</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and the king's laws, would come in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive us out for our pains. There is enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">land to the east for the fawners, for the men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">with king's licenses and favors, for the faint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts who dare not go beyond the sight of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plowed field or sound of church bells, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who fear they might die unshriven.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This land is for us who dare come to it, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it will remain ours if we can keep the 'black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">robes' and others back. This Marquette</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned nothing from us that will be to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage, and if we can first see some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savages on his route we may keep him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out altogether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Monsieur Dick. Remember that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are to forget all that you see and hear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A discreet tongue is the sign of the coureurs</seg><seg type="columnLine">de bois."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has already shown that his tongue is</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose," interrupted Basile fiercely. "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known from the first that there was no good</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an Englishman coming into this land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An Englishman is too greedy to seek only</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure. His knees are too weak from</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending to a throne to carry him so far into</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage country merely to gain freedom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leon! Michel! Did you not see his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam when he asked of the Red Sea and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold and rubies? Did you not catch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone of his voice when he wanted to know if</seg><seg type="columnLine">this land of ours has been taken in the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a king?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tell you, this Monsieur Dick is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">English spy, a man who came into our</seg><seg type="columnLine">country to take it for his own king.

Dick, seeing him come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would attempt to rise to defend himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In that defenseless position the knife would</seg><seg type="columnLine">descend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Dick only pretended to rise. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead he rolled into a ball and flung himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Basile's feet. As the Frenchman</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled headlong he himself sprang up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had been lying at the edge of a bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-feet high, a deep pool directly beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Basile's fall had carried him close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the brink and Dick, with a push of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot, sent him flying out into the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leon and Michel had taken no part in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair but now, as Dick stood there laughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the antics of Basile as he rose to the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, they suddenly sprang to their feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The savages!" they cried in a low tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">together. "See! Over the river. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islinois we have been seeking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick looked across the stream. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther bank, standing in the shade of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">willows, were two score or more of Indians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISLINOIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LEON LA GARD ran at once to Dick's</seg><seg type="columnLine">J side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No more fighting," he whispered. "Pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend it was only merriment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bent over the bank, up which Basile</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pombert, his knife still in his hand, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing to return to the attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fool!" Leon hissed. "Look across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. We have reached the Islinois. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are watching us. Climb the bank and pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend you were only having sport with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsieur Dick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Basile turned and saw the Indians for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time. Instantly his rage vanished and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the angry glint in his eyes was succeeded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a covetous gleam that, to Dick, was even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more sinister than the frank hatred to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had become accustomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your hand, Dick!" he cried suddenly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Help me up, and laugh, all of you. Michel!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come and join us! All of you! Clasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and circle 'round. They'll think it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dance to end our sport."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Laughing uproariously, kicking their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels as they spun about, the four joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and whirled madly for a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they swung into line and faced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians across the stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The calumet, Michel," whispered Basile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Michel went to a pack and took out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-stemmed pipe which he filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobacco.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," directed Basile, "you and Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">get into a canoe and take it to their chief to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke. Then bring him and one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">others back. Their tongue is much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the other savages we know and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can speak with them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Michel directed Dick into the stern of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe and himself stood in the bow, bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pipe aloft. The Frenchmen seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no fear whatever of this strange peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple who undoubtedly had never seen white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and the Virginian, accepting their be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief in the friendliness of the natives, pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">died vigorously toward the opposite shore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As they approached, Michel holding the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth-piece of the pipe toward the savages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them detached himself from the group</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the trees and stepped toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank. Straight, tall, naked except for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few ornaments, his brown skin gleaming in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunshine, his face expressionless, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief stood there in all the dignity with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Indian was once able to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shroud himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bow of the canoe touched the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Michel stepped out. With flint and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel he deftly lighted the tobacco in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone bowl as the chief placed his lips to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth-piece and puffed. Michel smoked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Others came forward and the pipe went the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a word was spoken, not even a whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per was heard in the closely packed group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians. When Dick and Michel looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them they seemed to be at ease, uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned, but their curiosity could not be en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely hidden and several times the Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginian, on turning quickly, surprised stares</seg><seg type="columnLine">of amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ceremony of the pipe completed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michel indicated to the leader that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enter the canoe and cross the river. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so without hesitation and in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes was being courteously welcomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Basile and Leon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was with difficulty that Dick repressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his excitement. It had been his hope, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving Virginia, that he could work north</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the St. Lawrence and enter the fur trade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In time he hoped to become one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coureurs de bois, to penetrate that amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">country to the west of which such strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories were heard, to go on with some ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venturous companions into new lands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">among new people, to be the first some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, as a result of his misfortunes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring and early Summer,, he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven far to the west, only to encounter at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once the very men he had sought and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first weeks to be, with them, the first white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in a new wilderness, the first to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">these nations that possessed a land so fer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tile and abundant in all that one could wish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked forward eagerly to the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come of the present ceremonies which, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, so delighted the savage heart, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">establishment of friendly relations with</seg><seg type="columnLine">these people and the development of a pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perous trade. As for his trouble with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile, he gave it little thought. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Frenchman, because of cleverness</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and love of power, had won to leadership</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the careless, easy-going Leon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michel. Dick himself had been a favorite</seg><seg type="columnLine">with these two from the beginning and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain aggressiveness and confidence had</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused in Basile the fear of a rival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was this that lay at the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman's charges of spying, that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompted his attack that morning. Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">in no way feared Basile. Settlement of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question of supremacy between the two was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitable and its hazards were part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">life he sought. If Basile, fired by hatred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could let the matter drop in the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the real business of the party, Dick could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well. Accordingly he turned his whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the ceremonies now being en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First Basile made the chief a present of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel knife, exhibiting its keenness and hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. The savage's eyes glowed with pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure and continually he tried the edge with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thumb, laughing outright when too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure caused a deep gash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he was given a hatchet, the blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which was as sharp as that of the knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile, who had quickly taken note of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone-tipped arrows, stone knives and horn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronged war club of the chief, made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the superiority of die steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the presents were being tested and</seg><seg type="columnLine">admired Dick glanced across the river to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover that every savage had disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he searched the bank, expecting some</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruse and realizing their helpless position</seg><seg type="columnLine">should the Indians become hostile, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned the reason. Down-stream and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving across the plain toward the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a cloud shadow, only darker, and mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a noise like distant thunder, was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd of bteufs sauvage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Basile!" cried Dick as he picked up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">musket. "See. I'll now show them what</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder can do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped down the bank, pushed off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe and paddled quickly toward the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching herd. In midstream he caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of some of the band hiding behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fringe of willows at a point near which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffalo would reach the river. He landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and joined them, his musket ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Islinois, arrows ready, bows half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn, were intent upon the game until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man strode in among them. At first</seg><seg type="columnLine">his coming caused some resentment but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick's confident, expectant attitude, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm assurance and manner of holding what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew must be some sort of weapon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused curiosity, almost forgetfulness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the game. They gathered near him, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his hair, his skin, his eyes and, not with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out amusement, at his weapon, if weapon it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be. Then one of them gave a low hiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all turned to see the edge of the herd</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping close to the shelter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately Dick stepped out. Not an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian followed, nor was an arrow loosened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All gazed in wonder at this hunter who so</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed himself, who stood as if looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the game in idle curiosity. As they</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched, the Virginian suddenly lifted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">musket to his shoulder. A roar followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smoke rolled forth in a cloud. When it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted a monster bull lay on the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicking in his death agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a bow to the hunters and a magnan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imous wave of his hand toward the quarry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick walked back toward his canoe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddled across the stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bravo!" cried Michel as he landed. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">master stroke, Monsieur Dick! We could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see you plainly and you should have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to watch the chief's face. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than grasped what you had done than</seg><seg type="columnLine">we presented him with a musket and he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">invited us down to the village. It's only</seg><seg type="columnLine">two leagues down the stream and we start at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. Mon Dieul What a haul we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">make. We haven't broached a cask. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Trying vainly to repress his emotions, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman danced gaily back to his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions beside the chief. That worthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose as Dick approached and held out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. He spoke a few words, most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Dick grasped because of their simi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larity to other Algonquin tongues.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come boys," commanded Basile. "Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you take the chief across now so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can talk with his men. Then bring him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and we'll take him to the village in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the canoes. These people never use</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats and it will please him to ride upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick and Michel paddled the chief across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river where his men crowded about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an excited, jabbering group, each trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be first to handle the mysterious weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their leader so proudly displayed. He is-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sued a few brief directions and then re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back at their camp the four white men</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded their canoes rapidly and then, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief reposing in state in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">craft paddled by Basile and Leon, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned down-river, accompanied by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting, excited savages on shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN LITTLE more than an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">the village, strung along the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank of the river, was reached.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The noisy escort had announced their com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing long before and the shore was crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with women, children and old men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's good," Michel whispered to Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">with quick relief when he saw the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of cabincs. "The forty hunters are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the men of the village, which means there</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't be too many to handle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't expect trouble surely after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the friendly manner in which they received</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, do you?" asked the Virginian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is always trouble when a savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brandy get together. I have heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there are more than a hundred thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand of these people, who are the richest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most powerful of any nation the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">have met, excepting always the Longhouses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They grow big fields of corn and roots and</seg><seg type="columnLine">melons and squashes, there is game enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for four times as many on these plains, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is said that they never know what famine</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, as is so often the case with the nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the north. These people sow their crops</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then go out for game, come home and</seg><seg type="columnLine">harvest what they have planted, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they go for the big Winter hunt. That is</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the other savages have said of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it is known that they always live in</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The canoes were landed and when Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed the bank he saw that Michel had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stretched the truth. Compared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northern Indians, especially those in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country beyond the St. Lawrence, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were indeed a pleasant people in a land more</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant than he liad ever dreamed of.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he passed through the throng lie was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed by the courtesy of their manner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their happiness and contentment as ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed in sleek bodies and smiling faces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old and young, they seemed like happy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frolicking children, sincere in their welcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the white strangers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dick, in his attitude toward life, was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a child himself and, not only be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he knew that a quick way to an In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian's heart is through his child, but be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause this scene of contentment had cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tivated his spirit, he picked up a naked little</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy and tossed him into the air again and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">again. At first the child was frightened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but against Dick's infectious smile its terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">was powerless, and when at last he swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">the youngster to his shoulder and strode off</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the village the child fastened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers in his hair and chattered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here," growled Basile as Dick re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the shore. "We'd not have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread of anything left if we all ran off and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left these savages to do as they wished with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoes. You and Michel stay here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard them while Leon and I have a talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the chief. We must see what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to trade before we go further."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick set the child down and joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have a gay heart," said the coureur</seg><seg type="columnLine">de bois, "but there is always a time in life</seg><seg type="columnLine">when one must be serious, and we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached it now. The chief desires to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">off runners to inform another village down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">river of our arrival, but we don't want any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than we have here, and not these</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless it be worth our while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick did not reply. It was not this</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual seriousness of the ordinarily care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">free Michel that silenced him but some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing sinister in the cold, calculating meth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ods of the Frenchmen. To the Virginian</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade with the savages meant an exchange</seg><seg type="columnLine">of goods for fur and food. If these Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not have much they could trade for</seg><seg type="columnLine">what there was and go on to the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">village. Why need fear greater numbers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such friendly, happy, contented people?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reviewed these amazing plans and ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions as he sat on the bow of the canoe but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the memory of his happy hours with Michel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Leon forced him to the conclusion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile, with his scheming, his evil mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone was at the bottom of any possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">knavery. The other two, indolent, light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted, unaspiring, were merely tools in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the older man's hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time since he had joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">them Dick entertained a serious thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was in the resolution that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">give Basile cause for his jealousy, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would wrest the leadership from this vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lainous Frenchman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he came to this decision Leon ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the canoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's good news," he cried. "They have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wealth of beaver skins and many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller animals, besides dozens of fine speci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mens of the robes of the baeufs sauvage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile has dissuaded the chief from sum-i</seg><seg type="columnLine">moning the next village and we are to begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">trading at once. Out with the bales, boys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all but the casks. They'll wait until to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three began to unload the canoes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basile and the chief soon joined them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the goods were arranged on the bank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More presents were made to the leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of the village and then the trading</seg><seg type="columnLine">began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first Dick was inclined to be a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashamed of the values given and received</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he forgot it in the expression of happi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness upon the faces of the savages and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reflection that the Frenchmen had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the goods safely through more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than six hundred leagues of wilderness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He and Michel were set to work baling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the furs received and for the remainder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day he had little time for anything else.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At sunset the goods were exhausted and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians still had many furs. Basile looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the others and Leon and Michel nodded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A cask was immediately brought from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes and broached. Basile let a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a gourd and passed it to the chief, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaining that it was the strong water of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">French of which he undoubtedly had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">from other savages, that it made the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine and the rain cease, the heart gay and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feet light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chief took a swallow and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched his throat in sudden fear as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">potent liquor scorched and choked him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as it reached his stomach and</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmed it, he patted his abdomen and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile spread over his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Basile held the gourd toward him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again the chief drank, this time greed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily, despite the burning sensation in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat.

The leader, who was most</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently feeling the effects of the brandy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened for a moment, caught the meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what the Frenchman was saying, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tfien turned to his people, to whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately there was a scramble of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying to the cabins.

Basile in the meantime</seg><seg type="columnLine">had unloaded the casks and the savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumped the village arsenal into the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why are we doing this?" demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick when he and Michel, at Basile's com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand, had paddled the two canoes across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river and emptied their contents upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To save our own precious heads from</seg><seg type="columnLine">being split open tonight," was the laughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply.

He scorned to chew to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bacco, run from anybody, or tell an out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right lie; and he swore fluently as a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of safety-valve, but his silent and patient</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother didn't know it.

It drowned out all</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in the monopoly of cornstalk water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels that he had planned; even the finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had cut with the old barlow was for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten. He ran toward home to show his</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize of prizes to his mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looky here!" he exclaimed as he dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in at the open cabin doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he stopped short. There, talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his mother, was Little Jerusalem's</seg><seg type="columnLine">herb-digger, fortune-teller, and newspaper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old and wrinkled Granny Hood, with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe of clay and her sourwood staff. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was smoking like a burning brush-heap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck saw that she wore a dark calico dress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a red bandanna, and a red undershirt--at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, Bucky boy?" asked Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Newland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to her and showed her the knife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">He told her all that he had to tell about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his new friend. Mary Newland turned a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little pale at the name, even as Delaney</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone a little pale at hers. She took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the handsome knife to the fire that smol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered in the wide-mouthed stone fireplace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and consigned it to the live coals; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she unwrapped the crimson-stained hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerchief from her son's injured finger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to throw it, too, into the fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Granny Hood called shrilly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't Mary! It's bad luck! It's bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck to burn blood!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mary Newland dropped the handker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief to the hearth. Perhaps, she reasoned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be better to wash it and send it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, to let him know that she didn't care</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be under obligations to him for even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapping of a finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUCK wondered at this. To Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the un-understandable. Dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all that century of time, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother had never said a word. The look</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her eyes had kept him from uttering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">protest. He turned to Granny Hood, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he expected her to tell him what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the matter. The old scandal-monger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was by no means loath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was Daredevil Delaney, boy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she croaked, "and he's a plumb bad man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's rich; he heired his daddy's farm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blood of the Allisons</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">big frame house at the lower end o' this</seg><seg type="columnLine">here valley, whar he lives with his maw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He owns timber, and cattle, sheeps, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hosses.

The law don't seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be able to git any proof on him. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">yit, I did hear o' the county sheriff afore</seg><seg type="columnLine">this'n a sayin' 'at Daredevil made about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the best law they could have out here-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this point Mary Newland interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a tremulous, white voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That'll be enough about Hale Delaney,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	reckon, Granny Hood. Maybe you didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it, but I don't 'low his name spoke in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my house, Granny."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The peppery old woman rose on her long</seg><seg type="columnLine">staff, half-angry, and turned toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. But she stopped and faced about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was a fine young man ontel ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwed him down, Mary, and you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as well's ye know night's dark. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hain't never keered for nothin' sence that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. I reckon I won't bother ye no more."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And I reckon I won't cry about it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the spicy reply of the young widow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Granny Hood stamped her way out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sourwood staff. Mrs. Newland went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to her sewing, but she seemed to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything wrong. Even Buck noticed it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally a question took form in his mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he decided to risk asking it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mother, what made ye throw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was afore I was married," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnly. "We had the wo'st quarrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world. I swore I never would speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him no more, and I never have. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The truth of the matter was that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had married for spite, as women--more</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially women of the mountains--do</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then. For herself she had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thorny bed, but she had lain in it well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oh, exceedingly well; which went far to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove the soul of a martyr saint deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in the woman. She had the intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature, and the corresponding temper of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning-fire, of a people who had fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves well nigh to extinction; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was still angry at Daredevil Delaney</seg><seg type="columnLine">because she loved him above everything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except Buck, on earth. But she wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit it to herself. Never! You know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">women are with their love affairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Contrary to Granny Hood's opinion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the matter, Mary Allison's "throwing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him down" had not made Delaney the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man he was. Had he married her, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been the same wild, good-natured and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rollicking, free-blooded daredevil that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, though he probably wouldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambled any. The greatest result of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">refusing to be his wife had been only that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had remained unmarried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now this Delaney was not what one</seg><seg type="columnLine">might call bad. He simply saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of his neighborhood and neighboring</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighborhoods lived with a fair semblance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of correctness, that was all. If a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not providing for his family, he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning; if he did not immediately mend</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ways, Daredevil Delaney gave him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipping that he did not soon forget.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney caused men to pay their debts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">support the preacher, and buy more corn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal and bacon than yellow-corn whisky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, he had his enemies as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friends; and, of course, there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">committed grave crimes that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">put at his door--which was inevitable, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which often had placed him in jeopardy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his position one scarcely to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">envied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mother," suddenly asked Buck, "are</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye sick? Ye look like ye was."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mary Newland that was Mary Allison</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned her eyes upward from the sewing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was now so difficult for her to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I think I am, a little. I think I ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">'o walk out some, maybe/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She rose and dropped her sewing to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair; she put on her blue gingham bonnet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started for the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Le's go down to see my flutter-wheel,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested Buck. "Y'ought 'o see it agoin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">clippety-clippety-clip. Will ye, mother?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe you'd better stay around home,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Mary Newland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She passed across the threshold, and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly toward the gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy stood in the cabin doorway and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched her go with keen disappointment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his clear brown eyes. It was very unlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to refuse to let him accompany her</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere. Buck did not know that, down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley and up a silent, hemlock-filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">cove, there was an old trysting-place that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still to her a shrine--a great and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful white beech tree laden with</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden yellow leaves, and under it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubbling spring bordered with sword-ferns</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laurel, while cut in the bark of the tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the almost grown-over initials, M. A.</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and H. D. Nor did Buck know that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old shrine was calling, calling to his mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it had never, never called before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lad walked down to the ripe corn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, took another big cornstalk, went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cabin and borrowed a table-knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cupboard, and made a cornstalk</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiddle. It was after sundown when Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Newland returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following morning, she washed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ironed Daredevil Delaney's handkerchief--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she did a job to be proud of--wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in a page of an old story-paper, and sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck to the Delaney home with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go right to the house, and come right</seg><seg type="columnLine">back," she instructed. "Don't stay, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't talk to 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wellum," said Buck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once in the crooked road, Buck decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was utterly too weary to walk such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great distance--it was fully a mile; there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he broke off a long, frostbitten iron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weed for a sleek black horse, mounted it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rode at a gallop most of the way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney frame house at the lower end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley. The house set a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the road, and there were apple-trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it and to either side of it and march-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up the gentle slope behind it. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been painted white, and honeysuckles ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the front porch. A hound ran out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and growled at him, and the voice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daredevil Delaney promptly scolded it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on in, son," said Delaney. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't let him bite ye."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buck went on. Delaney sat on the porch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaiting a rawhide band for his hat; he rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushed his chair toward the boy. Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head, and tossed the little package</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the other's hands.

Delaney was unarmed, and Emmett</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a big man; besides, Delaney knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the other wouldn't shoot. Emmett</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the much-troubled Mrs. Delaney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please step into the house," he requested</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go, mother," said the mountaineer;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she went.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buck Newland stood like a post, his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">as serious as a mask of Napoleon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched every movement of the deputy as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took handcuffs from his belt and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced upon his man. Delaney's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed at the sight of the disgraceful irons;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went suddenly white as he put out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists as though to receive the manacles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A look of satisfaction spread over Emmett's</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance. But Delaney seized the irons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore them from the other's hands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed them into one of his own rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">trousers pockets!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one second Emmett stared in sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. They sprang to the ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced each other. To run from one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was much against Delaney's liking, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officer now had drawn a weapon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney dove under with the lithe quickness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of a panther; with his left hand he caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emmett's gun-wrist, and with his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wrenched the revolver free; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the deputy a chest blow that stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered him, stepped backward, and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revolver over apple-trees and into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackberry thicket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this, the lowlander did a thing an</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer of the law never should have done:</seg><seg type="columnLine">he flew into a rage, gritted out an oath, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck at the hillman with a punch that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have broken bones if it had landed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From that moment it became a good, round</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle. Emmett was the stronger of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, but his adversary was electric.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They squared themselves and put up</seg><seg type="columnLine">their guards, much as lumberjack fighters</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. Buck stepped to the ground; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">molasses cake was squeezed almost flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">under one arm, and his face was flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fiery interest. Emmett put himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the offensive at once; he struck, feinted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck again and landed on the other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, spinning him around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hit him!" fairly screamed Buck. "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't ye bust him, Daredevil?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Delaney recovered himself in a way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">delighted the boy. He had to fight now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for his life; to run from an unarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was unthinkable, and he couldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrested. He darted in, cleverly and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately slapped Emmett on the jaw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew Emmett's arms upward, then broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">under with a mighty blow and drove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputy backward twenty feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dawg-gone!" yelled Buck. "That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lulu!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time Emmett had forgotten all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about arresting Delaney; to the deputy</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had become a personal matter. He came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with a hoarse bellow, like a maddened</seg><seg type="columnLine">bull, and struck half a dozen blows that</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed on nothing more solid than air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney gave him a punch on the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jaw, and it dazed him for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pour it to him!" cried Buck. "Pour</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to him, Daredevil! Ye've shore got him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, ef ye'll only pour it to him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Emmett went at his adversary again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, using a part of Delaney's own battling</seg><seg type="columnLine">tactics, knocked Delaney flat. The hill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man lay there, supine, as though he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious, for a few seconds, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting deputy watched him closely. Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Newland put the molasses cake and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apples on the porch, took out his barlow</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife and opened it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">92</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't ye hit him," he told Emmett,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"while he's down. Ef ye do, I'll cut a hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ye."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Delaney rose, came to life like a steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring, and the real battle began. For five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes they battered each other, and blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed from their faces. Then Emmett</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought for a clench; his wind was weakening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Delaney was going faster than ever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney slipped on the grass, and Emmett</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped to his back. But Delaney straighten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed his legs and had the giant on his hip; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">supreme effort, and the big lowlander was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown over Delaney's head and into a heap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another moment, and the mountaineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken the manacles from his pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and snapped them on Emmett's wrists!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a man," he said, smiling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting at the same time, "that I'd haf</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill, to whip. I don't want to kill ye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emmett. I'd sudgest that ye go back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheriff Hanley and explain to him what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">merry job he's agoin' to have a-takin' Hale</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney to jail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a word in reply, Emmett rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked down the road, mounted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, and rode toward Johnsville in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat country. When he was out of sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney turned to Buck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How'd ye like that, son?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine!" Buck answered. "I wisht I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I hope ye'll have more plain com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon sense 'an I've had, son," muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daredevil Delaney, very seriously, "when</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye're a man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down on the steps, bent his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was very still. He was a fool for</seg><seg type="columnLine">having made the name he had made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. To leave his invalid mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely was a thing he could not do, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would arrest him sooner or later;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when they did arrest him, his repu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation would cost him his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Delaney came out and sat down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the step above him. She put a wrinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">old hand on his thick black hair, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">too was very still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The silence was too much for Buck. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up the presents the mother of Dare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil Delaney had given him, went down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the dusty road, mounted his ironweed</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse and galloped toward home. To take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cake and the fruit to his mother would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be to lose them, he knew; so he stopped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water-wheel and made a cache there</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the stones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't show her the barlow knife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either; he didn't dare. But he told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that which Mrs. Delaney had said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell her, and he gave a very vivid account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fight. And the latter-named was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite sufficient to cause Mary Newland to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorch the bread they had for dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CURTIS HOLDEN was not gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally loved like a brother, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an old man, and sentiment over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the county ran high against Hale Delaney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Officers were soon combing the big hills for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and a substantial reward was offered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney remained in the Little Jerusalem</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighborhood, and he was put to his wits'</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, day and night, to provide food for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself and to elude the men who hunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him singly and by twos and threes. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the officers that he feared; the enemies</seg><seg type="columnLine">who hunted him for the sake of the reward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Judases--it was those whom he feared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They knew the fastnesses of the mountains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as he knew them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the meanest and most villainous of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all those enemies discovered Daredevil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney's hiding-place. It was high up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the side of the western mountain, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nest of cliffs and boulders, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impregnable to two, four, or six. Ten men</seg><seg type="columnLine">might take Delaney from that retreat, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would split the reward into ten parts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This long-haired and lanky, cunning enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured for hours to find out how many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times ten would go into a thousand, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head when he finally knew. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he laid a plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had his slatternly third wife go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buckner Newland, the only boy in Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerusalem who didn't know her, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth tale. She found Buck playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the cornstalk water-wheel, as usual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen at her," said Buck. "Clippety-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clippety-clip! Don't she go purty?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sonny," the woman began wheedlingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"do you know Daredevil Delaney?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yeuh," nodded Buck.

There were a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of tilings he held dearer than his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you his Cousin Lucy?" asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," hed Mrs. Tinker Davis III.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Will ye go, sonny?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ef I knowed," said Buck, "whar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman pointed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ye see them big rocks away off up</seg><seg type="columnLine">yander? Ye might go up thar and look.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's shore a likely place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll go, shore," Buck told her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose, crossed the little stream on</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones, and dove into the laurels, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman went down the road. In spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ruggedness of the mountainside, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of the newly fallen chestnut burrs</seg><seg type="columnLine">that now and then pricked his feet painfully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy reached the temporary haunt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his god after an hour of traveling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of his finding Delaney, naturally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney found him. Buck had climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the top of a low cliff, and was searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city of boulders above with all his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Delaney spoke from a point a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance to his left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, son?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hunted man was pale and starved-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking, and his gaze was so piercing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it almost scared Buck Newland. Perched</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the brink of that little precipice, Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">delivered the message of Mrs. Tinker Davis</seg><seg type="columnLine">III. word for word. Now the outlawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney had a Cousin Lucy, of course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What sort o' lookin' woman was she?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he immediately wanted to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She was dressed in yeller and red, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she toted a spicewood toothbresh in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, and she had a wart on her nose."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man before Buck smiled worriedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wart on her nose; eh?

"That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore a lowdown trick to try to play on me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anybody that'd try to do a trick like that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck, is a--ought 'o be killed plumb dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buck, you do me this here favor; go straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Missis Tinker Davis, the polecat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell her I'll make her wisht I'd tarred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathered her man, ef I live.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no outcry, and this fact frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daredevil Delaney. He rushed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brink and peered over. Crumpled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">there on the dead leaves was the inert figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his one-time sweetheart's barefooted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tow-headed boy, with a tiny trickle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson lying across his white and up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Delaney climbed down hurriedly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knelt and took Buck's head and shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his knee, and with his handkerchief wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the blood that had come from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound in the lad's temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Son," he mumbled agonizedly, thickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears filling his eyes, "son!

He put his ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the youthful chest, and heard laintiy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beating of the youthful heart. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed Buck was dying; the heartbeats</seg><seg type="columnLine">were much too faint, it seemed to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ef Tinker Davis don't pay for this,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said in a voice that was bleak, "oh ef</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tinker Davis don't pay for this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For to him it was no accident.

He well knew how that life he</seg><seg type="columnLine">held against his breast was valued. If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out for him--for his sake--he well</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what that would mean, too. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayer went up from the soul of him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy might live, and at the bottom of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing selfish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crossed the brook at the water-wheel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waded it with his boots on when he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have crossed on stones, and he noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">absently that the wheel was still running--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">clippety-clippety-clip. Into the crooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">road he turned, and Sheriff Hanley, hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone a little away down the valley, saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and put spurs to his horse. Riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">up beside Delaney, he leveled his revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the small of his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're under arrest, Daredevil.

At the Newlands'</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate he dismounted and left his horse with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its rein hanging, and followed the other man</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cabin. Mary Newland rose at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sudden entrance, and her sewing</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to the floor. Delaney went</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight to the bed, and put the raglike</seg><seg type="columnLine">form down on an old pieced coverlet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He fell--" he began, and could say no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buck's mother knelt beside him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">just then Buck came to. His wound was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not serious. For a moment he stared at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then at the other of the two men. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the sheriff; the officer had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out to him. Quickly he put</seg><seg type="columnLine">things together, and he understood fully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he fastened accusing eyes on the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the representative of the law, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice came slowly, in words that cut--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mister Sheriff, ye're a-yeller dawg."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Buck," his mother reproved, half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Delaney, filled with gratitude, looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officer put his hand on his man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, and Delaney muttered this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I said ye could have me. So ye can."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They took Daredevil Delaney to Johns-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ville, where they lodged him in the strongest</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell they had. Many, many were those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who visited the jail for a glimpse of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A newspaper man came up from Knoxville,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to get him to talk and tried to photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph him--and failed all around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Court was in session at Johnsville, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney's trial was called without delay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sentiment of the general public had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown even higher against him, and those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were considered versed in such matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">openly predicted that he would soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">straighten out a hangman's rope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE day of the trial was hazy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snap of Autumn was in the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everybody that was anybody in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little Jerusalem went; Buck Newland and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mother rode in chairs in the back of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abner Lane's ox-wagon. Half of Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Newland had been trying to persuade her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she wouldn't help Hale Delaney to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save his immortal soul, while the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">half had been telling her that she must</seg><seg type="columnLine">save him--if she could. Perhaps this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">why she sat down with her boy midway</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crowded courthouse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An elderly man with billygoat whiskers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a broad, bare upper lip sat next to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young widow and her son, chewed store-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought tobacco and spat through a knot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole in the floor, and berated Daredevil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney for all he was worth. One-half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Buck's pretty mother rejoiced at it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other half resented it. All of Buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">resented it bitterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd be askeered to talk that way,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly blurted the lad, "ef he wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">whar .he's at.

Curtis Holden's dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement counted heavily. Counsel for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the defense proved that Holden was half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind, and that it was nearly dark in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden's sitting-room at four o'clock in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon, but all that seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">impress the jury but little. Delaney's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputation was very bad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was short. Soon the judge was</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging the jury, and it was not in favor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the accused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as the charge was being finished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary Newland rose--and Buck followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her--and went up to the judge. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sworn, and she took the witness stand for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoner, who could hardly believe he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw correctly. And there she did that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to the woman of the mountains is</seg><seg type="columnLine">next to death: she bravely told the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her early love affair with. Hale Delaney,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of their bitter quarrel; of her marrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">for spite, and of her lying for five years in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bed of thorns she had made; of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heathens</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle to support herself and her son; of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the burning of the knife that Hale Delaney</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given to the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she told of her going to the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">beech at the bubbling spring, the old beech</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had their initials cut in its white bark;</seg><seg type="columnLine">she told of watching Delaney renew those</seg><seg type="columnLine">initials with the knife that had been her</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's, and of watching him for a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he sat there and thought of the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that were in her own mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that had been from three to five o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the afternoon of October fourth, the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">time of Curtis Holden's assault and robbery!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mary Newland withstood the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">grilling cross-questioning; they couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">entangle her. Counsel for the defense</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his argument again, and this time it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had strength with the jury. Delaney was</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquitted; received a kindly lecture from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge, and promised to remember it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he looked for Mary Newland that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been Mary Allison, she was gone back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her cabin in Little Jerusalem.

Buck called out a cordial</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come in!" The door opened, and Hale</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delaney entered; he walked straight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone hearth, knelt before her who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been his first and only sweetheart, and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">up both her hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the fust time I've ever bent my</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees to anything mortal in the universe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary," he said.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's eyes twinkled hopefully in the fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and she remembered his saying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the courthouse: "I love him." She lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kneeling man's hands to her lips and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kissed them; she bent her head to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, happy because hate was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've burnt enough blood," she told him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll marry ye, Hale."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next week Delaney was made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputy sheriff, and the week after that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he arrested Tinker Davis for the robbery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and murder of Curtis Holden.

When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon came out she snatched a handful</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scarlet flowers from an hibiscus and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck them into her hair. Then from some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in her memory there stirred the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribal songs of war and love that Naima,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mother, had chanted to her from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time she first lay crooning on a mat; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the moon lifted itself to the dome of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, she rushed into a grassy open space</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaped about, swaying her body and</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing her hands to the rhythm of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild songs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rideout stood and watched her. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen anything like it. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic of the moon, of youth and love and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the joy of having her at last, loosened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bashfulness before Jake, and he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sing out and playfully to sway the ax he</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried--"to build their nest with back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bush," he had told Jake. He tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch her, and soon he was leaping about</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whooping almost as madly as she.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Around and around they circled and spun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild with youth and love, and instinctively</seg><seg type="columnLine">celebrating their joy in that same bounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">play and rhythmic shouting that no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled the newly-created animals in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forests of Eden when the father and mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us all first awoke and found themselves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">alive.

Then she offered the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the skipper, who, however, told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep it, and they climbed over the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the waiting canoe and shoved off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Broth and medicine from the ship's chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought Rideout around to a bit of strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his senses in a few days, but he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not forget Schwartz at any hour of the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">or night, though he did not remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly anything after the fight up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wanted Tavau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would not be quiet when he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was not on the ship, and nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out of his head again when Jake told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him how Tonogo had roused the wild blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her so that she had gone right back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil-devil dancing and idol-worship like</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wild grandmothers before her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I always thought Tavau was different,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake said tenderly to the boy.

But, Lord, how the trail would</seg><seg type="columnLine">call him in the years to come. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught a flutter of Betty's skirts as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched by the door and he could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of the maid.

Prior to that Betty</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been glad enough to see him. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enraged at the girl, too, for playing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his love. If Cameron had been wiped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that last fight on the Oriskany--but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too evil a thought, especially seeing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was useless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been an hour on the trail when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pounding of hoofs ahead aroused him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his black thoughts. He drew aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dully wondering who might be riding so</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard and fast. With an exclamation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm he jumped to the middle of the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raised his hand for her to stop; for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Mrs. Blanchard. She pointed behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and gestured for him to run back; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was the glare of insanity in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind her ran one of the Cotton boys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striving to cling to the stirrup, and his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ghastly with fright. As Mrs. Blanch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard swept by, screaming something the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranger did not catch, the boy tripped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled at his feet. On swept horse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yanking the boy to his feet Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook him fiercely and stilled his blubbering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he could speak the lad gasped:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Iroquois! Devens Farms! The miller</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Blanchard killed. Miller's hired man</seg><seg type="columnLine">made our cabin and fetched the word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our fambly's started for the settlement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Father give Mrs. Blanchard the hoss to</seg><seg type="columnLine">git home. I'm to go with 'em. The red</seg><seg type="columnLine">hellions will be along any minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off and with a faint scream</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed up the trail, then turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scuttled off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Martin beheld a shaft of smoke slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising above the forest crown. The Iro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quois had reached the Cotton clearing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at work. The tragedy made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget his own troubles. Blanchard dead!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed impossible. He always had</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked the man. He carefully selected a</seg><seg type="columnLine">position on the river-bank and slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">several Inlets into his mouth. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come down the trail and if he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold them back a bit Mrs. Blanchard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Betty would stand a good chance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The volume of smoke increased and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought the faint breeze brought on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragrant breath the sound of triumphant</seg><seg type="columnLine">yells, but it might have been the murmur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the river. Minutes passed, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty seconds adding to the fugitives'</seg><seg type="columnLine">security, then with much awkward plunging</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cow came down the trail, behind her ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">two savages, their painted faces making</seg><seg type="columnLine">them devils. Martin picked off the rear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most with a ball through his shaven head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but before he could reload and bag the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other a rifle cracked near-by and the fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage crashed on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Martin looked 'round and beheld Cam- i</seg><seg type="columnLine">eron reloading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The women?" he barked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Making east with the boy. They know</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way. Thought I could do more good</seg><seg type="columnLine">up here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You oughter gone with 'em," growled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guess I know what to do when it comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to taking care of Betty," snarled the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can go to-after this is over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I never 'lowed to fight by your side ag'in,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled Martin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cameron's big face grimaced with rage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he clicked a bullet against his white</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth and glared up the trail. Now they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming, a hideous, whooping throng,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the leader wildly brandishing a gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">scalp. Martin shuddered and prayed Betty</seg><seg type="columnLine">might never see it, and forthwith bowled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the bearer. A second later Cameron</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought down another; but instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding back, the Iroquois came on, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance, there were but two, and knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would not have time to reload.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Martin ducked low and ran toward them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising and discharging his two pistols into</seg><seg type="columnLine">A New Keeper of the Wampum</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their midst and throwing them into con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion. But Cameron, relying on his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, rushed up the open trail, bellowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a bull and using his rifle for a club and</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking it on a skull at the first swing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An Indian landed on Martin's back and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand clutched his scalplock. Ducking low</seg><seg type="columnLine">he threw his assailant over his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knifed him just as another warrior dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into him full-tilt. He glimpsed Cameron</seg><seg type="columnLine">going down beneath a mass of savages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then rolled into the river, taking his assail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     MARTIN lay in the bush with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle covering the doorway of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blanchard cabin. He knew Betty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her mother reached Schenectady. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed Cameron must have died that day</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ttail, although he had found no</seg><seg type="columnLine">determining proof after searching the woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Devens Farms to this clearing. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">he prowled through forest and deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmsteads he had felt guilty of trying on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead man's shoes. Were he positive Cam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eron were alive he would have lost no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in making for far-off Michilimackinac.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now the cabin held his attention because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had detected a movement inside. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped it might be a straggling Iroquois</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent on loot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again something stirred inside, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden horror enveloped him. What if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Cameron had escaped, and, like him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, had wandered back to his sweetheart's</seg><seg type="columnLine">home? The girl was in Dutch Schenectady,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if Cameron be alive and here. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ranger tried to push the thought from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, yet all the time telling himself that</seg><seg type="columnLine">should the big fellow die on the doorsill</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the abandoned cabin it would be charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the Iroquois.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had accepted his loss of the girl as</seg><seg type="columnLine">final till after the fight in the trail, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took it for granted his former friend had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to his death. Believing that, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted a bit of hope to grow up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart. But if intuition were right, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cameron were here. . . And again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavored to retreat deeper into the bush</seg><seg type="columnLine">and away from the horrible temptation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something in his soul shrieked out for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill the beastly thought, while louder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">louder his mad love dinned in his ears--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With Cameron dead you may win her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A figure began drawing toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway and a familiar coonskin cap</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged from the shadows, the cap Cam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eron wore the day Blanchard was killed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a loud groan Martin threw down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle and clenched his hands and thrust the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody opportunity from him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who's there?" asked a voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a gasp of incredulity Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled from cover and glared at the pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and sorrow-filled eyes of Betty Blan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chard. And she was wearing the cap Cam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eron had left behind when he ran up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail to check the onrush of the Iroquois.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Recognizing him she lowered the rifle she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had held in readiness, and demanded--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jo Martin, where's your friend, Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cameron?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He plucked at the fringe of his hunting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt and tried to find words.

He passed near</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to Fort Stanwix to hear the dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">pur-r-r of a drum, then turned south to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid the skulking savages he knew were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fringing the post. It was not till several</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from Stanwix and well within hostile</seg><seg type="columnLine">country that he became conscious of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">trailed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must have made his discovery sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciously, for one moment he was flitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a forest aisle, his heart in an ache for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrong he had done Betty Blanchard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the next he was behind a tree. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard nor seen nothing that he knew of;</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet the moment he was behind the tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was noiselessly working his way under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tangle of wild-grape vines and rejoicing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find his body slipping down a declivity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Completing the descent he found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a little gulley and at once started to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">along this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he deemed it prudent to emerge</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the gulley he took time to wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">why his tracker had not sounded an alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he mulled over this puzzling phase of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation an Indian brave suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped before him and raised an empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand in a token of well-meaning. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin could think to take the defensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">his startled eyes noted the painted Oneida</seg><seg type="columnLine">totem on the savage's chest, and in great</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief asked--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why does the Black Bear of the Oneidas</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow his white brother?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The white girl whose eyes are the color</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cornflower asked the Bear to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white man who dares walk alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Long House. The Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bear owes a life to the father of the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. He met her on the Mohawk. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">grows thin like a starved deer, and white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the first snow. She said -find and give</seg><seg type="columnLine">this talk to the white man who goes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the man Cameron." 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he spoke this in the Oneida tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">he produced from his paint-bag a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll of birchbark tied with a blue ribbon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Martin's heart skipped a beat at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the ribbon. In accepting it he read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words, "For Jas. Cameron," written</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a charred stick on the outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">H4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She sends this by me to Cameron?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Martin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the man Cameron, who now is held</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Onondaga," grunted the Oneida.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had hardly spoken before he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanishing into a tangle of bushes. Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaped blankly for a moment, the abrupt</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappearance preventing various queries</seg><seg type="columnLine">he desired to put. A soft kiss back of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him to the right-about, his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his ax. The Black Bear's visage showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment from beneath some under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush and he was pointing behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranger. Martin lost no time in taking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cue to efface himself, but it required several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes to locate the danger, a dusky form</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping from tree to tree. Farther back</seg><seg type="columnLine">were other forms. He had the Oneida</seg><seg type="columnLine">to thank for escaping a surprise attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Securing the roll of bark in his belt he</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated all his cunning on escaping.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was convinced there were but a handful</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the enemy, else there would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loud outcry and an attempt to encircle</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Returning to the gulley he utilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">its cover for a hot sprint. When a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn-out yell warned him the Iroquois</seg><seg type="columnLine">had discovered where he descended to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulley he climbed the bank and struck off</seg><seg type="columnLine">at top speed toward the eastern end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oneida Lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had now penetrated well behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of warriors surrounding Stanwix</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every stride was plunging him deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Iroquois country. But given his</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberty until night and he believed the odds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in his favor; for he was on familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and had various hiding-places. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was growing dusk when he caught the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">lap-lap of the lake and knew the race was</seg><seg type="columnLine">won. At no time during his flight had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpsed Black Bear of the Oneida Bear clan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR years a wooden structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">known as the Royal Blockhouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood at this end of the lake. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had withstood many Indian assaults but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more than a decade had been abandoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by troops and left to the elements. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">early morning mists were rising in tenuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapes from the lake, suggesting quadrilles</seg><seg type="columnLine">by ghosts, when Martin peered through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loop-hole and studied the silent woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Satisfied no enemy was lurking behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest screen he passed the open door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its silken barrier of spider-webs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded to the end of the building nearest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake. Here he removed a section of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">log, cunningly prepared for such an emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gency, and passed into the sweet air. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicket of saplings concealed him as he rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet, and the grove extended to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore of the lake. Stealing to the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranger spread his blanket on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disrobed to the waist, hung a trade</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror before him and emptied a paint-bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his crossed legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The brushes of bark he made more pliable</seg><seg type="columnLine">by chewing them. Next he mixed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">paints and proceeded to transform himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">into an aborigine. On his breast he</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted a Cayuga totem, a bear standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect, the clan of the bear being common</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the tribes of the Long House. Although</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had utilized his cache of paints in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blockhouse more than once for turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself into a savage it required time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience to hack off his long hair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">partially shave his head. But when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished Jo Martin, ranger, was gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dancing Black Bear, Cayuga, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that he was ready for the final test</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his scheme his courage weakened. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he feared for himself, for he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone to the stake if by so doing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could fully atone for the black thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had harbored. He worried lest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oneida's intelligence was wrong, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cameron had been put to death at Gaya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaanhe. The success of his bizarre scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded that his rival be at Onondaga,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the Great Council-Fire ever burned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So for once his heart grew glad when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered Indians approaching from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of Stanwix. He knew they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying to Onondaga and that only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">errand could call them there--to enjoy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacle of a white man put to the torture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As they moved in a course parallel to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as there was no danger of their crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trail he secured a vantage-point and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched them. They were Mohawks, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">filed by with the precision of a machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with no more noise than a snake would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make. One warrior carried two scalps</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched on hoops, and the ranger knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">these trophies were furnished by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers killed a few days before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout the long afternoon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the stars of early evening the painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man hung to the heels of the Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawks. When the glow of fires bloomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">rosily ahead he knew the great adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">A New Keeper of the Wampum</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">115</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to be staged; for he was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outskirts of dread Onondaga. A loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">chorus of welcome was given the Mohawks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as though the man Cameron's ordeal</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been postponed till this arrival, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">next rose a monotonous chanting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Confident because of his paint and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscurity of the night Martin glided closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gained a position near the great bark</seg><seg type="columnLine">council-house and crouched in some bushes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The council-house stood on a gentle slope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlooking the place of torture. An old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, the hereditary keeper of the wampum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the doorway awaiting the spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacle, his slight figure sharply outlined by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flaming torch in the wall behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Groups of warriors were congregating</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the torture-stake and the ring of fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding, but not touching it. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming circle contained the calendar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cameron's mortal life; for the ranger knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rival would be brought forth when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing fire had subsided into beds of coals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving his long rifle in the brush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin dropped his blanket from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and allowed it to hang from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">loins. Then he struck boldly into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. The Mohawk who carried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scalps taken at Stanwix gave him greeting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the ranger returned and passed on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Mohawk, without suspecting the truth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impelled to follow him. Martin dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned this much and came to a halt as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though waiting to enjoy the preliminaries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every nerve was strung as taut as the cord</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a war bow as he fancied himself in danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">of discovery even before he could fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter upon his project.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had no time to give to finesse if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to make a try for Cameron's life, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">already the flames were shortening and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge of coals climbing higher. Groups of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the various tribes were steadily growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger, Seneca, Onondaga, Cayuga and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mohawk. Now the groups extended and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in contact, forming a large and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pact body. Wizened hags were coursing</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth in a frenzy of blood-lusting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and contributing the only note of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He killed my son at Oriskany! Let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">fondle him! Let me play with him!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieked the leader of the witch band.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cry was caught up and tossed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fiendish gusto. Despite the warmth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the night Martin felt chilly, for he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been with Cameron at Oriskany.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The warriors held themselves in dignified</seg><seg type="columnLine">restraint, although their eyes glittered</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly as dry fuel was thrown on various</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires to illuminate the scene. Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched the assemblage closely and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieved at not beholding Walter Butler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tutelary devil to the Senecas. A warrior</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the ranger grunted loudly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smacked his lips in satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following the direction of his gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin trembled at beholding the tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">superb figure of Cameron advancing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">an aisle of warriors, stripped to the buff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms fastened behind his back. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">blond head was held high, but the dew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death glistened on his forehead. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes narrowed at sight of the stake and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring of coals discredited his manhood none.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two warriors walked beside him, holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by the arms to prevent his drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. With a sudden twist of his massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders he shunted these aside, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady step continued his approach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho! Ho!" resounded in approval from</seg><seg type="columnLine">many throats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man comes to die!" cried an aged</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho! Ho! A man comes to die!" The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce shout rolled down the valley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the black arches of the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mohawk with the scalps pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to obtain a better view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entertainment. Martin edged toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">council-house. Again the Mohawk felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague misgiving tainting his pleasure, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took a step after the masquerader.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whereat Martin gutturally cried:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho! Ho! We owe the brave man</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mohawk halted and resumed watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the prisoner. As a preface to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more exquisite torture a young brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized one of Cameron's hands and thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">a finger deep into the bowl of a lighted pipe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With no betrayal of pain the prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared complacently over the heads of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">captors for a moment, then kicked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him and hurled his tormentor into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yells of joy greeted the warrior's dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfiture, as gasping for breath he crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the fiery mass like a scorched snake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin felt a twinge of the old comradeship</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm his blood; and within himself he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Fore God, he's a brave man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho!

The latter could not rid</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself of the feeling that the Cayuga was</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting in a peculiar manner in withdrawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the delectable spectacle. Martin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, could not afford to waste another</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute; and being in the shadows he ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly to the rear of the council-house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew the Mohawk was following him</seg><seg type="columnLine">but did not stay his steps till at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shed, in which the Onondagas stored</seg><seg type="columnLine">their Winter's wood and war supplies for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the league.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why does my brother come here when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man is about to die?" challenged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mohawk, placing a heavy hand on Martin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a swing of his ax Martin felled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifeless, and grunted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right, my nosey friend. A man has</seg><seg type="columnLine">died."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rolling the body under a bush he entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shed and after stumbling over some logs</seg><seg type="columnLine">found what he knew was always stored</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Picking up a keg he groped through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness to the door opening into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">council-house. Throwing this back he sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the long passageway till he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the torch-light. There he</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposited the keg on the floor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper of the wampum sensed his presence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, turning, discovered him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go out!" the sachem angrily com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded. "You can not bring rum here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And pointed to the keg. "Has the Cayuga's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears grown so thick he never heard that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wampum of the Six Nations is kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Martin bowed meekly before the rebuke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and picking up the keg advanced as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave by the front door, only on reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door he quickly closed it. Stupefied</seg><seg type="columnLine">by such behavior the aged guardian blinked</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolishly for a few moments, then sought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry out. A blanket dropped over his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smothered him. He was dazed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time Martin finished tying him up. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranger next knocked the head from the keg,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then taking the torch began searching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various apartments opening off the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">passageway. In the third room he entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found what he so eagerly desired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STHE night was hideous with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible din of the blood-mad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The screaming hags were fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">ike demons to get at the prisoner, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have spoiled the play prematurely</seg><seg type="columnLine">if not held back by force. Cameron's feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hobbled with a small chain. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">two warriors, protecting themselves against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heat with robes of green hide, dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the edge of the coals and forced him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a sitting posture. The heat scorched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bare flesh. Cameron's eyes became</seg><seg type="columnLine">distended and his tongue worked des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately to find moisture in his dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This slow baking process, continued for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some minutes, was so cunningly regulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to do the victim no serious harm, albeit</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflicting exquisite pain. At last one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torturers, as though moved by compassion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">held out a small kettle of water while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other yanked Cameron to his feet. Cam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eron greedily lunged his head forward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure a mouthful. The warrior snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">it back, drank heartily and poured what</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained on to the ground. This bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">play, a mere preliminary to the real and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasting agony, was greeted with prolonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">howls of approval. Cameron bit his hps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and braced his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho! Ho!" roared the onlookers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the prisoner was forced close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coals, this time so near that his flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to shrivel. Then he was drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">back a pace and another brave offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him water. Cameron ignored the kettle</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it was pressed almost against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, when his suffering drove him to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more. This time he was permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bury his mouth in the fluid only to jerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">back his head with a groan of pain. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scalding hot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho! Ho! The white man does not like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drink of the Iroquois," exulted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A crescendo of fiendish approval lasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for nearly a minute and was only stilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the deep voice of the master of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremonies called for silence. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signal for the torture to begin in</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest. Two braves seized the victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made a chain fast about his waist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared to hurl him inside the glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle. The stake, a large sapling trimmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its branches, was sizzling as the heat dried</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the oozing sap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The savage spectators glared expectantly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A New Keeper of the Wampum</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Even the brood of hags ceased their clamor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now was come the real test between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner's defiant bearing and the resources</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Iroquois. It was to be a duel, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Indians ever loved to witness;</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrinking flesh and raw nerves against all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devices for inflicting physical suffering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diabolism of the Long House could put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in practise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the chain was firmly fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Cameron's waist the warriors bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">their knees and made ready to hurl him</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the fatal ring. From the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">side a brave drew a long breath and leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hurdle of coals to catch the slack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chain and make it secure about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stake.

As he held it above his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spectators glared incredulously. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors holding Cameron released him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gape in amazement, and he worked back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the fierce heat unrebuked. A new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unthinkable climax had been thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What so miraculously dropped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">velvet heavens was a wampum belt, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that, one the Iroquois recognized as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cherished possession of the federated tribes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was seven rows of beads wide and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred beads long. It contained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of a man at one end and a cross at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other, both in white against a dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, and connected by a single row of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white beads. There was none who did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">identify it as a French belt, the markings</seg><seg type="columnLine">recording the great distance the envoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled in order to present his "talk" to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Long House.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the reasons for the envoy's coming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as "talked" by him into the wampum, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known only to the hereditary keeper of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wampum. It was in wampum that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Six Nations recorded their speeches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">treaties, laws, tribal and intertribal history.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the last step before hieroglyphics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and perhaps on a par with and yet more</seg><seg type="columnLine">subtle than picture-writing. The pattern</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the beads associated the sign or object</seg><seg type="columnLine">with some historical fact or epochal idea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore the office of the hereditary keeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">was semi-sacred and its inviolability was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be maintained at all costs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While each savage mind was struggling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to find an explanation for the belt flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the night there rang out a mocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice up the slope, the words falling like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack of a whip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho! Ho! A white man comes to trade!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">it proclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an inarticulate, primitive cry of rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Iroquois emerged from their stupor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho! Ho!" continued the mocking voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who trades for kanasa (wampum)?

He had come around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house from the west side.

Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can see them," Jimmy said. He sigaed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy to follow him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They may shoot you!" cried Winifred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't go up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't show myself more than I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">help," he assured her.

Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized it. He was about to mount the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder, with Billy to support it, when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to him that he would better have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peep at Kaufman first. He tiptoed to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, and pushed the slide back gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the imperial envoy had been signaling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to any one he was not at this moment so</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged. He was at his southeast window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock still, and muttering to himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, with curious silences intervening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he watched, Jimmy saw Kaufman nod</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself, and raise his hand. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a towel in it. He reached his arm through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bars, and went through a sequence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">motions--up and down, and from side to</seg><seg type="columnLine">side in, it appeared, some sort of pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">established order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy closed the slide and returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy. He told him what he had seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wig-wagging!" the boy exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's army training for you! I bet it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neiderlein talking to him. We ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop it, Jimmy. Kaufman is telling him</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let Brewer know," Jimmy bade him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I can manage to get up here, I reckon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a fall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy ran off. Jimmy climbed the ladder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lifted a wing of the skylight until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could push his head through the opening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ladder wobbled crazily under him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he clutched at the skylight casing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save himself. Then, of a sudden, he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">his footing firmer. The ladder was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadied from below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am holding it," said a voice. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winifred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy looked down at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you," he returned. "I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a mess of it. Billy told you about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. He and father are planning some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Do be careful up there. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let them see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think they can. I won't keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">you long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rested his elbows on the coaming and</seg><seg type="columnLine">conned the coffee field and the adjoining</seg><seg type="columnLine">122</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wood with the binocular. If Kaufman</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ceased his signaling there would in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">likelihood be a response unless--and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was possible--the minister's message was</seg><seg type="columnLine">final. In such case no one would show him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in the open, Jimmy decided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you see any one?" Winifred called</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lowered the glass as he replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a soul. They've done talking, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time anyway. I think I'll come down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ha! Wait a minute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had put the glass to his eyes for a last</seg><seg type="columnLine">look. Something moved in the field of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision--an animal of sofne kind, he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first, skulking in the brush at the verge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the woods. It was moving away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees in a line that would take it along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the hill and in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ravine. Jimmy revised his initial</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's no four-footed beast," he mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A SMALL clear space amid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes lay in the path of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowler. Jimmy centered his gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it. The thing came to it, and darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">across. It was a man, bent double and</seg><seg type="columnLine">running. He was immediately swallowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the farther bushes. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germans, of course. Any one on a peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able errand would not act in this way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy turned his glass to the woods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If there were others following he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know how many. But nothing stirred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He swept the coffee field again; there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no movement in it. The man was lost to</seg><seg type="columnLine">view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of hammering jarred the still-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. It startled Jimmy. He drew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in from the skylight and questioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winifred. She was holding the ladder with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid arms, bracing it against his sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift of balance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it--that noise?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Father and Billy are nailing Herr Kauf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's shutters up. A board on the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Incommunicado. Fine!" He started</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. "Well, I saw the chap. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">running toward the ravine. There are no</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, or at any rate they didn't show</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves." He stood beside her now</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor. "Thank you for your help."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She waved it aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we are to succeed each must help</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he can. Why was the man running</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ravine? Can you guess? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he want there if they came over on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge? They can't bring the caracross."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is what I'd like to know," rejoined</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy. "It couldn't be that only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them tried the bridge. And yet if all</seg><seg type="columnLine">came why is that fellow heading for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hammering started up again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Kaufman's room proceeded harsh cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of. expostulation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are three windows," commented</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winifred. "They are at the second."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy was thinking of that skulking</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure in the bushes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'm going to see what he's up to," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced. "No, not Herr Kaufman; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can hear what he's up to," he laughed. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that other Hun. I am going down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the river."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He ran into the living-room and picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his revolver from the table. Winifred</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed him to the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Do you think it wise?" she asked. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were troubled. "Because you saw only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one man it doesn't indicate that he is alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The others may be waiting for him. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">may fall into a trap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," he argued, "we decided, didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">we, that if they had come by the bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be nothing to call them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine--not while the water is high."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't know what to say," she answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an anxious frown. "Only it seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that you are running a risk with no</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage to be gained. It seems to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that our part is to wait for what may</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen. We are on the defensive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, but if I can find out what is doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down there we shall be doubly armed. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what the other fellow is going to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he does it is some advantage, isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?" He smiled at her whimsically. "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep both eyes open, one in front and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">' behind. He won't catch me asleep, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She said nothing. She saw that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent on going, and she stepped aside from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. He paused and held out his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Will you wish me luck, Winifred?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was the second time that he had called</seg><seg type="columnLine">her by her given name, yet she showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no resentment. She accepted it as a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition of the strange intimacy in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">events had placed them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall watch for you to come back,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said simply, and let her hand rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly in his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had left the house and was crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fringe of trees on the brow of the hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he heard her call to him--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Perry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned. She sat at a window of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living-room. She had drawn to one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shutters, and had paused with the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you have trouble fire a shot," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned a step or two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was clear," he said.

He was ten yards from her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded him with a detached air, as might</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who is asked to solve a complex problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly presented. In the stress of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time that was upon them he had stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this--a token of an assured friendship</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could never be. How should she</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer him? The solution was as old as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mother Eve. She said, speaking gravely</seg><seg type="columnLine">and distinctly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you get into trouble, Jimmy, fire a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot to let us know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shutter closed.

A smile was on his lips, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not of triumph; it went deeper than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXVI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT DIEGO FOUND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KAUFMAN, in a supreme access of rage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had emptied his water pitcher on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer and Billy as they were nailing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last of the three windows; and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">applied epithets to them in his own tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Billy in common decency had refrained</seg><seg type="columnLine">from interpreting to Brewer. The latter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, sensed the reason for his silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going in to speak to this fellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued his animadversions to Billy, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a way of his own, brought to pass what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer had failed to do. He compelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the German to employ his English in self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He says," Billy reported to Brewer with</seg><seg type="columnLine">nice enunciation, "that his eyes are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, and he appreciates the darkening</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room for him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is not so! It is a lie!" bellowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diplomat. He shook a furious finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the recreant youth.

He had been quick to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the shutter peepholes he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">still signal to his people. But now! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">image of the black Goliath rose before him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chilled his blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think that's all," Brewer added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at Billy, and they moved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. Kaufman called to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"A moment! I have friends at hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will save yourselves from harm if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stop where you are in this outrage. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">store me to liberty, and my friends will go</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. You have my official word for it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer contemplated him with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely interested air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your official word, you say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jal"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A promise in the Kaiser's name?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Ja! Ja!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brewer swung to his heel, and drew open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," he said to Billy. "He offers</seg><seg type="columnLine">us only brass."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the roar of a maddened bull Kauf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man hurled himself at them. Billy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing back of Brewer in the room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped aside and stuck out a foot. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">representative of Imperial Germany came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in a most democratic sprawl. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not hurt, they saw; he was only wofully</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped of his bravado and breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy grinned at Brewer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shall we go now?" he suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For answer Brewer motioned him out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bolted the door. Winifred came run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning from her room to meet them. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard the crash of Kaufman's fall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What was it?"-she inquired anxiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"An overturned chair," Brewer told her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She knew it was an evasion to quiet her</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm, and it pleased her. She did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">press the question, and they went together</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the living-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is Jimmy?" Billy queried. "Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the roof all this time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She recounted what had taken place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told Sam to let us know if he heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot," she ended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brewer looked grave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't like it," he said. "It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish thing to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy, who could entertain the adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an alluring light, did not agree with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he would not contradict him openly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It wouldn't be a bad thing to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how many we've got to handle," he ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced. "What I can't make out is why</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dickens they don't come at us. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to prevent. What's holding them</seg><seg type="columnLine">off? Maybe Jimmy can tell us when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some one knocked at the shutters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">east window. Winifred had closed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all when Jimmy left. Brewer crossed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window and reconnoitered the outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Sam, and with him was Tio Diego.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer threw open the shutters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam pointed to the peasant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dere's somethin' he got on his min',</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boss, an' I kain't make head er tail on it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If dey'd only speak so's people could</seg><seg type="columnLine">un'erstan' w'at dey's aimin' at it'd save er</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap er trubbel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DIEGO shrugged hopelessly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that Brewer's Spanish was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of verbal shreds and tatters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his daughter's was but little better.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But--as Billy appeared--here was a Chris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian who could speak the language of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blessed saints, if not with the entire ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellence of one born and cradled in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He erupted into a passionate recital, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which shoulders, hands, and every facial</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle took a part. Billy stopped him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to time to translate to the others. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance Diego's story was this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had gone to his hut for tobacco to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make cigarets. He got to thinking of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old footbridge at the south end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine; it seemed that what he had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it to the Americans was considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">important. He decided to go and see if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He followed an old, little-known trail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it was the short way to the bridge. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">led across the Santa Marta road, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">again into the forest until it brought up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the ravine. One could, of course, follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream from the ford, but that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long way around and the more difficult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, when finally he came out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river there was no bridge. It had gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was some wreckage of it on the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it had torn away from its anchorage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the bridge itself was not there. He ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined the wreckage, and the fractures were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh. He looked about him. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambling muddy marks on the rocks--</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite fresh--and back a little were foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prints in the soft earth. A man's--one</seg><seg type="columnLine">only--one single man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was easy now to tell what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. The bridge was old, it was weak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was rotten. And the storm had shaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The man started over on it. He was half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way when it began to give. It was as safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">to advance as to retreat. He went on, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the grace of his patron saint reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank and threw himself down on it as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge broke and fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was all. Diego had followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">footprints a few rods. The man was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">north along the river. Diego had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">125</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back and hurried home to tell what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy took from his pocket one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver dollars he had extracted from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctant Whittaker and handed it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diego. He commended him for what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done, and bade him stay close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house for the rest of the day. They might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have need of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we have learned that there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one man on this side," said Winifred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The others must have gone back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford on the opposite side as they came."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A little sigh of relief, of which she herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unaware, escaped her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder if it was Neiderlein who got</seg><seg type="columnLine">across?" speculated Billy. "It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader's job, and he is the legation head</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the absence of Kaufman. Huh, Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take care of him all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He helped himself to a cigar from the box</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the table, and sat down. Brewer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pacing the room meditatively. Winifred</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained by the window, looking out. Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">had resumed his patrol of the grounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer halted abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say, Winny, that Perry was to fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shot if he met with trouble?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. He promised to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was his plan? He must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know, father. He said he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to find out what the man was up to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not ask him how he hoped to do it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes went to the watch on her wrist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He has been gone thirty-two minutes."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This scrupulous exactitude brought an</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd glance from her father. Even Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned his head and regarded her inquisi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively. But she was not conscious of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny. Her gaze was on the out-of-doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, her attitude alert and tense. Brewer</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at her a second time, and took up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his walk about the room. The minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged by. Billy put his cigar aside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred uneasily in his chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound it," he rapped out, "this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting on my nerves. It's like waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner when you've got to catch a train.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's gone an hour, hasn't he, Miss Wini-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fred?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes." Her voice was sharp and short.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I could crawl to the river and back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time," grumbled Billy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got up and began handling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mausers stacked in a comer, going over</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to see if all were loaded, though he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">knew well that they were, having seen to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself with Jimmy. But he was restless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted action, any demand on him but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grinding requirement of passive expec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The difficulty is," said Brewer out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence he had been wrapped in, "that if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires a shot it will be hard to locate it</seg><seg type="columnLine">accurately. Sound is deceptive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm betting he don't have to fire,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy argued. "Jimmy can take care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. He'll be back all smiling. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just this darned waiting that hurts."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winifred left the window. She walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutely past the two to the door. Brewer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes followed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are you going, Winny?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To my room. I am tired," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">without looking at him, and went out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brewer's gaze remained fastened on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty doorway. His expression was som-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber. Billy abandoned the guns and spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. He turned with a quick intake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now that she is gone, what do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of it, sir?" Billy asked. "That bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have knocked together some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a raft, you know, and come across. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not impossible. And Jimmy may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled right into them without being able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fire his gun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was thinking of that," Brewer admitted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And, Billy, if it's so what can we do?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've been thinking of that also. They will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be coming here. They are five at least,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps six--the car was filled with men--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if either of us go it will leave only two</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold the house. We can't count on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diego; he has no real interest in us. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winifred--she is brave, but after all a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. If they should break in--well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are Germans!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no! We can't take that chance!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried the boy. "Jimmy would be the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">to damn us if we did. We--we will just</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to wait, Mr. Brewer. We've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They tried to settle down to it quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the task was too hard for them. Brewer</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose from his chair and began pacing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor again. Then Billy bounced to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm going to the roof. Maybe I'll see</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. Anything is better than this."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer steadied the ladder for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy did not stop on the last rung; he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself up to the tiles, and stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">126</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scanning the country with the binocular.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer stepped to Winifred's door. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked, but there was no response. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened it, and looked in. She was lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bed, her face in the pillows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Winny!" he called softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did not answer. He would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached her in this way, she knew, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had news to tell. He lingered a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">voiceless, then closed the door and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brewer waited by the ladder for Billy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face was contorted with pain, the pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bites deeper than any bodily ill. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was roused by Billy's foot on the ladder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Could you see anything of them?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioned wearily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not a sign." When he was down he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said brokenly: "Mr. Brewer, it--it's getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be more than I can stand. They have</seg><seg type="columnLine">got Jimmy--I know it--and we can't do a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy dropped on a chair and covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brimming eyes with his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE ENEMY'S HANDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE were two courses Jimmy could</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursue in his hunt for the man he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen from the housetop. One was to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceed openly down the drive on the east side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hill to the Santa Marta Road, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow it leisurely to the ravine as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were merely curious to see the stage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, and was without suspicion of enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other was to go down the north side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hill, and through the scrub to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. From there he could work east along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank. The boldness of the first ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pealed to him, but as he thought on it he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that the man he sought would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be likely to show himself if he saw any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching on the public highway. Either</seg><seg type="columnLine">that or, if there were others with him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be ambushed and taken prisoner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He decided on the second course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was slow going down the rocky hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the thorny scrub, and it was hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribly hot; but he won through and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the dense thickets on the ravine</seg><seg type="columnLine">brink. The water, he noted, was falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly though it was still a boiling flood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed at the thought he had enter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tained of swimming it; he had never ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired distinction in the art, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded skill as well as strength. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked his way heedfully in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Santa Marta Road, and came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally on a little jut of clear ground just</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the pitch of the road to the ford. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was screened from the river by a growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ironwood bushes and twining sarsaparilla,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but on the road side there was nothing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered stand-up concealment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy threw himself flat and crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the brim. Some one directly below</seg><seg type="columnLine">was calling across the stream. Answering</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices came, and the language was German.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy wanted to find out how many men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on this side and how many on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. By worming carefully to the verge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tiny precipice he could see around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen of bushes, he thought, and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">look down also on the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A luxuriant flowering plant that he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know swayed outward from the verge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its large glossy leaves, raised tier on tier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would afford him protection. He crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it, gained it--and clutched at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly. The overshot edge of ground, weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened by the rain, was giving way. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to save himself by a backward flop;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the leverage was gone. He came down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the road sliding on his shoulder head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost in a porridge of mud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The devil!" he spurted out in angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismay, and repeated it--"The devil take</seg><seg type="columnLine">it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shout rose from the opposite bank. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice near at hand spoke in hard English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So! You could not wait for us to come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, we have one less to deal with. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not move!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Sub-Lieutenant Karl Hecht of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arraca, and he was alone. None of his men</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on this side. A cold smile played on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his blond features, and in his hand as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">explored Jimmy's pockets was an unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument pf swift destruction. That he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would shoot if resistance was offered Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You win the first round," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's in my right-hand pocket, what you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The exploring fingers came away not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only with his revolver, but with his card-</seg><seg type="columnLine">case and the letters that were in his breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get up!" ordered his captor. "Step off</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right, to that tree over there."</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">127</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy obeyed. Hecht followed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely. They plunged through a serried</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth of brush off the road and came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tree. The spot commanded a view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ford and the Germans on the other side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were four of them. They were watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him, Jimmy could see, but they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry out any more. This man evidently was</seg><seg type="columnLine">their leader. Was he Neiderlein?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hecht pointed to a flat stone in the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade of the tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down," he directed. For himself he</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected the base of the tree with the trunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a back. They were well-curtained from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road. Hecht was guarding against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance interference. He looked into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">card-case, fingered the banknotes it con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained, and tossed it over to Jimmy. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other matter he examined with care. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were letters from home and the two cable-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grams from Perry, Sr. He read them all</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sedulous attention, lifting a wary</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye frequently to his vis-a-vis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy could make no protest at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny of his intimate affairs. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected grimly that he was a prisoner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">war, in precisely the situation that he him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self had placed the Imperial German minis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. He had, it was true, refrained from</seg><seg type="columnLine">going through Kaufman's pockets, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a weak obedience to scruples that war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fare took no account of. He could claim no</seg><seg type="columnLine">indulgence for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another thought came to Jimmy. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than a prisoner of war--he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spy. And spies were dealt with summarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a state of war. Here was a small off-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot of the great conflict in which his</seg><seg type="columnLine">country was involved, and it was he who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had promoted it. By the rules of the game</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could expect no leniency from his foe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He secretly surveyed the man by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree. He was of his own build, and wiry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hard as nails. Without the gun laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">handily at his side he would be a tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">customer to tackle, though this to Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been no deterrent; even odds</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all he asked. If only that gun. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hecht spoke to him. He had finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">his perusal of the letters. They contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of moment to him, but he decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep them. He flipped one of the cable-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grams with his finger before stowing it away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too slow--eh, Perry--going home to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enlist? You did it here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am of an impatient nature," Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered placidly. He did not intend to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">let this Hun rag him, whatever came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have the advantage of me," he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued. "Do you prefer to have me address</seg><seg type="columnLine">you as X, or as a definite quantity?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The German considered the request.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The humor of it passed him by; he saw only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the practical side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lieutenant Hecht of the Imperial Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serves," he replied bruskly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy raised his brows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I had thought you were that fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neiderlein. You got across on the bridge, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. Why didn't your men come with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It broke. I made it just in time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was a pity," commented Jimmy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went on leaving the other to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remark as he would--"If I am not too in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quisitive, Lieutenant Hecht, I would like</seg><seg type="columnLine">further information--now that you've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">me what are you going to do with me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HECHT did not answer. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention was directed to the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the river. One of them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the water's edge looking out over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current. He turned to his companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made an affirmative sign.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If he's thinking of swimming it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy said conversationally to Hecht,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"he'd better go up a way. He'd have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of landing here then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lieutenant regarded him with a glim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer of interest. This American was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily disturbed, it appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are the one who carried off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Excellency last night," he accused suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Am I? Thank you for acquainting me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it." Jimmy bowed to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why did you do it?" demanded Hecht.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, just for a joke," rejoined Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">carelessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The German's look grew black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wished to know what I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do with you," he spat out. "One of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">things--exchange you for his Excellency, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy felt the blood crowd back on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, for he was convinced that the threat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not an idle one. Hecht meant it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">to surrender Kaufman to save his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin was a thing he would not do. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously, in a lightning flash there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">limned in his mind the thin, stooped form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer, the expatriate, his hand lifted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flag, his voice challenging as he cried out--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let them come and haul it down!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">128</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy smiled palely as he replied to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teuton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not find either proposition agree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, Mr. Lieutenant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will be one or the other," Hecht</seg><seg type="columnLine">asserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That," returned Jimmy evenly, "is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your affair. I am done with it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is for your friends to say," jeered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hecht. "I shall submit it to them with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assurance that if they do not accede I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">execute you in plain view of them. After-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward we will take his Excellency anyway."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not alive. I will bet with you on that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make it ten to one in your favor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hecht stared at him, grunted something</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his own tongue, and lapsed into silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy had stuffed some cigars in his pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">before leaving the house. They were broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly, but he found one that was yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">smokable, lit it, and with his hands clasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily about his knee puffed away with as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed indifference to his fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though the day was well advanced--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was four o'clock--the heat was growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of diminishing with the declining</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. It was a still, dry, suffocating heat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">settling down like a vast blanket over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. To Jimmy it seemed as if there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a portent of evil in it, though this, perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be attributed to his mental state.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His gaze wandered to the opposite rim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ravine. No one of the Germans was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. His gaze came back to Hecht. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still staring at him. Now he asked:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So you took me for Herr Neiderlein?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you not know him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am happy to say that I do not."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then why did you take me for him?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We rather looked for him, that's all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We thought his man Landeker, who came</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning, had given him such a glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">report of our hospitality that Neiderlein</seg><seg type="columnLine">would want a taste of it himself. I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was Landeker who posted you on the lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the land out here, or--" Jimmy ventured</seg><seg type="columnLine">a random shot--"was it my esteemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend "and proclaimed countrywoman, Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary Taylor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy fancied he saw a change in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolid face of the man, but if Hecht intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reply it was cut off by a hail from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. The Germans were swimming down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of them, in fact, was landing at a spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the tree. Hecht stood up. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">flipped the sweat from his forehead with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse at the heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You sit still or the birds will pick your</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones on that rock," he growled at Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first German came up steaming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, for the enveloping heat had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready seized on him. In five minutes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be dry as tinder, pistol, cartridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt and all. Hecht uttered a command,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the man went off into the brush. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">others came up one by one, big, burly</seg><seg type="columnLine">customers. Hecht put a question to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after a general searching of pockets one</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced a length of whipcord. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">man returned. He held in his hand a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth, straight, freshly cut stick about</seg><seg type="columnLine">two feet long, and an inch thick. Hecht</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressed the group briefly. From an</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional gesture in the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hacienda Jimmy judged that he was out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lining a plan of assault.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Hecht finished, and two of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped over to the stone where Jimmy sat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One was the man with the stick, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other the man with the cord. Jimmy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse drummed in his ears, and his jaws set</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a vise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand up you, Perry!" Hecht ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a brutal tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy jumped up with a suddenness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a straight out from the shoulder right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left that sent the two men reeling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went for Hecht. No thought of the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hecht held restrained him--he but wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach the fellow and beat him down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dirt. But instead he went down him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. One of the other men had leaped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and clinched in a mighty embrace they</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled on the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five minutes later Jimmy, dazed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding, was raised to his feet. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not get up by himself, for through the hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low of his drawn back arms a stick was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust, and his hands were forced together</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of him and pinioned with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">braided whipcord. A hammer blow could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have budged the stick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hecht did not give him a glance. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent a man on ahead to scout the road,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after an interval the party followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hecht led. A man was on each side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy, and roughly helped him through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brush. A third man brought up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear. In this wise they came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hacienda gate. The fifth man joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">them here. They turned off to the left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sheltered by the scrub in the coffee</seg><seg type="columnLine">field made their way toward the woods on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south of the house. Jimmy could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the flag on the roof drooping lifelessly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the baking air. His heart swelled at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what Jimmy could not see was Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched in the skylight opening sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approaches to the house with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">binocular. It was the third time he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone up there since Jimmy left, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous time bringing only a sickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of utter futility. Now, though, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he mechanically quartered the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, his glass caught a movement far</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in the corner of the field. He waited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely breathing, until in another space</seg><seg type="columnLine">he descried the advancing party. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted the news to Brewer in a queer high</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've found them! They are making for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woods. They are going to come at us</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that side."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a pause. Winifred had run</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from her room at the sound of his shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry. She stood at her father's side by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladder, her hands clasped to her breast. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">groan broke from the boy above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They've got Jimmy! He's in the midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. There's something wrong with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. God, I see now! His arms are tied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A rifle, Mr. Brewer. I'll shoot--no, no.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might hit Jimmy. And they are gone!</seg><seg type="columnLine">They've reached the woods."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HECHT kept just within the shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trees so that he could hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house in view. It brought him</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently to Tio Diego's hut. The old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the act of scurrying from the place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A call from Hecht, and a leveled pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him back. He was trembling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his toes, and when he saw Jimmy, bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">and begrimed, his seamed face went the</seg><seg type="columnLine">color of lead. Hecht motioned him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hut. The others remained outside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy noticed that they placed themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lee of him, and he understood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason; they were using him as a shield</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the shuttered, silent house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Hecht came out shortly. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrawled a note in pencil on the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of Jimmy's envelopes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may care to hear this," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">harshly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He read what he had written.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the name of the Imperial German Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment I demand the surrender of his Excellency,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herr Adolph Kaufman, the Imperial Minister to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">State of Zanhoria.

Never--</seg><seg type="columnLine">never-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hecht struck him in the mouth with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">open hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A JOURNEY FOR TWO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FTER Don Luis left him Enrique sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many minutes pondering what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had learned. All the inflammatory passions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his nature were in a seething turmoil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally he got up and sought his own room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dressed for the street, and departed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the house in his car. He drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight to Ortega's office in the Calle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Central. Ortega was not there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," he muttered as he drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. "I should have known. Good God,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how hot it is!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drove east until he reached the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirts of the city. Before him rose a tower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing adobe wall. Barely peeping above it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the eaves of a great oblong building</seg><seg type="columnLine">of solid stone. It was the State prison.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Backed to that encircling adobe wall many</seg><seg type="columnLine">a political offendant had faced a firing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">squad in years past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the gate an armed sentry stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from the guard-house and stopped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car. Segovia made his name and errand</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, and after telephonic communication</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the prison the man informed him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could proceed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not the general office he was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived in. The room was evidently set</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart for a specific purpose. It was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare except for a thick matting on the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few plain chairs, and a large flat desk by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window. Ortega sat at this desk. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with a notebook in his hand was leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room by a door opposite that through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Segovia was ushered in. Beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">130</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the desk, in the comer, was placed a screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind which was a table for the man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the notebook when an interview was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretly recorded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ortega greeted Segovia with an incurious</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. He had surmised his errand when</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name was telephoned from the gate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said, in his calm, unemotional way:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, she is here. Your uncle has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking with you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Segovia nodded. For the time he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find no words. He remained standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the desk. The other's leisurely</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny of him brought the red to his brow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Emilio was, of course, thinking of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool's part he had played.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He told you, I presume," pursued</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ortega with a reflective air, "that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Isaacs who sent the note about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wireless; that it was Mrs. Isaacs who</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned from Morales who stole the Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington dispatch; that it was Mrs. Isaacs</seg><seg type="columnLine">who planned with his Excellency, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American minister, the little affair in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolores Street; that, in brief, it is Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isaacs, suspected by none of us, who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">enabled the Government to nip this plot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bring the plotters to justice.

And then what? What had</seg><seg type="columnLine">he in his heart to do? His fingers worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasantly, like claws; his lips curled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back from his teeth; his body stiffened</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the rigidity of a wild beast about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ortega was Latin himself, and he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signs. They did not revolt him; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt indeed a current of sympathy for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boy; but his years and training--more the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter than the former--had taught him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the folly of playing to his passions. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why anticipate? She will be shot with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the others."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She is to be shot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Enrique's fingers slackened. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a relaxation in all his body. The moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he could have killed Mary Taylor</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his own hands; now he was suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleansed of the desire in the flood of a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion. What in his unreasoning madness</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed an act of righteous retribution, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cold light of Ortega's announcement</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood out solely as a base personal revenge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After all, Mary Taylor had simply worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her country's behalf as Mrs. Isaacs had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked in behalf of hers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She is to be shot!" he repeated dully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, you can't do that. She is a German</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizen, and we are not at war with Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">many."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are," Ortega contradicted. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">President has issued the proclamation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman's passports are waiting for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have had enough of these plotting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germans. We intend to smoke out that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nest of theirs on the Negro, and send them</seg><seg type="columnLine">packing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what she has done is ante-factum,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Segovia insisted, his mind unable to enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain but the one hideous objective lliat</seg><seg type="columnLine">confronted it. "You can't-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can and will," interrupted the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">intendent. "We are not standing on points</seg><seg type="columnLine">of law these days, Enrique--not with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German empire. It knows no law." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked abruptly: "Do you wish to see her</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, this Ella Prietz?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! God, no!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Enrique recoiled from the thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What were the petty wounds to his self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esteem compared with the fate that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalking to meet this woman? He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">visualize it in every dreadful detail--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold gray of the breaking day; the blank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet-pitted wall; the fine, supple figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed before it; the leveled guns; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of command. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no!" he cried again. "I have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">account against her. It is wiped away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took a few perturbed steps about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is well," said Don Emilio soberly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now we will proceed to other matters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herr Kaufman's detention is no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">131</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary. If we had delayed a little--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but on the whole the step is not to be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gretted. We were rid of the man at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crucial moment today. Will you go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there at dark, Enrique, and let Jimmy know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what has occurred? I will put a closed car</seg><seg type="columnLine">at your disposal to bring them back--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman, and those two fine boys. It will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be best to return them under cover of</seg><seg type="columnLine">night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will go," assented Segovia indiffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently. He did not care now what Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">might think, for he was lost to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideration of his own poor vanity. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">little dreamed that at this same hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy also was in peril of his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOME one rapped for admittance</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the door. At the superintend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent's bidding a prison guard entered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He crossed to the desk and spoke in a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone. Ortega gave him a brief word in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply. He viewed Segovia thoughtfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the guard was gone, and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The first of our expected guests this</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening has arrived, the Senor Don Manuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morales. Sit down, Enrique. I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would like to have you stay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A gleam of interest lighted the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's somber eyes. It was not for Morales</seg><seg type="columnLine">--he was a black traitor, and deserved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate reserved for him. But he would speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mary Taylor--it was inevitable that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should--and it was this that invested him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with transitory interest for Enrique. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the seat Ortega indicated. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to one side, and back of the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">intendent's chair. The man with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">notebook entered in response to a button</seg><seg type="columnLine">call, and disappeared behind the screen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another button call and the door fronting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desk opened. Morales was thrust in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the door closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The heat was oppressive, but it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether this that made the sweat bubble</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on the banker's pasty face, and drip</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from his hairless crown. His beady</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes quested about the room, passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Segovia over and came to a fascinated stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the quiet man leaning back with folded</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms at the desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kindly come forward, senor," requested</seg><seg type="columnLine">the superintendent blandly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The short, heavy figure moved as di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected. No sound came from him but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stertorous laboring of the lungs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are distressed, senor," went on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">superintendent. "Is there, perhaps, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that I can do to relieve you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was playing with him as a cat a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An annoying mistake has been made,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senor Superintendent," Morales forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his dry lips, though the voicing of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scarcely above a whisper. "I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know why I am brought here. -1 have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">told nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In that case I shall be glad to supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">the omission," Ortega answered suavely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We are informed that you have plotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Herr Kaufman, the German envoy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to overturn the present Government of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zanhoria and place General Peralta in</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. Does this enlighten you, senor?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The banker had, with an enormous effort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">regained a measure of control over himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was reacting to man's primal instinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight for his life. And he was misled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his inquisitor's mild manner. His voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose in strength as he replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None of this is so. It is an outrage that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a person of position should be haled before</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in this way. Disgraceful! Some ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licious scoundrel has defamed me. I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand the proof, Senor Superintendent."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ortega spread his palms apart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, now you have asked a question."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He appeared to reflect a moment. "Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not Miss Prietz acquaint you with her loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tremor ran through Morales' frame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not understand," he declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the heavy fear that sat upon him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distinct bewilderment was manifest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ortega saw that in this at least the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was honest. The woman had not told him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid, perhaps, for her life. She had fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the legation and told her story there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they--now that the fat was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire--had not cared what became of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zanhorian tools.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You do not know Miss Prietz?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired, apparently astonished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morales was dumb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, then I don't wonder that you fail</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand," continued Don Emilio</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. "Miss Prietz was dispossessed last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night of certain papers she was charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">by General Peralta to deliver into Herr</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman's hand. Among these papers was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a list of the general's supporters in Cortina,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the preferments promised them if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolution succeeded. Do you comprehend</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, senor?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">132</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morales' assumed bravado had dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him as the last leaf from the naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree. His face was a shocking picture--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the color of rancid tallow, and with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles of it working as though there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">living worms writhing under the skin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enrique turned from the doomed traitor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt not pity for him; it was sickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgust. And yet it killed in him also</seg><seg type="columnLine">the final throb of compassion for Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taylor. She had used Morales, and denied</seg><seg type="columnLine">him his one opportunity of escape. Ortega</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a singular synchronism of thought was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying this very thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Prietz should have mentioned it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seiior," he purred. "It deprived you of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance--your car, the open road and away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was thoughtless of Miss Prietz. Treach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erous, one might even call it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morales raised an aspen hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enough!" he cried hoarsely. He swal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed with difficulty. "You have taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, too? She is here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ortega abandoned the r61e he had played.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sat erect at his desk. His expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stem and relentless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he replied, "she is here. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken in the attempt to leave the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She will be tried and shot with the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morales nodded, impatiently one would</seg><seg type="columnLine">say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes! I know. I know what to</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came a step nearer the desk. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">little eyes were glittering. He steadied</seg><seg type="columnLine">his twitching nerves as best he could, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Senor Ortega, there is a thing she can</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell that is of much importance to the State.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can make her tell it, and in reparation</seg><seg type="columnLine">for--for-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand," cut in the superintend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent. "Why not tell it yourself, Morales?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because I know only part. But with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I can force her to speak. You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a witness--the Senor Lieutenant here--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if you will have her brought in-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ortega considered him keenly. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger pressed a button. To the guard who</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bring to me Ella Prietz," he directed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked at Enrique. "There is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen if you wish, Seiior Segovia. You can</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear distinctly what passes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Enrique made a half-movement to rise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He caught Morales' gaze fixed on him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed. Why should he let the man think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he cared?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a stir at the door, and Mary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taylor was led in. At Ortega's signal the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard withdrew. The young woman's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">went first to Segovia, then to the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. She was pale, and calm, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">collected. And she was silent. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been questioned by this police official</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. She had nothing to say then;</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had nothing to say now. Ortega spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the banker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, senor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morales responded with a short gesture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He walked slowly over to where the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood by the door. He stopped a few feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are fortunately met, Miss Prietz,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said in wheedling tones. "I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">told that we are going on a journey, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of us, all friends. In view of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted consideration for me in particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought that if we went together first--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and I--in fond companionship-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God in heaven!" screamed Segovia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ortega was on his feet, leaping toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crazed man. The stenographer ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">from behind the screen. But all too late.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A shot split the air, and another. Morales</seg><seg type="columnLine">toppled over with a choking grunt, a bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his temple. Mary Taylor sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly down. Her hands were to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast. Her head drooped lower and lower,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as Enrique reached her it fell upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstretched arm, saving it from the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her clouding eyes dwelt 011 him for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat of a clock to and fro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forgive," she breathed, and was gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door was crowded with faces peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. Ortega swept them with a withering</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance. His mood was harsh, for his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment had betrayed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fools!" he lashed out. "Because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a common cutthroat you did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">think to search him for a weapon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Lincoln lay well under a mile</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■	1 nu 11 .j off the mouth of the Rio Negro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She had been towed to this position</seg><seg type="columnLine">by El Terror after a conference between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Norris and Admiral Terrozas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at which the admiral had imparted certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge he possessed of Colonel Ludolf's</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans to cover Peralta's landing.

Any craft from the lumber camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might attempt the open sea would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be blown out of the water. The Lincoln's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings were clipped, but not her claws.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And furthermore, in response to her calls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a swift United States destroyer was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> El Terror meanwhile was scouting along</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arc that embraced the possible landings</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Sea Bird on the coast.

She wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">a belt from which hung a pistol. Billy stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside her at the companion por;t. A rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in his hand. Brewer was at the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer the hall. He, too, held a rifle. Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tia Matilde sat crumpled up in a chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall by the pantry door. Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not present. He was on guard in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front rooms lest a surprise attack come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The heat was sweltering in the closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, but the three at the windows were</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblivious of it for the time. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the words Jimmy shouted to Diego,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they saw the blow on the mouth Hecht</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave his defenseless prisoner. Until then--</seg><seg type="columnLine">all their talk and preparation to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trary--the actual spilling of blood in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">emprise had to Winifred seemed somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing remote and without true imminence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, in one breath, it took on the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of reality. She could kill that man</seg><seg type="columnLine">out there!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, the coward beast, the coward</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast!" she cried. "A--ah!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy, bound though he was, had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rush at Hecht. It was, of course, a vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort. The German stepped aside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">launched a fist into the broad of Jimmy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">back as he hurtled by. It sent him pitching</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlong in through the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mauser in Billy's hand was up in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash. There was a snarling, unhuman</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound in his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'll pay for that, - him!" he said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was thrusting the rifle through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">port when Brewer called to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't!

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom of Brewer's position was apparent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To think of Jimmy--Jimmy Perry--</seg><seg type="columnLine">being knocked about in that way," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Winifred was silent. But her eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames. Brewer had gone to the outer door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was opening it to Diego. He closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and locked it after the peasant, and signed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him to enter the dining-room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed him in and held out his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give it to me," he ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Diego delivered to him the envelop on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Hecht had indited his ultimatum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old man was shaking with fear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement. He went and stood dumbly</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Tia Matilde. Brewer read out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">note to the others. They were all very</seg><seg type="columnLine">still when he finished, and very white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winifred was the first to speak. Her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was file-hard, rasping, out of key.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know what Jimmy meant.

We are not to surrender that man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her finger pointed to Kaufman's door</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the hall. Had it been the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the den of a deadly reptile there could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have been more of abhorrence in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One hour!" faltered Billy. "One hour!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is five o'clock. At six--Mr. Brewer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've got to give him up! They will shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy before our eyes. It would be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same as if we--ourselves--murdered him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brewer did not answer. He was sunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If they would do it," he murmured.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If there was a way to get them to do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Winifred was studying him intently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me, father. What are you think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing?" she demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at her vaguely, obsessed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea he had evolved. He spoke as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she had disputed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The trouble is, Winny, it lacks a motive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't you see? There is no inducement</seg><seg type="columnLine">for making the exchange. An old man for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a young man--they wouldn't do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Winifred drew in a long breath. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would save Jimmy, and he would die</seg><seg type="columnLine">134</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than surrender Kaufman. Even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this moment of extremity a fierce gladness</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled her. She ran to him and caught his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. She bowed her head to it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kissed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My father! Oh, my dear father!" The</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelling note of a great tenderness and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great pride was in her voice. "I would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">let you do it. Ah, no, no!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw off partially his abstraction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His arm went about her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it only could be done, Winny, if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">only could! You could hold out, the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you, and I--I would be to some extent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">canceling-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She hushed him with her finger to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. Her thought was of Billy, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy's thought was on neither of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was with Jimmy--out there, bound and</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless, kicked about brutally, his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging on the decision they should make</seg><seg type="columnLine">in here. He was at the window again</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the hut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They would not do it, father," Winifred</seg><seg type="columnLine">contended. "And Jimmy, he would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">consent. Don't you know that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not? We must think up another way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save him. And we must not delay, father.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The minutes are flying."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy swung around to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tell you we must let Kaufman go,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cried stubbornly. "There is no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. They may not wait.

The minister had succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in clawing back the slide, and was peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them. He had overheard Billy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Swine!" he shouted. "You would let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me smother in this accursed hole. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have heard. Ja! And I have seen. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know my men. I know what they will do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Release me, and the scoundrel shall five.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Release me-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kaufman dropped away from the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a squeal of fright. Winifred had</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched the pistol from her belt and fired--</seg><seg type="columnLine">point-blank at him, he believed. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet-hole, high above where his head had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, indicated her intent. It was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce exactly the effect that followed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would keep away from the door after this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy gritted out--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish you had killed him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tiger is in every woman, and it leaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth when she is aroused. Winifred's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was flushed with the surge of suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">unleashed passions. If Jimmy was to die</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he should be avenged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The next time-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did not finish, but moved to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest window, and gaze'd darkly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut. It was too far away for Hecht and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crew to have heard the shot distinctly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thick walls of the house would muffle</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. They were standing around discussing</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in their ponderous German</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion. Jimmy was nowhere to be seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was he lying inside there, felled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground by Hecht's barbarous blow? Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart grew hot within her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam had come running up to see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble was. Brewer sent him back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his post, and crossed over to Kaufman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. He drew the bolt and opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, and he surveyed the minister with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an oddly meditative air, as one might</seg><seg type="columnLine">consider to what use he could put an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar implement offered to his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman did not speak. He had retired</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other end of the room completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnerved for the moment. His fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched at his thick neck as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stifling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BREWER'S expression changed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It became alert, elated almost. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the door, pushed the panel to,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and returned with a lively step to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got it!" he announced. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't dare to carry out their threat."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winifred turned to him wonderingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid to believe. Billy clamored for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to proceed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, sir? For God's sake be</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall answer their note. I shall say</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them that if they do not return Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us unharmed we shall hang Kaufman</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the neck from the ridge-piece of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch. We need but the rope, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in the yard--this old woman's clothes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. I will go and get it, for they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have visible evidence that we are prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to act on our word."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And by Heaven we will!" shrilled Billy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Only I will go, not you, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was alive with hope again. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">running to the door when Winifred stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Flag	135</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neither of you shall go," she declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"To see a man gathering in the rope would</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise suspicion in them. But to see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman do it will only puzzle them. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They protested vehemently. These men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were Germans. They would as lief shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a woman as a man. She should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Winifred made an end to argument with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an imperious hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will do it! Can you not shoot if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a move? Let me pass."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her look compelled hem. Her step</seg><seg type="columnLine">was even and deliberate. Inside at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows two Mausers covered the hut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There would be a deadly reckoning for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hun who raised a hand against that small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slim form.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl detached the line from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supports, going from post to post in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">business-like manner. She coiled the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">methodically as she went along. She felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">singularly devoid of fear, singularly intent</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this one thing she was doing. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts did not go beyond it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Germans were standing perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, watching her. They had ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking. She was a dozen yards nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">them when her task, so far, was ended.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She did not cast a glance in their direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently they did not exist for her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked back to the house with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberate step, and they watched her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same bewildered silence. The extraor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary procedure held them as in a spell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were unable to fathom what it fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">told; and it was this that Winifred had</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now that they could not see her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands she was busy with the line, working</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, surely. She came to the porch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused. Brewer called to her urgently</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his port in the shutter. He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know what she intended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Child! Comein. I am in agony for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did not heed him. The ridge-piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">projected several inches from the porch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the end it was hewn into a knob in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough attempt at an ornamental finish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winifred gaged it with her eye. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight feet above her from the topmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">step. She hesitated, then with her whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">will to succeed she cast the coiled line up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the beam. It was a ten-strike! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">line fell across the beam and down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She pulled at the end she had retained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her hand, and a slip-noose dangled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. She looked, then, at the Germans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head scornfully high, and went into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. Even then the men made not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sound. They did not understand, for to</seg><seg type="columnLine">associate the imperial envoy's neck with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that pendent cord was a thing so incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceivable that it could not find lodgment in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their skulls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, girl, girl! I could kiss your shoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that!" cried out Billy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She answered with a strained smile, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank weakly into a chair. Her knees all</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once had given way. Brewer was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table writing. He had slit open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelop on which Hecht's message was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed, and was penciling on the inner side</seg><seg type="columnLine">his counter-ultimatum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy in the interim was talking rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Diego, though he still held his place</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the window to keep the Germans in view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A project that had been forming in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind had taken definite shape. At a stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their talk the old peasant drew from</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his dingy shirt a long, keen sheath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife. He felt the edge, wagging his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowingly, and replaced it with care. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lack-luster eyes was a gleam of cupidity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a passion that masters fear. If all went well</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was a made man. He would have a farm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own. Billy had pledged it to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Jimmy's name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brewer stood up. He beckoned to Di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ego.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet," interjected Billy. "I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten minutes the start of him. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">half an hour left, and I've got a plan. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">may pan out. Anyway I'm going to try it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neiderlein isn't with that bunch over there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Landeker.

Well, my scheme is to join them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turn Jimmy loose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Winifred caught at her breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Billy! They will find you out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't interrupt," he barked at her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on in sharp, short sentences. "I'm a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cortina German, and in the know. Neider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lein has sent me. News! Peralta has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken. An American war-ship got him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The city is in arms against the Germans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hecht is not to bring'Kaufman back there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something like that--I'll fix it up right."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But Kaufman will see you with them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He will call out and warn them, if he can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make them understand at this distance,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">objected Winifred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">136</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He won't have time.

He'll answer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'll have to. And then is the time to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diego with the note. A little after won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt.

A rough, straddle-legged table</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted firmly in the dirt floor of the hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved him. He sprawled across it, groveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it, and regained his footing. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grievous heat the water rained unhindered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his face on to his fettered hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were swollen and numb. The stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his back bit into him until his spine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was near to cracking with it. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded it not. A murderous wrath con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed him. He wanted, more than life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get at Hecht; not with any weapon of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's make, but with those nature had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given him--his naked fists. He wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel the impact of them on Hecht's flesh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">battering it to a pulp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fit passed. Blind passion would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">get him anywhere, and he had need of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wits. He looked about him. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an opening in the wall on each side that</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered for a window. At the rear a door</seg><seg type="columnLine">led out directly into the forest. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no escape for him in that direction. Bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he was it would be useless to attempt it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would take him before he had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">two rods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stool was on the other side of the table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all that Jimmy noted of the squalid</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnishings. He went around to it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down. It was a change of position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more. It brought him little ease</seg><seg type="columnLine">of body; the table was high and he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not rest even a rigid elbow on it. But from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this point he could view what went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the door and, beyond, he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He wondered what answer they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make to Hecht's message, and if Diego had</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated to them the charge he had called</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him. The man was frightened out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his skin; he might not have heard, or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing, might have let the words go in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one ear and out the other. Would Brewer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this event, surrender Kaufman? Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayed that he would not. It would mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the flag must come down, and solely</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of his own pig-headed folly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed himself as he thought of it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rather die, far rather, than to live</seg><seg type="columnLine">on in the knowledge that it was for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">those starry folds were lowered. And yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die trussed up like a barnyard fowl ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the oven. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were talking in low tones out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the hut, possibly for the reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they fancied he was conversant with</seg><seg type="columnLine">German. Aside from this a wide stillness</seg><seg type="columnLine">reigned. Not a sound of bird or beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke upon it, not a whispering murmur</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tall tree-tops all about. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the quiet of a world hushed in a dread,</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectant pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy saw the door of the house open</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Winifred come forth. He rose, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart in his mouth. He lost sight of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">137</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as she moved toward the kitchen, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped quietly over to the window on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left that he might keep her in view. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those others in front he was mystified by</seg><seg type="columnLine">her actions. Yet he knew that some vital</seg><seg type="columnLine">urge impelled her. His breath came short</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hard as he watched, and it went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a long sigh of immeasurable relief when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was once again at the door. He watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, as did the others, cast the rope over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ridge-piece, and dimly he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand. Then, as she turned and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time cast a glance at the Germans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole truth burst in on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is their answer," he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And oh, isn't she plucky!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned to the stool to think on what</seg><seg type="columnLine">would follow. Brewer would send his</seg><seg type="columnLine">defiance to Hecht, and then what? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be the next move? Hecht would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare to shoot him now, but he would keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a prisoner just the same. Where was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way out for either side from the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passe?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hecht came to the door while he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">studying the problem and flung a question</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you moved his excellency to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another room?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you speaking of the man Kaufman?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter-questioned Jimmy coolly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hecht gave him a poisonous look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am speaking of Herr Adolph Kaufman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Imperial-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never the mind the rattle to his tail,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut in Jimmy.

Another blow, and I won't stop at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you get at me!" Hecht laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his contempt. "If in half an hour Herr</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman is not released you will be lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">out there with a hole in your head, Perry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is as near as you will come to getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me. I can promise you that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy looked him over coldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a waste of breath, I suppose, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will make you a proposition, Hecht--it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">your only chance to deliver Kaufman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cut this cord and stand up before me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your fists. Do me in, and you shall have</seg><seg type="columnLine">your man; I pledge my word to it. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do you in I'm to go free. Now, if you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not entirely the dirty coward you've shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself to be you will take me up. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you don't, and you shoot me, you will see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman swinging at the end of that rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">over there the minute afterward. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it's for, Hecht. I can promise you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This monstrous statement swept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teuton's mind of the personal implication</seg><seg type="columnLine">the challenge carried. The Kaiser's envoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be hanged by the neck like a common</seg><seg type="columnLine">malefactor! It was beyond the pale of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason; it was an impossibility! He stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Jimmy, seeking in him some evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of impaired sanity. Jimmy guessed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you don't believe it, Hecht, take me</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and shoot me," he taunted. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain that you are not man enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle this thing as I've proposed. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the kind we read about--baby-killers!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one instant Jimmy's life hung by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread. The German's hand went to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol. He drew it ha!f-forth from his belt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated, and with an oath thrust it back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dangling rope over there beyond had</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed on his mental vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From a distance in the coffee-field came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a call:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leutnant Herr Hecht! Leutnant Ilerr</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hecht!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man looked in at the door, and spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lieutenant. He went out in haste.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy heard the call again, nearer by, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Hecht answer--a harsh command,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed to him. Silence ensued; a wait,</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably, for whoever it was to come up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, issuing from the house, Jim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">my saw Tio Diego. He moved sluggishly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the hut, as though loath to arrive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something white in his hand--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slip of paper. All at once his step livened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Jimmy forgot him in the amazing scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">that claimed his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy passed before the door with Hecht.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were talking in German, Hecht</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruffly questioning, Billy replying with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dramatic vigor. Not for the wink of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyelash did his glance stray the prisoner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">133</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">way. They paused a little to the left of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance. Jimmy could catch a glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Hecht gesticulating violently. The re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining Germans gradually approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot, curiosity drawing them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now Diego arrived, cringing servilely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He extended the note to Hecht, and cowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, but not toward the house. Inch by</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch, as the Germans crowded up to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader to hear the message read, Diego</seg><seg type="columnLine">neared the door of the hut. Jimmy might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been of stone for any movement that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he made. A drama was being played in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which there was a part reserved for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This he understood, and he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently it would be revealed to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Diego's back showed at the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. If a chance eye had been directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him he was merely leaning against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall humbly waiting for their excellencies</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have their will of him. But of a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back straightened. An outcry had</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded from the house. A great voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent the air, and pistol-shots followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a catlike bound Diego was inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut. The slash of a knife, and Jimmy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">free and Diego at the door again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JIMMY thrashed his numbed arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his sides. He toiled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands, one with the other, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit into them with his teeth until the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed. Life came surging back into them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was at last able to grasp the revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diego had left for him on the table. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped over to the window. Sam was</seg><seg type="columnLine">running toward the hut. He came on</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellowing like a stampeded steer. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Billy's voice raised excitedly to Hecht,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and conjectured that he was trying to allay</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other's distrust of the remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Billy will give me a signal--surely--</seg><seg type="columnLine">surelyt" Jimmy breathed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam had stopped running. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a few feet of the watching group.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy slipped around to the door, keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the wall. Diego had moved away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was standing behind a big German</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose hand was on his gun. Diego's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in his shirt bosom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam was up to them now--in the midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. He was laboring, it seemed, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech. But his was not a speaking part;</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had been told what to say he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have remembered it in this hasty role</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had assumed. He raised his hand in an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">uncouth attempt at a military salute--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and the other hand, doubled into huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">granite fists, crashed full into the faces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two nearest Germans. They went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down like slaughtered beeves. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">action Billy's automatic was jabbed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hecht's stomach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Jimmy!" he shouted. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hands up!" to Hecht.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy was already out and at work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam's attack had been a sufficient signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him. Diego's man was reeling with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gushing knife-wound deep in his neck--</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying on his feet. The peasant, his courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly gone, was in full flight for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter of the woods. The fifth man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired at him, and missed. He wheeled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy's appearance, and they both let go</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same instant. Jimmy felt a searing</seg><seg type="columnLine">streak on his temple. The German's pistol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm dropped. A strangling cough distorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his features. He doubled up and came in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lump to the ground. The other German</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell over, kicked convulsively, and lay quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy put his hand to his head. Blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on it when he took it away. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a narrow squeak for him. He started</seg><seg type="columnLine">over where Billy held Hecht at pistol-point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam was rising up from the two Huns he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had felled. They had come to, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro had their weapons corraled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jes' drawin' deir teeth, boss," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned as Jimmy passed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are a prince, Sam," commended</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy. "Gather up those other tools</seg><seg type="columnLine">back there. As for these chaps kick them</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the lot. We don't want any prisoners."</seg><seg type="columnLine">To Billy he said simply--"I owe you one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not till you have frisked this skunk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun," the boy replied. "For two cents</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd save you the trouble," he growled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hecht. "Keep those hands up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thirty seconds would have covered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drama's action from the time of Billy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning shout. But there was an epilogue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come. Jimmy devised it, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat of his desire all else was forgotten--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men lying dead by the door of the hut--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman--Winifred--Brewer--all things in</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaven and earth but this man Hecht.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wouldn't have you harm him, Billy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all the money in the mint," he said in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">silky voice. "I promised him something</seg><seg type="columnLine">in there, and I'm going to give it to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now. I can't wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took Hecht's pistol from him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">139</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his own, the one he had been relieved of</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the riverside. He passed them over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy together with the revolver Diego had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him. Hecht did not speak, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, flashing from one to the other, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hells of hate. Kaufman was bawling ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jurgations at him from his vent in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutters. He had seen everything, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hecht knew that his career was closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, you baby-killer, put up your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands," Jimmy ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He squared away for the German's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack. So intent was he on the business</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him that he did not notice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer and Winifred had come out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, and were in the yard watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding affair. They had brought their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifles with them. Old Tia Matilde cowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind on the steps. Nor did Billy remark</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He stood by with shining eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was as it should be. Jimmy was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wipe out in the only way possible the</seg><seg type="columnLine">indignities to which he had been subjected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Hecht did not put up his fists. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">decent art of self-defense was not his. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered his head, and rushed in with</seg><seg type="columnLine">taloned fingers clutching for his opponent's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. It was child's play for Jimmy, this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He leaped aside and planted a blow behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hecht's ear that sent him plowing into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One!" cried Billy. "Oh, boy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "De Lawd bless me," chuckled Sam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had obeyed Jimmy literally, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked his two Germans into the coffee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field; and he had turned in time to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hecht go down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man climbed heavily to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dashed the sweat from his eyes and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lesson learned, he crouched and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">warily circling around his foe. If he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">close with him, get a wrestling hold! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would know his way then. Jimmy saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Hecht was up to. He did not intend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let the fellow come to a clinch with him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not too sure of that freshly healed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lung of his, and, besides, the thought of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining embrace with the brute nauseated</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, you Boche," he invited softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I knew there was no such thing as a stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up fight in you. Come on and strike me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mouth. You did it once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hecht believed he saw an opening, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed in. His rage carried him smashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Jimmy's guard. But before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make his grip fast Jimmy shot in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">short-arm jab to his jaw that staggered him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It gave Jimmy the chance to throw him off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the same motion he got in a vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">uppercut to his chin. Hecht tottered back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun around dizzily and dropped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two!" counted Billy rapturously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A shrill, flesh-creeping cry pierced the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy swung around from the supine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teuton. Tia Matilde was fleeing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the porch to Winifred, her hands raised in</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror above her head. Behind her, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, Kaufman's bearded face showed for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. A raucous laugh rolled from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, and the door was banged to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On his last visit to the man Brewer had</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected to shoot the bolt that held him</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner, and he had found it out. And in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the living-room were loaded guns--two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mausers, a Colt, and Kaufman's own</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammerless S. &amp; W.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXXI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BREWER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TT WAS a meteoric moment. Winifred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Brewer stood looking uncertainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the closed door. The baleful occurrence</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have dazed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the kitchen, Winifred! Quick!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quick!" Jimmy shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grabbed a pistol from Billy and set</seg><seg type="columnLine">out full tilt for the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hecht had got to his feet, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unarmed, and they paid him no attention.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy started to follow Jimmy. Sam, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the background where he had been collect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the weapons of the dead Germans, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. And then came what was near to</seg><seg type="columnLine">proving Billy's end. With his second step</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tripped and fell. The pistols piled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands scattered right and left. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twinkling Hecht had pounced on one, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring his triumph, drew it down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prostrate boy. But the bullet plowed harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly into the ground. Hccht had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second too late. Sam fired first, not ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet from him, and the .45 bored his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">through from side to side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good boy, Sam!" yapped Billy as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled up and retrieved the guns he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spilled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam scooped up the one Hecht had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped, and they raced on, leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hun gurgling out his life in the trodden</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt. Both Jimmy and Brewer had stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the man's savage cry, but before either</seg><seg type="columnLine">140</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could shoot, the negro had dispatched him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They all crowded into the kitchen-house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was under twenty yards from the dining-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, but the solid stone walls defied any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing short of a field-piece. They had but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep away from the window, and Kauf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man would not have a chance at them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the southeast window of his prison</seg><seg type="columnLine">room he could have commanded the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not the shutters been nailed fast; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the angle was too sharp for accurate aim</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the peepholes. The situation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, was not without its danger, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moreover, it was humiliating. The trap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers were trapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was my criminal carelessness," Brewer</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy did not understand, but it was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for futile questions. Billy and Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">were depositing their superfluous pistols on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chair. Billy turned abruptly and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say! What's to prevent Kaufman</seg><seg type="columnLine">from going quietly out at the front and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scooting off. He may have done it already."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was a new thought to them, for until</seg><seg type="columnLine">then it had been fixed in their minds that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minister would hold the house till an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other rescuing party should arrive. Nei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derlein would certainly send more men, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably head them himself, to learn why</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hecht did not return to the legation. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not know of the cloudburst, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay consequent upon it. Even now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be on his way to the farm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kaufman was brought here in the night,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Winifred reflectively. "He doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the country it is likely. I don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would venture out alone; and he doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how many of us he has to deal with.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He may think we have some one stationed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the trees at the front to watch the door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The answer to their problem was start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingly unexpected. Brewer had put his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle aside, and immersed in thought was</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving toward the back of the kitchen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where was another door giving into a smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, which, in turn, opened on a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">strip between the kitchen-house and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipitous hillside on the west. He passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the window. Instantly a gun spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a bullet whistled through the window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It missed Brewer only by an inch or so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Father!" gasped Winifred, white with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's found the guns!" cried Billy. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">is going to keep us here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In two hours it will be dark. Then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can do something," said Jimmy. "He can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard all the windows at one and the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But if he gets reinforcements! Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaps we let go will tear back to the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their car. Neiderlein will come out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bigger bunch." Billy wrinkled his nose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not in comedy now. "Gee, Jimmy, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't look any too good to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy glanced over at Brewer. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seem to be upset by his narrow call.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wore, rather, an abstracted air that took</seg><seg type="columnLine">no account of his surroundings. He beck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oned to Jimmy with a slight gesture, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy, ducking below the window-sill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to him. Winifred, still in the clutch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her fright, leaned limply against the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watched them. But for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">only. Brewer led the way into the adjoin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing room and closed the intervening door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He spoke rapidly and quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is an enormity--Kaufman holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house with the flag flying over him. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is my fault, and it is my business to find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remedy. There is a way, and I will attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What way?" broke in Jimmy, puzzled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The doors are fast, and the shutters are</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolted on the inside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have forgotten the skylight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The skylight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It shot through Jimmy's mind that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">these events had affected the man's reason.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer answered calmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly that. It is open and the lad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der in the hall is up. It is not probable that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaufman has removed it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh," interrupted Jimmy again, "but the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing is impossible, -sir. How-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait!" enjoined Brewer curtly. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is another ladder. It lies along the east</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the house. It was used, I imagine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for repairing the roof. At any rate it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. I shall raise it, and go up in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocking feet for a better foothold on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiles. I will go down through the skylight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and surprise Kaufman in the dining-room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your part is to keep him busy until I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy gazed at him in silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Jove!" he breathed at last. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then: "I believe it could be done, only how</seg><seg type="columnLine">will you get from here to the east side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house? Kaufman will shoot you</seg><seg type="columnLine">down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brewer led him to the outer door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">141</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CTI "THERE!" he said. "If I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the edge I can claw my way</seg><seg type="columnLine">along below eye-range and come up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the farther end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And a slip would send you to the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom. Mr. Brewer, this is work for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">younger man. I want you to let me-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brewer stopped him with a remonstrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. A flickering, inscrutable smile played</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his mouth and vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have, I think, a special strength for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this," he said. "When you came to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other day and told what was required</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me it--well, it meant new life to me. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant what a shipwrecked man must feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">who sees a sail come up over the horizon</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he has lost all hope--a ship flying his</seg><seg type="columnLine">country's flag. I can't very well make you</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand, Mr. Perry, but this work is for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me alone. It is for no other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hesitated, and brought out a key from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If anything happens to me this will open</seg><seg type="columnLine">my box at the Credito Mercantil in Cortina.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is money in it, a great deal of money.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there are papers. You will understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you read them. Winifred will know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to do; it is what I shall do if I live to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see this thing finished. She--Winifred--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">faithful through all-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice broke and he did not go on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy reached out and took his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked steadily into Brewer's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not have to read the papers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand," he said with feeling. "Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween you and me and Winifred all is well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir. You are going to succeed--Mr. Bow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--and you are going home with us, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this is over, in honor and high regard."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer shivered as with cold. His head</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank upon his breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know!" he choked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From the first I have known; but w'hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not know was that I should come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this downright liking for you. You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">won it, sir, and how, it shall be my privilege</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brewer's head came up gradually. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">his look was indeed the hope of the rescued</seg><seg type="columnLine">castaway. He gripped Jimmy's hand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">both his own, but he said only--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait one minute, until you hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing," Jimmy cautioned him. "You can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make your break under cover of it. Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck, sir. And remember, we are all pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned to the others. Winifred</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutely questioned him with her eyes. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her in a dozen words what her father</seg><seg type="columnLine">had undertaken to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now Billy--Sam--stand back from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, and start shooting out of it when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">call. Not too fast, and not together. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots each."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For himself, he caught up Brewer's rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and warily poked the muzzle out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window corner so that it very nearly shel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered him from view. Only a minute por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of his arm and shoulder showed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now!" he called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With each shot from the door Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumped one at the dining-room, praying it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find Kaufman at the port he selected</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his doubtful aim. The combined effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as if all six shots were delivered at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. Kaufman returned hesitantly what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he possibly took for a fusilade, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not see where it came from. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired once or twice at the kitchen window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then was silent. Jimmy ran into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back room, and looked out. Brewer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. The ruse had diverted attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his movements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I could watch how he gets along!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dining-room commanded both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front and rear doors of the kitchen, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy calculated that with a cautious step</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the rear door, and flattening himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the wall, he could gain the shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the south side, and from that point, mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back a little, he could see the roof of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big house. Ten seconds would do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried it, and succeeded without draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Kaufman's fire. He was protected from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dining-room, but he perceived that</seg><seg type="columnLine">should Kaufman take a notion to go to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own room to reconnoiter the kitchen terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory he could with a slant shot pot any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who moved outside a limited area in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flank of the building. But from within</seg><seg type="columnLine">this area Jimmy found that the skylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in plain sight. And it was a degree</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooler here than in the low-ceiled kitchen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned in the same guarded man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, and reported his discovery. Tia Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilde would not budge. She sat crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall with the determination to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain there until all danger had passed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the others ducked under the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Jimmy. He took charge of Winifred's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle and instructed her how to proceed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">m</seg><seg type="columnLine">142</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go first," lie directed. "I will be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">close touch of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His idea was to shield her should Kauf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man glimpse them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His purpose was clear to the girl. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a moment her eyes rested on him--on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his blood-stained cheek--with soft intensity;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then in quiet obedience she stepped out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. He was instantly at her side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy followed with Brewer's rifle, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam. The great bulk of the negro was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">so easily flattened against the wall. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack of a Mauser came from the dining-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and Sam sputtered an exclamation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O-o-o! I cudn't 'a' slipped er sheet o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">writin' paper 'tween dat an' me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      THEY reached the safety zone with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out further incident, and they stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">"* with their eyes on the flag hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">slack on its pole over the skylight. Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">took advantage of the respite to reload the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine of Brewer's gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope Kaufman doesn't start to ram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling about the house," he said nervously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It would be easy to see Mr. Brewer, or hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at the living-room windows."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Or he might go up to the roof. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then--if he should see father coming! Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think he might do that, Jimmy?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winifred laid a trembling hand on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. He laid his own over it reassuringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't think he'd attempt it," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. "That ladder is mighty shaky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this move of ours will set him to guess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He will try to figure out what we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to, and he won't venture away from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the house. He will want to keep a</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch on us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll tell you something you don't know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy," said Billy earnestly. "Mr. Brewer</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to make a deal with Hecht to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">change places with you--to be shot in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, if it came to that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He did?" said Jimmy very quietly. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish I had known it before, Billy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He met Winifred's eyes. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">humid. He pressed her hand, and it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponded. They fell quiet after this, all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, waiting tensely for Brewer's appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance on the tiles. A tremendous stillness</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped the earth. So still was it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they heard, or fancied they did, the scrap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the ladder Brewer was erecting against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My Lawd, w'at's dat!" ejaculated Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a scared voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They looked in the direction in which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pointing. Bounding out from the woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the hut was a great, tan-colored beast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spotted black with a white breast and belly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It stopped in the open. Its long, sinewy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail switched from side to side, and its furry</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears were flattened to its head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A jaguar!" whispered Billy. "Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing is wrong or it would never come this</seg><seg type="columnLine">near a house."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They gazed fascinated at the giant cat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It saw them, but it took no note of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It held a curious listening poise. And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">its head went up, and a deep, hoarse cry--</seg><seg type="columnLine">pu, pu--issued from its throat. It bounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">off into the coffee-field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Billy swore under his breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then lifted his voice in a warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Regrese, Diego, regresel"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From around the back of the stables to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right, trotting toward them, came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old peasant from his skulking-place in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods. He had seen them gathered out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there by the kitchen wall and imagined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably, that no danger threatened; for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know the true state of affairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused at Billy's call, a fatal moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A spurt of flame burst from the southeast</seg><seg type="columnLine">window of the house. Diego turned to run.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another shot, and Diego rolled over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and lay in a huddled heap. And still</seg><seg type="columnLine">another shot followed. A scream echoed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. Old Tia Matilde staggered into</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. She whirled about, rocked to and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fro--and there was a second motionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddle on the ground. Matilde had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth at the sound of her husband's name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgetful of the hazard, and Kaufman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot her down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God, the butchering brute!" thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered Jimmy. He sprang out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheltering wall, and poured the five shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his Mauser into one vent and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other of Kaufman's windows. Billy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, firing in the same furious rage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no reply. Kaufman had emp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied the magazines of his guns, or a bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But another sight claimed them. Brewer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the roof. He was at the skylight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, what they had not noticed in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">last fierce minutes, a torrid air had sprung up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It rippled out the folds of the flag above</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer. He looked down at\them, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at the flag. For a moment they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him thus--and were hurled flat on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">143</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">faces in the roar and crash of a world-shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing convulsion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came again and again. They lay where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been dashed down, bruised and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned. They had no voice with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shriek their fears. Each recurrent shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to lift and crush them down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horrible beast-cries came from the for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est. All about were sounds of grinding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping earth, of great boulders hurtling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hill. And now descended on them</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rain that held no moisture--a soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealthy rain of ashes borne on the increas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing breeze from old Borazo, awakened fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">after these many years to a devouring activ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. It was an hour from sunset, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom of a dying twilight was on the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A pause came in the shocks. It grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer, lengthened into minutes. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">filthy rain still fell, and over in the south</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a pale, ghastly glow reflected from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">molten lava the volcano was spewing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its bowels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy put out a groping hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Winifred!" he called in a labored whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per. "Winifred--Winifred!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her hand touched his. She had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jimmy!" she whispered back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Billy--Sam!" he called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They answered, and presently one by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one they ventured to their knees, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally, with a painful effort, to their feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They stared about them in the gloom, hot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed and horror-bound. Only a mound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stone where the kitchen had been lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them and the house. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house--it was but a greater mound! Part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it had tumbled down the cliff, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been shorn away to the very foundation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stables were gone. Brewer's car lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried deep under the wreckage. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not an upstanding stick or stone within</seg><seg type="columnLine">their view. They were alone, these four,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a broken, barren hill-crest, the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing human creatures of all those that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had peopled it an hour before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Father! Father!" It scarcely stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">the awful stillness, so low and tremulous a</seg><seg type="columnLine">note it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy's arm went around the desolate</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's bowed form. He drew her gently to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and her head rested on his breast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And they stood thus for many minutes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft, smothering, abhorrent rain from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mount Borazo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXXII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOMEWARD BOUND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS Saturday noon.

He had been visiting in the country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with his host was buried in the ruins</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the house. This, so it was stated, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only fact known at present. In short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Government had seen to it that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burden of explanatory details should rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the legation, if it cared to shoulder it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lane was speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is pretty bad, James. Some forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings are wrecked, and two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives lost by present reports. The list may</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow. Now tell me just what happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">out there. From the beginning, please.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've worried myself sick about you. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I see you have had a hurt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That?" Jimmy touched his temple con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptuously. "A miss is as good as a mile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As briefly as he could he narrated what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had occurred up to the moment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'quake. His face was very grave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When we were able to get our wits to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether," he went on, "we groped our way</seg><seg type="columnLine">down through the coffee-field to the Santa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marta Road, and from there to the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">and always in that hideous velvet rain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinking ashes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shuddered as he recalled it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We waited there for ages. Black night</seg><seg type="columnLine">came on. And there was another shock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but only a tremor this time. It scared us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, I can promise you. The river had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen so that if it had been day we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have crossed, but we were afraid to try it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dark. And then came the lights of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a car on the other side. We shouted and--</seg><seg type="columnLine">oh. I'll cut it short; I can't think of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. It was Enrique--good old En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rique! He hadn't forgotten us in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedies of the day. On the way in we</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed an overturned car. It had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">144</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in the 'quake. Those two Germans</seg><seg type="columnLine">were under it, and dead. The road was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty bad in spots, but Enrique made it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took us to his home, Don Luis' house."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He drew a long breath and continued.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Enrique told us about Mary Taylor--</seg><seg type="columnLine">her death -- and I knew what the telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost him. We did not press him for par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticulars. By Heaven, Mr. Lane, I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">living with men since I struck in here--</seg><seg type="columnLine">men! Enrique, Billy Smith, Black Sam--</seg><seg type="columnLine">God bless him--and Brewer. You didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know Brewer, I believe you told me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scanned Lane closely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. He never called at the legation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not know him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a short pause. Then Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">said slowly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No matter how this Kaufman business</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolves itself in retrospect, no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether it helped or did not help, Brewer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul was in it. He died for it--the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man--under his own flag."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was another pause. Lane broke it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And Mr. Brewer's daughter? You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely mentioned her, James."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy gave him a straight look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She is very lonely, and she is very deso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late, Mr. Lane. And I love her. Is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for me to say? Or--" his expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightened--"shall I tell you that &amp; I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevail on her she will be my wife before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat sails for home tomorrow. To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, if she will consent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lane started in his chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why--God bless me--my dear boy!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ah--er--humph, you have a sudden way</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you. But a thousand good wishes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">James--ten thousand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grasped Jimmy's hand and wrung</seg><seg type="columnLine">it fervently. The ghost of a grin flitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">across Jimmy's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will collect afterward," he said. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">meanwhile if you can send around to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently four hundred dollars of the nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred I left with you I'll be obliged. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be enough to buy us some presentable</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, and get us home. There will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of us in the party, for of course Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">will go along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But why not all the money, James."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The rest is for a small remembrance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy Smith--after I am gone. I will ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to attend to that for me, sir. Billy,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, is out of a job-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The devil he is!" roared the Hon. John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry. "With all the work before me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">now? As soon as we see you out of town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he will have to buckle to and help Whitta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ker. And by the way, you are lucky about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railroad. The quake did not damage</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seriously. The trains can run. Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isaacs got in last night with only a minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mrs. Isaacs!" Jimmy stared his aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishment. "Is she back again looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her uncle?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lane guffawed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, so Enrique has not told^ou?" The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hon. John Henry enjoyed his surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Even Ortega did not suspect her at first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will tell you about her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he did, chuckling greatly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">added:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have had news from Terrozas</seg><seg type="columnLine">today. He wired the full story. He inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted the Peralta expedition, bagged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole outfit, and brought them into Puerto</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mono. Our gunboat settled the Arraca</seg><seg type="columnLine">business; blocked the river mouth so they</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't send their launches out. It seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">also that there was a German U about, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terrozas settled that account. He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed into a great figure in the State.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will have particulars about the U today.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Norris is coming up to see me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He talked these matters over at greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">length for Jimmy's enlightenment. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he concluded Jimmy rose to go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he remarked with deep satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, "I've had a small hand in one little</seg><seg type="columnLine">shindy; now I'm going home home to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand in the big one. I've filed a cable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to father saying that I'm safe and sailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you mention the surprise you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">in store for him?" hinted the minister slyly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy answered with a return of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">former seriousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir. That is something I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduce to a telegraphic announcement. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to say, Mr. Lane, that when I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">home again, and have seen father and Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allan, you will get from them a personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciation of your kindness to me. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my own thanks, I won't try to put them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in words."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lane followed him to the door, radiating</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it is to be tonight, James," he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed unctuously, "I must be informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an early hour.

"I haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Miss Brewer to marry me yet. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have only hopes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "W-what!" exclaimed the astounded man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I am going to ask her, inside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">half an hour," Jimmy finished, "and I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">let you know the result."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left the Hon. John Henry with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth open in a vain attempt at speech,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went down the stairs to the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY were in the library of Senor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valera's house, and alone. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary was at his office whelmed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inordinate duties the great disaster had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaped on him. Enrique was in charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a provost-marshal's detail policing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken city. And Billy Smith, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom beyond his years, had removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to other scenes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it because it is so soon after, Wini-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fred?" Jimmy questioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her head moved in dreary negation. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was white and worn from the terrors she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed through; and yet these were as</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing now to the sweeping sense of deso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation that beset her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not that, Jimmy--what difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">could it make? He is dead, and his tomb</seg><seg type="columnLine">is reared above him; it is there I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">him lie. And for me, there are no barren</seg><seg type="columnLine">conventions to be observed. And yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy, it is because he is dead that I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">go my way apart from you. It is because</seg><seg type="columnLine">a secret is buried with him that I, his daugh-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, should be the last to tell. I can not</seg><seg type="columnLine">share it with you, Jimmy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you love me. You have said it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winifred."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ah! If love were only all of life!" She</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasped her hands with a passionate gesture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which also was the eloquence of a su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preme despair. "But it is not all. Honor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dishonor are in it, and pride and shame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We are prisoners to them for good or bad."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She moved away a few aimless steps, car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing only that she should not see his sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pliant eyes. He did not follow. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">very quietly where he was, and he said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your father, when I parted with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave into my keeping a key. I was to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in case anything happened to him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">key was to his strong-box at the Credito</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mercantil. He said there were money and</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers there, and I was to read the papers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have read them, Winifred."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had turned, and was gazing at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in incredulous surprise. It was several</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds before she spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know!" They were her father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">words--the same choked cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He answered her, as he had her father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his smile was infinitely tender and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passionate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "From the first I knew it, Winifred. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told your father that I knew, and his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in mine at that last moment before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on a brave man's mission, and met a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave man's death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You knew--all the time--and it made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no difference?"

A long moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervened.

The gaudy jade had virtue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, strangely enough, was the trouble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She wouldn't let herself go easy. She let</seg><seg type="columnLine">it be understood around camp that only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best man could get her, so there was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">question to be decided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman was that kind. She wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. Tribute of trouble was wine to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her red lips. She was the kind to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">by while men fought for her. Men did it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too; made ribbons of one another. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps you begin to see her, rich in sex, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal magnificence, in sheer splendor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flesh -- a strapping, stunning crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, slender and lithe and lazy. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth was a painted Cupid's bow; a ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">satile Cupid's bow whipped by whim, petu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lant, haughty, cruel or melting; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, smoky eyes were heavy with chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenge and slumberous mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her name was Suprema, and she fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name for all its crude genesis. In gilt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaded lettering on a patent-medicine label</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word had appealed to her mother's</seg><seg type="columnLine">naive soul. The word was part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish translation descriptive of the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled remedy. "Suprema!" It had a gor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geous sound, irresistible as carmen and gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Enough--the babe was christened Suprema;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Suprema the woman was of a glamor</seg><seg type="columnLine">to match.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suprema couldn't bother Jonathan Sam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though--not yet, not very much. Jona-</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Sam liked to be care-free and wear a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful grin under his tousled mop. Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't denying that the woman went to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head when she came around and her per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumery was in the air. Just the same, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thirty-seven shades too resplendent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way of Egyptian bliss for Jonathan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam. He'd have something more home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folksy for his, thank you. And besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was the use? "Old Jock"--that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">John, though John wasn't old, only big and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow and florid, with a bald spot--old Jock</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get her anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Jock more than shared his cousin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam's prophetic feeling that he, Jock, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the one to get Suprema. Old Jock had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten much already because he knew, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known, how to use his fists. Thus it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Jock, and not Sam nor yet Johann,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had staked off the likeliest claims in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first rush to Placer Sands. It was Jock</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had jumped other claims; who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed creek frontage right and left--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">God help the hindmost, including Johann!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naturally, therefore, concerning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp's ravishing trouble-maker, old Jock</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it for granted that when he beckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">she'd come. It never penetrated his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtable skull that she had begun to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Johann; that her looks were mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">provocative, too. And Jock neither saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor heard if she sighed forlorn and artful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Great Foolishness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">147</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> iust for Jonathan Sam to hear. But then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jock couldn't have felt any real hostility</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Sam, anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward Sam, Jock was more like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">older brother; an overbearing bull-headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother, and Jonathan Sam had riled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swatted him for it once or twice, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any permanent hard feelings either</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Those two never really took advan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tage of one another, but without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">extra friendly, either, when it comes to that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But about Johann, now--about the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousin--well, old Jock ought to have both-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, that's all. He certainly ought. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughtn't to have been bull-headed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocksure and blind as the under edge of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone wall where Johann figured into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game. For while Jock was burly and soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann was burly and hard and getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">harder. Johann panned his own gravel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rapids all day, even though he liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to smoke and be sociable of an evening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and maybe get poetic about the volcano</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust in the sunset sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johann might have seemed warmer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted and more subject to honest grief or</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirth than stiff old Jock; but that was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a part of the man that Johann was, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a craftily calculated part. Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed it--there were woman notions back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Cousin Johann's blond, brooding head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three men would scarcely have</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked the same time for one of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">periodical hikes back to cities and civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. They certainly would have picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another for companions on the peril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous trek across desert and sierra. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman was going too. Her swarthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanderer father, who dealt faro smiling a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed gleam of white teeth, had himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">cashed in, and the desolated daughter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance had smoothed smoother the tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">sash over her hips and expressed little won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der but what she'd be moving on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lone temptresses, of course, did not move</seg><seg type="columnLine">on over a bone-dry wilderness so casual as</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that, but it appeared directly that John</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going back to bank his gold-dust and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam largely to blow his, and she mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Johann, laughing low, that she was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them. So Johann went also. Su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prema knew then that the journey would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be monotonous; she had so provided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were the four of them who went</seg><seg type="columnLine">and also a boy, besides pack-animals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounts. The boy was a sturdy, sober-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded, industrious waif belonging to no-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">body. He had a portable forge and he used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sharpen the miner's tools. But the forge</seg><seg type="columnLine">was packed on his little gray burro now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of their first day of tortuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">plodding, they were down among the foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills, and the first night they camped beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mountain stream. The woman had a dog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent and quilted pads and Angora rugs, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three men and the boy bedded them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves under the stkrs. Johann, sullen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and suspicious, unrolled his blankets near</seg><seg type="columnLine">John's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where they lay, and before sleep might</seg><seg type="columnLine">transport them safely hence, they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the woman humming to herself in her 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent. It was singularly disturbing. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearness was a palpable tiling, and she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not letting them forget it. The low notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuddled deeper in the pillow of silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep-laden, dreamy, dying. At last one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the men threw off his blankets and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. It was Johann. His blocked-out</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure strained toward the tent. The sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">very blur of canvas was filmy, like a veil in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft haze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Man, lie down! What the -"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">growled Old Jock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gruff Old Jock wanted to sleep. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">something peremptory was in his growl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann jerked back his head and his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardened into great sledge-like fists at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. But Johann did not know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon John might have trained on him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he muttered a bit but subsided back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his blankets just the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning while John was trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stake his mule where it had other views</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the matter, he got a kick that put his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left arm in a sling. John swore it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, and sympathy only made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">madder, but Johann's gaze lingered on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandaged arm with brooding earnestness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward, at breakfast, which was spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a fiat rock near the creek, Johann kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the woman. He was so persistent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this that he might have been goading him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self by each rustling movement of her body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the fragrance of her in each breath he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew--goading himself on to some wild and</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret project. She was between him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">John, indolently snipping off bits of pone</seg><seg type="columnLine">crust with her even white teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while, when it suited her mood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she let Johann have the thrall of her big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, smoldering black eyes, and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time she let her hand that was nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">John come to rest over John's hand. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">148</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at the quick thickening of storm between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann's brows, she lazily arched her own,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if asking him in so many words what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to do about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JOHANN'S cumbrous wits floun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered. He was maddened past en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">durance, and, yet he lacked provo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation. He had no call to attack John,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who hadn't so much as noticed the woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">caress. But Johann tortured provocation</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of nothing. He slapped at a gnat, miss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it, and his hand was cupped to slap</seg><seg type="columnLine">again when his frown focused on stolid, im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pervious John.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You object, eh?" Johann roared, thump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his chest and jumping to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Johann could not pass behind the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get at John because of the creek and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">treacherous sands at her back. So he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go around the camp-fire. But the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in his way, squatted tailor-fashion by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire mending a broken cinch-buckle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann lurched over the boy and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked him in the side. The thud of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned Sam sick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The boy staggered to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You b-big bruiser!" the boy sobbed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying where he stood; but with the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasp he had been using he belted Johann</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the knuckles and hurled it at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Even when Johann swept him under foot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy wrapped his arms about the ankle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Johann's boot and held on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But John--old Jock himself--was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. John had slipped his bandage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had rushed to save the boy. John's arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not broken, as Johann had hoped; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">big as John was--inches bigger every way</seg><seg type="columnLine">than thick-set Johann--he was soft and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsy and unbelievably dense. John just</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut his eyes and slugged. Jonathan Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have wept for the old blunderhead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The most tremendous body wallops rained</seg><seg type="columnLine">on old Jock only beat a grunt out of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At first Johann seemed surprised and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerted because John could not realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was licked. Then it infuriated Johann</seg><seg type="columnLine">because John kept on. The boy was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to Johann's boot, too; but Johann</seg><seg type="columnLine">savagely kicked himself loose, ran to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, scooped up live coals in the frying-pan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dashed them in John's face. John</seg><seg type="columnLine">fended with one arm across his eyes, blindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">groping with the other hand, whereupon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann leaped and bore him to the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They rolled, snarling like jaguar cats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jonathan Sam gaped. What had started</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, anyway? Oh, yes, a gnat bite. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was perched on a rock like some</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful valkyr above the obscene clamor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting, waiting; and in that she was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">harpy, too, though damnably beautiful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this valkyr was not interested in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">souls of heroes, nor this harpy in any man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead flesh. Rather was she the lioness</seg><seg type="columnLine">feigning unconcern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Jonathan Sam looked at her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thence to the two giants heaving and goug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, he had a glimmer of horrified compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hension. Here was why Johann had toiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sluices. Johann had been laying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle, content to let John put on layers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paunch. Sam marveled at the terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">singleness of purpose behind Johann's pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tient cunning. He stood aghast at dull,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwieldly Johann obsessed by a dream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">winning Suprema and become this maniac</seg><seg type="columnLine">of swift destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Sam recalled times when Johann</seg><seg type="columnLine">had scowled at him, too, so that now Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">distrusted Johann's past friendliness. Ev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erything once seeming decent and loyal</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Johann began to look like treacherous</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculation, and only Johann's scowl was</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest stufi. Sam saw his own turn com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing next. Sam was lean and rangy, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">without training; Sam's fists packed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more punch than a sofa-pillow. Yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that he ought to pitch in, or Johann</seg><seg type="columnLine">would finish them off singly. Sam knew he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought, yet it didn't seem fair--two to one--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he chose to stand by and let them fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out, which was a difficult business when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they jostled and sideswiped him, and mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered abuse, if he yelled at them to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy made it hardest. When Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the look on that boy's face, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manhood in him cringed for shame. Why--</seg><seg type="columnLine">why--had he not rushed in when Johann</seg><seg type="columnLine">first drew back his boot? Well, Sam had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not believed that Johann could do it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thing itself had left him dazed. But if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were to do over again ... If ... .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hand was laid on his shoulder, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam found the woman beside him. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little nestling movement she dovetailed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers of both hands over his forearm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her gaze drifted to the two men beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other to pulp for her; then back again</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at Sam, and her brows arched in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow, questioning way of hers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Great Foolishness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">149</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sam twisted his arm free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know that stuff! You handed it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann," he cried roughly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed. His anger was "score one"</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ■''Your chance, boy--baby!" she mocked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And," she whispered, "there won't maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">never come another."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sam frowned the blacker because his pulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped. He understood her all right. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him now clean up Johann, and with John a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck, who was there left to interest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady? Who but Jonathan Sam?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was brought out of that by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">groan that could not be quite smothered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He caught the woman by the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That boy lying there, go to him! What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter with you anyway--you, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman? Don't you see he's hurt?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her smoky eyes rounded wonderingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sam pushed her aside and ran to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy. With water from the creek in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat he bathed the boy's white, twitching</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and tried to wash out the jagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">gashes. From the bottom of a constricted</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart Jonathan Sam cursed Johann. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman came and stood over him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him curiously at his ministrations</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one watches the devotee of a strange cult.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tenderness toward the weak was a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult for Suprema.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam looked up; not at her, but at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men. There had been a pause in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle while John and Johann lay wheez-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for breath, each with fingers grappled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the other's shirt. Now they had started</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. With each buckling up of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies Johann always strained to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his weight in the direction of the creek.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His purpose was clear. Once at the brink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would suddenly break all holds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust John over. The quicksands would</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish John. On they went, John cran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his neck to snatch a glimpse of where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were bound. Once, for a second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam caught John's eye, bloodshot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, Jock," Sam shouted, "these are</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirrous times, old dear!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over they thumped again, Johann be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath ; but in the instant of going over him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, John flung out a leg, dug his heel into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground and dropped athwart Johann's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest. With his hands and his weight on</seg><seg type="columnLine">top, he clamped Johann's shoulders down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the camp-fire's patch of live coals just</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath. Johann ripped forth a howl, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">became a frenzy of flopping and agony and</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment. He had overlooked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch of live coals in his path. But old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jock had not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During an anxious moment Sam hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Johann might now be scorched back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into decent citizenship. But not for long</seg><seg type="columnLine">could John smother down the whale-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaving under him. John was bucked off</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last, and only by a split second got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet first. Johann made for the creek,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and frantically doused water over his burns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But John was coming, and Johann did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait. Snatching up a canteen, passing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman on the way, who met his insane</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare with a Mona Lisa smile, Johann</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled up the steep face of the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff, showering his pursuer under a land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slide of rock and gravel. He dropped be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind a ledge, and gave himself over to nurs-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his wounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JOHN came back, battered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">weary, but with a stubborn light in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye. Among their dunnage he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found first Johann's cartridge belt and pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol and then his own. Johann's pistol he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed into the creek. His own he aimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fired twice. At each shot one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann's two pack-mules dropped as if all</seg><seg type="columnLine">four legs were cut away by a scythe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johann came pounding down from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean by that?" he roared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What do you mean by that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm meaning a fight," said John grimly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"a fair fight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fair?" screeched Johann. "You call it</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair, killing my mules? How'll I tote grub</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough? You want to starve me--that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--starve me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John nodded his hard head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said John, "that's it. And while</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are starving some, I'll be hardening up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that way we'll both work around to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">even-Steven condition for the finish. I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose you understand, Johann, that it's got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go to a finish now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Johann screeched some more about</seg><seg type="columnLine">starving, and shrugged his shoulders. Jo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hann needn't starve, John reminded him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was only a day back to Placer Sands;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann could go on back there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that the woman laughed, and Johann</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked and saw that she was looking at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The slow smile was creeping about her lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann could go back and not starve; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">150</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she would not go back with him. To go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back was to give her up. Johann turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">again on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll whip you now!" he yelled, coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">at John. "I'U whip you on a full stomach!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John's overstrained tendons jerked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees as he tried to get set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right--waiting for you," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Game old rooster!" Sam murmured af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectionately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That he was not soon a gone one was due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to no lack of deadly purpose in Johann's</seg><seg type="columnLine">seething ferocity. But Johann's knuckles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were raw from the boy's rasp, and the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving muscles down his back were drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stiffening from his bums. Each smash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blow he dealt cost him a fiercer wrench</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pain. Only his maniacal fury kept him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it, and at that he twisted his slobbered</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth into frightful grimaces with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate fee-faw-fum notion of scaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">John into a blue funk. But John went right</seg><seg type="columnLine">on wildly pummeling and talcing what</seg><seg type="columnLine">came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the end--for there's no need to cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">log the buffets of the exhausted giants--</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were half-kneeling, half-crouching on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, each holding the other off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus they glared eye to eye out of puffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lids, their huge arched chests laboring, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fell apart. They lay as they fell, eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">distended and wary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman sighed and shrugged her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and went back to her tent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little caravan did not continue its</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey that day. Jonathan Sam did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflect that he might, perhaps, have gone on</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone with Suprema. Instead he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for his cousins until they could travel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he would not leave the boy. Of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman Suprema he was not observably</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking at all. She was both indignant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and puzzled. She couldn't figure him out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was it they called it in the vegetable</seg><seg type="columnLine">world when some cabbage or other jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reservation? Oh, yes--a sport. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jonathan Sam was a sport--that kind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes, and he was a vegetable, too!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Sam knew the perils to the lone</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveler in the arid waste they had yet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross. They would all need each other;</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly, too. Sam cursed Johann again when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought of the desert. He almost cursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman. It was up to him to stay sane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get them all safely across.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stayed where they were that day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that night. John slept with his pistol</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">under his hand, his stuff about him, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse and mule staked near, and he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep with one bad eye half-open. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he awoke at dawn he perceived Jo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hann loading a gray burro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's my jack!" cried the boy. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stole my grub-sack, too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, Jo," said Sam, "the child's</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to eat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that so?" retorted Johann.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He can't walk, either," said Sam, "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way you beat him up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Serves him right, the meddling brat!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneered Johann.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John aimed his pistol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry, lad," said John, but he fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dropped the gray burro dead. "Sorry,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he repeated, but Johann had to be licked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was the sole issue and consideration</seg><seg type="columnLine">with John.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quit your worrying, kid," said Sam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've got plenty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Which was true. With his usual luck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam had six burros besides his saddle-mule.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The burros had been left on his hands by</seg><seg type="columnLine">two prospectors whom he had grub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">staked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let you ride the mule, too," Sam added.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Meant to hoof it anyway.

"I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">go get it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johann ran to the dead burro, and swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">its pack to his own shoulder.

You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with him, or scared of him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Deliver the freight and I'll pack it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated Sam. "But don't expect me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take John's gun away from him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," said Johann, "all right. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait--that's all--wait--and remember!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He spat to underscore his threat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped his hand across his mouth. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dragged back the pack and sorted out</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he would carry and burned what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must leave behind. The latter included</seg><seg type="columnLine">much that he had stolen from the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the heat of the day they were out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the foothills and halted beside the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool of the dwindling stream from which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was possible to dip water. Beyond lay a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage-pocked waste, rimmed by a copper</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon. They rested here till night, filling</seg><seg type="columnLine">canteens, water-skins and Sam's six empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">kegs; but an hour after sundown found</seg><seg type="columnLine">them moving through a luminous haze like</seg><seg type="columnLine">lavender and stardust in solution, threading</seg><seg type="columnLine">their course among endless purpled clumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brush and yucca.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman rode in the lead. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted palfrey-fashion on a tireless little</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustang. Behind her plodded her string</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pack-horses, burdened mostly with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regalia accessory to her lure. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">humming her song again, and especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it like a siren's song as the men followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her into the trackless wilderness. Often</seg><seg type="columnLine">she looked back, at first hopefully, then in</seg><seg type="columnLine">haughty petulance. The first of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Jonathan Sam. Sam leaned against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mule as he walked, so as to hold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick boy in the saddle. Sam might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been walking beside Suprema, of course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Undeniably she was at sea regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEHIND Sam's outfit came John's</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle-horse and pack-mule, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after them trudged big John him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. At times John rode, but according as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his big, soft, bruised body would let him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolutely he walked. Old Jock was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">training now. Using his pistol for menace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he jealously guarded the distance between</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mule with its precious burden of food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and the bent, solitary figure of Johann.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that Johann had of food, he carried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back, and a bulging water-skin atop of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. Even so, Johann carried other weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was neither food nor drink. Strung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his belt hung small canvas sacks, round</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tight as cannon-balls and as heavy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nuggets and dust were in them, his clean-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Placer Sands. The sacks swayed gently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching; then one slipped its thong</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dropped. But Johann checked an</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse to kneel and salvage the scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust. Already he knew that in time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must jettison all the gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fingered the hasp of a hunting-knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its sheath. Imperceptibly he lengthened</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stride, bringing him slowly nearer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving shadow there ahead, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">John's mule.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the first rays streaked the east and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mystery of stardust and lavender had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed to a gray desolation, John stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fill his canteen from the water-skin on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mule. But the tumorous-like bag had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone flat during the night. Through a slit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hide, the water had drained. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting-knife--Johann's--lay between two</seg><seg type="columnLine">grub-sacks beneath the collapsed water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin. Without a word John hurled himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Johann.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johann went down, but parrying with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one arm, he slipped off his pack-straps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">labored to his feet. Although John's ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific punches lacked steam, it was apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the first margin of difference between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two adversaries had narrowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam, hurrying back to them, stopped short</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stare at something else--something half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden behind a cactus--a dirty grayish</seg><seg type="columnLine">head with pointed ears and lolling red</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue. The beast's eyes, intent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning, were on the weakening combat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants. Sam had a feeling that other gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms infested the sage, and at a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him he clapped his hand to his pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol. But it was only the woman who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridden up behind him and was quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">152</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," said Sam, getting mad, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">aren't scared of wolves, then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dear me, no," she laughed. "It's up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you--the three of you--to save me from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, isn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And a job for the three of us at that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam retorted. "But look at 'em--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comedians! They think they're fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you. They haven't the sense to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're fighting to give you to the wolves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You certainly ought to feel right compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented, ma'am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warriors had milled the alkali sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankle-deep, and grappled weakly. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">another deadlock. They stumbled apart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Water!" gasped John. "Water--Sam!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam slung off his canteen. But instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann twisted a bleeding fist under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you, Sam!" Johann protested.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Without water, this big bruiser is licked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you keep clear, Sam! You keep out!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I'm selling it," argued Sam. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it, Jock? I'm here to sell water at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one ounce of dust per one pint of water!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John nodded and took the canteen. -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the price!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, then," said Johann; "that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right, but providing you sell me grub,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, when I need it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said Sam; "come to me when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">need grub, and I'll sell it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," mumbled big John, "but he'll not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to you, Sam. When he tries it, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johann scowled from one to another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Eh-heh!" he burst forth with vehement</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasphemy. "I knew it! More of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotten fairness! The dirty two of you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in cahoots to murder me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Sam protested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This here shop," he said, "is open to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all comers. But you've got to be a comer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If some hombre with a gun keeps another</seg><seg type="columnLine">hombre from coming, that's not my fault."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Eh-heh! Eh-heh!" said Johann, mouth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing threats with his oaths as he got back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the galling harness of his pack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When again they stopped, Johann's pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked somewhat smaller. Not to be left</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, not to let the woman pass on for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, and to hoard his present strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his rival, Johann had begun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw over his future sustenance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But John, for his part, was likewise be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to pay. That same night John</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not drag his horse to its feet. At no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">price would Sam risk depleting his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">store of water for John's horse and mule.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The mule must soon be abandoned, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the next water-hole was yet five</seg><seg type="columnLine">marches distant. They had not gone far</seg><seg type="columnLine">when behind them they heard the wolves</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping and yelping about the horse that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not rise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Five nights later they still had not reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water-hole. Now, the morning after,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although the sun was high and the heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves like the breath of a furnace, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pushing on in stricken haste, all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them except Johann. The gaunt figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">emaciation that Johann had become was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer numbered among them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His tracks," said John, pointing, "th--</seg><seg type="columnLine">they-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam nodded. When he opened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, the air burned it dry. Already</seg><seg type="columnLine">John's tongue was getting black. Except</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy, they all labored on foot under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack now, even the luxurious Suprema.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boy drooped over the saddle-horn of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam's mule, and Sam's mule was the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tracks they followed were of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who went heavily, whose feet dragged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet the tracks ran mostly straight, or if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they weaved from the line, they quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened out again. The pursuers could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not cease to marvel at the indomitable will</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He was the first to fall last night," per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted John.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Latterly they had been making camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the first among them fell. Last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night it had been Johann, but this morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they awoke they had found him gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greater than fatigue, an insensate purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I tell you," cried Sam, "he wants to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">there first to fill his water-skin. You mightn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him, you with your gun. What else?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">John touched his tongue to his fiery lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then what are we hiking after him like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">- for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"God, Jock, he wouldn't! He wouldn't!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wouldn't? Sam, if you don't know the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">skut yet-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But he'd need dynamite--giant-powder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He couldn't wreck that water-hole unless he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, he could, if he's got plenty of time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Just with rocks he could-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurry, then! We haven't a full canteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. Take the girl's other arm. She-"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Great Foolishness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">153</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was about all in, as to that. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">note that Jonathan Sam thought of her now</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the girl, not as the woman. The change</seg><seg type="columnLine">dated from about the time she began leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing off her perfumery. Her regalia was</seg><seg type="columnLine">back there, too, strapped to the skeletons</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her pack-horses, long since picked clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the wolves. Suprema the opulent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbaric had come down in the world along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with those who would win her. And she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left off the animal lure as well. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam backed to the guards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I declare, Sue," he burst out, after deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">pondering, "I don't get you at all, any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surprise as much as a hummock of dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">made her stumble. Half-jeeringly he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to call her "Miss Supremacy." Now it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was "Sue." Moreover, she liked "Sue"</seg><seg type="columnLine">better, and she wouldn't have before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How, Sam? In what way?" Her tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">was eager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How in thunder should I know? But</seg><seg type="columnLine">you seem--well, somehow--cleaner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     AT THE word, the crimson swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her burned cheeks. But a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift glanced showed her that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was entirely serious. Cleaner? Well, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did sound like a joke, when she looked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at herself--a disheveled thing in grimy</seg><seg type="columnLine">khaki blouse and skirt who plowed along</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow in a cloud of whitish-yellow dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She thought of scented baths, of the lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">softness of her skin, the one-time rounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness of her slender body, the clinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">enticements of gossamer weave and but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terfly tints, and the sensuous ease of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood lazily coursing. And now Jonathan</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought her . . . She laughed, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a queer kind of laugh. But that was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause she had his meaning, which was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Sam did himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sam," she said, and hesitated. "Any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, Sam, I hope you are right. I--I hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started at the yearning in her voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his mule had stopped stiff-kneed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its tracks, head down, body gently weaving.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As Sam reached for the boy in the saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mule's forelocks curled backward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was down--finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More of the same," sounded John's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavernous rumble. "Lump o' Rock already</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight, too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam grimly waved John on. His trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye had also marked where the slate-green</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the yucca trees was possibly a little higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little thicker--meager promise of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oasis and water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John nodded and stalked on alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann would be at the water-hole already</seg><seg type="columnLine">--had been there, perhaps, with time enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do the thing they feared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam ran, overtook John, and gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">his canteen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All, Jock! Drink it all! Get there</seg><seg type="columnLine">quicker--go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John tilted the canteen to his lips, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not stop. Sam turned back to Suprema</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the boy. Behind them, in among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage, he saw ghostly gray scavengers sniff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward the fallen mule. But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no more carcasses to stay them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is, unless ....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam's lean face was hard and drawn as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hastened back. He steadied the boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would have helped Suprema as before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she shook her head impatiently and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put herself on the boy's other side to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. Her act in doing this brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">back Sam's perplexity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's this new stuff of yours, anyway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sue?" he demanded. "Have you gotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">human, or what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know, Sam, what it is," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was as helpless in her own bewilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment about it as a child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a silence as they fared on in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the torrid glare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After all, Sam," she began again with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange shyness upon her, "after all, it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">only fifty-fifty. You had me bothered, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam. Oh, but not any more. No, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got it at last."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It--what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," she said, "your being out</seg><seg type="columnLine">for yourself--that was perfectly intelligible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. It's what makes all of you as legible</seg><seg type="columnLine">as--as the 'one' on a dollar bill."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out for himself? When Sam thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had charged poor old Jock for</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, for freight, for riding a donkey, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">blushed to the back of his neck. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jock's dust to the last sack, now safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">cached with his own beside the trail. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had back his treasury stock, which canny</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Jock had once bought of him. He held</seg><seg type="columnLine">as security a block of shares in Jock's own</seg><seg type="columnLine">claims, for now it was Jock who owed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not he Jock. These transactions had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been most gratifying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Suprema went on, rather drearily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"your selling water at ten times its weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">154</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in gold was quite comprehensible, but your</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving it away, giving it to the boy--Jona-</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Sam, that had me stumped for fair!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam's grit-laden brows knitted. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered surprising her puzzled eyes on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he were a bug or a celebrity. Usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been when he was doing something</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the boy and not thinking of her at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't suppose," she said in a faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rueful tone of reproach, "you ever did get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl so pestered, or ever will again. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly were one continuing riddle, Sam."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Riddle, eh? Well, what's the answer?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The answer? Why," she cried, "it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that simple I couldn't see it. It was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">that maybe you weren't out entirely for</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself after all. Sam, it was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">so clean, stark, staggering new to me that--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under the merciless ball of fire hung in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky, the boy had gently sighed and gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp between them. With a swift back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward glance for wolves, Sam lifted the frail</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle across his shoulder and kept on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The woman's eyes slowly filled, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not puzzled, not any more. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at her. Yes, she was crying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Strength," he heard her saying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"strength," like a bitter refrain. "How I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have worshipped it--just strength--always</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and I never knew what it really was!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when I did understand--Sam, Sam, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too--too gorgeous for me all at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then--God knows I'm not mushy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam, and more's the pity, but--well, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked me up, and--and you can call it</seg><seg type="columnLine">new stuff if--if you must, Jonathan Sam."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was filled with sheer wonderment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I reckon," he said, "you'll have to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forgive me, Sue. Lord help me, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">was I to know you'd change so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Changed?" she cried. She brushed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying ends of hair to look at him. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">think so, Sam? Oh, maybe it's true, then!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe--maybe I'll make the shore yet!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If any of us do, Sue."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean the--wolves? If the wolves</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't stop us, don't 3'ou?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wolves, yes. But there was Johann</seg><seg type="columnLine">first. In his mind's eye Sam saw again a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin ribbon of water trickling down the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a rock, slowly filling a shallow basin of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. He imagined some haggard desert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat crawling to that thread of life, but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the basin shattered, the seam of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock a gaping fissure, and the flow rising</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">no higher than the sand. And now a maniac</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his despair and his hatred of his fellow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings was at that shrine of existence--</seg><seg type="columnLine">there alone, frenzied, resourceful. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, unless old Jock reached him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Make it or perish! Make it or perish!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam's heart beat the taps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But just because of the lengthening odds</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam's zest for the dizzy gamble of life was</seg><seg type="columnLine">whetted to a keener edge. His crushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">burden, pain, and the torture of effort--</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of it could down the eternal buoyancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gay adventure in Jonathan Sam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the arid, endless grove of sage, Lump</seg><seg type="columnLine">o' Rock grew well defined at last, a craggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">dorsal reef in a drab, dead, scum-strewn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sargasso sea. A mountain had thrust its</seg><seg type="columnLine">peak through the sand to become one more</seg><seg type="columnLine">synonym in the vocabulary of hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were close to it, so close that to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam's vigilant ears came the crackle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twigs tramped under foot. Of the cause,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, he saw nothing. A chute ran up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the rock; cactus and desert-grass were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick on it, and behind the tangled fringe</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of struggle was going on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam dropped off his pack, and carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy, labored on. The girl fell behind--■</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely he knew that she stumbled. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">head down, he fought the undertow of sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">between him and the rock. He heard stac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cato gasps and his thought was that even</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet he might be in time, when--not in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">but back of him--a shriek of terror jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">taut every nerve in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE WHIRLED, pistol drawn, una-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ware that he had let the boy slip to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. He beheld Suprema</seg><seg type="columnLine">running toward him, her arms raised. Close</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside her a wolf ran leaping at her throat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping its jaws. Farther back, sniffing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cautious but huddling for the rush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched the dirty-gray pack of wolves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hem of the girl's dress caught on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken stalk of cactus. Dragging it, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down on one knee. Her arms as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell she hel d outstretched toward Sam. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an instant when the animal's forepaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on her skirt; when, also, Sam fired in</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. The pack broke, scattering, vanish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing among the sage, their leader last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl's right sleeve hung in ribbons</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shoulder, and her white arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed 'round the man's neck as he stooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swept her to her feet and held her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Great Foolishness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">155</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are my girl!" he said. "My girl--</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you hear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her arm tightened about his neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sam, it was you from the first," she in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed him; "but I could not make you</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much as try to get me--you--the strong-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est and dearest!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The strongest?" he echoed in scorn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"H'm, just so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His scorn was for himself, because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone could not bring her safely through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He needed big John. He might do without</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann, but he did need big John, or Su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prema and all of them would go down be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the wolves. Which was reason enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">why John and Johann's glorious orgy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mayhem should come to an end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they were still at it, John and Jo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hann. Sam had forgotten. The girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">peril had made him forget. But this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">her peril, too. He put an arm about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and together they lurched and buffeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the sand toward the water-hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time no sound rose from behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matted growth, no trampling of brush, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-drawn gasps. The stillness was omi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nous and ghostly. They found the gap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a threshold packed hard by the converging</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks of desert prowlers. The half-shaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">place into which they stumbled was as still</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a church. But they did not think of that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Water was all their thought. On the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthful to burning membranes their souls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were centered. Their gaze sought the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rock at the end of the chute. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">they should see a tiny pool in a basin of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. Then realization petrified them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tracks. They remembered. Johann!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann had been there!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of him they saw nothing. Nor of John.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But of Johann's handiwork there was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which figured death--their own. The face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rock, for a height of two feet and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide, was broken down, the debris filling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hollowed stone at the base. Johann</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have had dynamite! And yet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole in the rock did not look like a "shot."</seg><seg type="columnLine">On his knees, groping for a trace of moist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure that might betray the rock's severed</seg><seg type="columnLine">artery, Sam threw out first a cold chisel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then a farrier's hammer? Now where</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the desert had Johann picked up a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">chisel and a farrier's hammer? Sam recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized them. They had belonged to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy. Johann had found them in the boy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">kit; had foreseen his need of them here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Food and gold Johann had cast away, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tools for cutting the life-thread of his fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low creatures were more precious to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam brought his hand out dry, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at the girl. Now that they knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, a warping grin twisted his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wondered, though, at the way her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes widened. He wondered what she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at. Suddenly he thought he under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, for he thought she was going mad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, maybe it was better. Better for her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor kid! One arm she held partly raised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended downward. The hand quivered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wrist like a leaf, yet he knew she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pointing, pointing down at him. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, cracked and flecked with dried blood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were parted, and her slack jaw trembled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Water!" she screamed, and slued over</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him in a heap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gathered her to him with a bitter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">defiant tenderness. But gradually he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came aware that her mouth was pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his shoulder, that it was held there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when he felt a fold of the cloth drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">between her teeth, in a kind of pitying hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror he forced back her head. Then, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, stared. Her lips were wet--freshly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet! He frowned deeply, with angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentration. He must not hope--it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too dangerous. But why were her lips wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that? He put his hand to his shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cloth was wet, too; cool and wet, so it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not perspiration. But what had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wet? What had he been doing to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wet? Well, he had been groping in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. He did it again, and noted that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of his shoulder was jammed against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper edge of the little cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God," he murmured, "God grant--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, daring all, he laid the palm of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on the rock where his shoulder had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed. At once moisture gathered be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween his fingers. He removed his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A narrow ribbon of water, so thin that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scarcely a film, coursed down the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rock. At the edge of the rock it</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell drop by drop. So, after all, the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derous beast, Johann, had not tunneled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep enough to cut the fine ascending</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread! Johann had again clumsily mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sue," he whispered. "It's all right!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He plunged his hand into the debris.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fragments of rock were flooded. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone basin was intact! They had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to clean out the basin, and wait while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drops fell one by one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">156</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But why wait? Let them find Johann's</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-skin and canteen, which naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann must have filled before beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">his labor of destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Canteen and water-skin, and both</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled, they did find after a little search</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the fringe of brush; but at that spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stood and gazed down on Johann and</seg><seg type="columnLine">John lying there--yes, and also the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three still forms lying there were un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speakably horrid because they were human.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had they been stuffed lay figures for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting of a desert picture, they would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been only grotesque. As it was, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">too grotesquely hideous for reality. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were too wildly disordered, too shrunken of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh and protuberant of bone; the coating'of</seg><seg type="columnLine">alkali dust was too spectral; the caked, fes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered wounds were too natural--as a wax-</seg><seg type="columnLine">works horror they overreached. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not wax. They were John and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann and the boy, and it was the finish of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The finish--but to associate the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">victory and a victor with it was but a grisly</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining for humor. Johann was lying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back. His gaunt face was upturned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tongue was bloated between his parted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth; and half-across his chest lay John,</seg><seg type="columnLine">face downward, fingers of one hand curled</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they had slipped from Johann's throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boy had had Johann by an ankle at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last. He lay so now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sam's features hardened into a grimace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "John's fight!" he announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two pointed ears vanished behind a rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his muttered words, and they heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the startled wolf making off through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait, and you'll get us all, you fellows,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Sam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An exclamation from the girl brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him 'round. She was kneeling beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy. She motioned excitedly, pointing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johann's canteen.

To become possessed of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">subaltern of the new army who was not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen--that in itself was a common virtue--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but who knew his job savored of the mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aculous. Flint himself, a second-lieutenant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of three years' service at the outbreak of war</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now a captain and in command of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">company, had all the regular officer's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctive distrust of those who had obtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">commissions merely because their country</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at war and needed officers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To his mind no one could hope to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">an officer, much less an efficient officer, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less he had had his eighteen months at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sandhurst followed by the long and gradual</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking in with a regular battalion. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he hope to learn the ways of the army,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its traditions and customs, the duties and</seg><seg type="columnLine">obligations of an officer after serving for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of months only. It was impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the face of it. More often than not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint's strictures were justified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Derrick was of a different type.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, as Flint soon discovered, was effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciency in the highest degree; eagerness to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only his own work but the work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">others as well, an eagerness that Flint</seg><seg type="columnLine">curbed most promptly; enthusiasm and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctive understanding of his men, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bined with sympathy and tact and a sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of humor that was priceless at such a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in such a place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flint, while purposely sparing in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">praises, announced after two days' observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that he had in Derrick the best sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">altern in the battalion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Or, if he's not the best at present," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "he will be soon. He can't help it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's got it in him, and that's everything."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Another of Flint's finds," said some one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wait till he realizes what the war's like,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint! Wait till he's lieen shelled to blazesl</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wait till he goes over the top! Why not</seg><seg type="columnLine">try him, Flint? Take him out on patrol."</seg><seg type="columnLine">158</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I will," said Flint. "I'm going to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out tonight to have a look at the Huns'</seg><seg type="columnLine">new wire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as Flint had promised so it was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That night he took the boy out between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was cold and very dark, the rain had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased, at intervals stars showed between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gaps in the driven clouds, and the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">moaned shrilly through the barbed wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">across No Man's Land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was little shelling, but occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursts of machine-gun fire from the German</seg><seg type="columnLine">trenches swept the open ground between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Flint and the boy crept slowly along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outskirts of the maze of German wire, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then lying motionless in the mud</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the star-shells hissed upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Once Flint heard a little choking noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">and glancing back had a momentary glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the light waned, of the boy's face, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drawn, as he stared into the ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide opened eyes of a dead Highlander</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging from the wire. But almost im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately another star-shell showed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all appearance unmoved, gazing toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the German trenches, and Flint knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he need have no fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A little later the boy gripped him by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow and they crouched down and waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">while four big Germans passed them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow and stealthy tread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When at last they reached the friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter of a small wet dug-out that smelt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rats and stale food and damp trench-coats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a sleepy batman had set two mugs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot coco on the rough plank table Flint</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the boy-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, kid, how d'vou like it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh! all right, sir.

That any one, above all any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his battalion, should compare the artillery</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the infantry with all their hardships</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sufferings seemed almost sacrilege.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For to Flint, who had seen his own battalion</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped out three times over since that Sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day when they had gone into action at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mons, the infantry represented the finest</seg><seg type="columnLine">branch of the service, the backbone of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">British army which had been sacrificed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save Europe from destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched the four subalterns curiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they chatted and laughed around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire; Stratton small and light-hearted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">restless, a student of La Vie Parisienne, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature of impulse, never serious even</seg><seg type="columnLine">when most in earnest; Mason, a West-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countryman, slow-moving, ponderous of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, and sound as the granite of Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moor; MacDermott, a big, raw-boned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irishman, much older than any of the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a silent man who spoke seldom and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">never about himself or his past; and Derrick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall and slight and wholesome-looking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughbred to the tips of his fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the youngest and the most reliable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND as Flint sat at the table staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly across at the stove he wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather sadly what the future might</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold in store for each of them. Flint's</seg><seg type="columnLine">creed was simple, unorthodox perhaps, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a high standard. That it was out-of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">date according to modern ideas he himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">acknowledged rather proudly than other-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wise. Briefly, to his mind it were better by</seg><seg type="columnLine">far to be killed or to suffer untold torments</seg><seg type="columnLine">in battle, to be maimed or disfigured, to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight or limbs, fighting for one's country</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to live out one's life in selfish peace and</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxury and safety without having risked</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Few of those who had landed with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Summer of 1914 were still alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had died at Mons, at Ypres, at Given-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chy, at Festubert, at Loos. It was the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were taken--always. Would any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those in the small farmhouse last the war</seg><seg type="columnLine">through? Would they see the Summer</seg><seg type="columnLine">green of the poplars along the roadside?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or the poppies and cornflowers at the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trenches? Or hear the lark's song</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a lull of the guns? Or watch the brown-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-gold leaves falling in the Autumn?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, though of a practftal nature and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">no means given to sentiment, Flint shivered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The best were always taken, of course. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hard, but it was war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "B'rVh'I I'm cold.

"Noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at all. That's why we're here. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man is justified in doing anything he can to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help his own people.

Flint, strolling along the fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trench, piled up high on both sides with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sand-bags full of chalk from the mines, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped to speak to Derrick in one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire-bays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?" he said. "So you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go out on patrol, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled rather as an elder humoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the request of a small and precocious child.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boy flushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not, sir?

"That's settled. I don't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lose you, kid, and--" he paused for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment and thought--"I tell you what,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd better take Corporal Dyer with you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I suppose you think I can't look after</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself," grumbled the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face was very red still and offended</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignity showed in his expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not at all," said Flint untruthfuUy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Only supposing you get into a scrap or are</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded!

I'll take Dyer and find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">what's happening."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flint looked at him curiously. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure was obvious; from his manner one</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have judged that he was going home</seg><seg type="columnLine">to England rather than that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">told he might crawl across No Man's Land</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the German trenches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon had set and the night was dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cloudy. The boy went out at midnight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint saw him before he left, chuckled at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerness, and then, when he had gone, fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to worrying. An unaccountable feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anxiety, of fear as to what might per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance happen, weighed him down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Calling himself names, he tried to shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his depression, and failed signally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the hours went by and Derrick did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">return Flint's anxiety grew. Supposing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy were wounded and had to lie out be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the lines for days; supposing he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed--whenever rifle-shots broke the still-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness Flint would find fresh grounds for fear;</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposing that they took him prisoner. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint this was the worst prospect of all. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a prisoner in German hands was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful fate a man could suffer; hell, unadul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terated. Better that a British officer should</seg><seg type="columnLine">die before that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At about three in the morning Derrick</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned. Flint, in the company head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters dug-out, heard footsteps descend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the stairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Other Side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that you, kid?" he called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," and the boy, his face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and clothes plastered with mud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Been out the devil of a time, haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" said Flint curtly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that the boy was safe he could af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford to show a certain amount of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noyance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I'm afraid so, sir, I've had rather a</seg><seg type="columnLine">job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flint saw that the boy was troubled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean by 'rather a job'?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not hurt, are you?

By</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way, sir, I think they've got a machine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun emplacement on the northeast side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They opened fire from there when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to move back.

I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">very sorry about it, sir, but I did my best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find him and--I thought I'd better be</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God!" said Flint.

The others had gone west,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or were wounded. And I kept thinking if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd only made them dig in quicker in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, or withdrawn a little in another, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone ahead at the double somewhere else,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or hadn't let 'em stop just where a Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson was going to burst--well, they'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">still have been with me.

Whatever you tell 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do, they'll do it, and they'll get killed--</seg><seg type="columnLine">by your orders.

And as for being respon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible for Dyer, that's ridiculous. Dyer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for you; that's why I sent him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS just after sunrise when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German heavy guns opened fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint listened to the screech of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shells overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are they crumping now?" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDermott.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">From where they stood they could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke of bursting shells rising from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined village behind the trenches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Giving the village a dose of it, eh!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well I'm glad it's not us, anyway," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The luck can't last, though: we're bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get it again before long," said MacDer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mott.

By God, Flint, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't want to see anything like it again."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did they do much damage?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The artilleryman laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Put us clean out of action. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct hits, right in the gun-pits: three guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed to blazes. We've lost three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters of the battery, killed and wounded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dug-outs got hell. The other batteries</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the brigade caught it pretty badly, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like we did. I'm feeling fairly shaky, still."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Rough luck!" said Flint. "I'm awfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry, old chap. I am really." He hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated. "Old Garnett's all right, of course?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm afraid not," said the artilleryman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's that?" said Flint quickly. "Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">--not killed? Don't say they've killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garnett!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said the other in a dull whisper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Blown in half.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?" said a strangled voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Garnett killed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flint saw Derrick by his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Garnett killed!" continued the boy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why--why I was only with him two days</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago.

"Bridger and Davidson are killed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too; Mulcahy is not expected to live.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hesketh and Grant are wounded. Pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad, isn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Bad!" said the boy. "Bad! Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off and stared at the artillery-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with an expression of frozen horror, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the significance of what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard was just coming home to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God! It's awful. Poor old Garnett!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It was just a matter of luck, really,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the artilleryman. "They happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot us, that's all. So they let us have it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There were few men I liked so well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garnett," said Flint soberly. "And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's gone. That's what happens out here</seg><seg type="columnLine">--always. Every pal I ever had in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">army has been killed. Garnett was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">home on leave next week, too. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling me how much he wanted to see his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife and kiddies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Flint turned away he noticed the lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the boy's face and he knew that the war</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all its cruelty and terror had begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">already to leave its mark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    A COMPANY commander who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth his salt must take notice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ILSSsai all that concerns his company. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint made it his business quietly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">methodically to study his officers no less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than his men, lest in the hour of trial when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine must do the work of one double</seg><seg type="columnLine">or treble, nay ten times, its strength, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">small cog wheel should be unequal to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">allotted task and the whole mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">break to pieces under the strain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And if there were rare and depressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments, born of the never-ending hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships of a cold and bitter Spring and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainty of the future, when he had wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">and foolish doubts concerning Stratton or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mason or even MacDermott, never even</seg><seg type="columnLine">when things were at their worst could he</seg><seg type="columnLine">have any fears for Derrick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Derrick, young as he was, was splendid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In everything he undertook he proved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">value; his judgment and initiative were far</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the average subaltern's. Also his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit was too high to admit the possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of failure. And Flint knew inwardly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">however great the task that might be given</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the boy would carry on, undismayed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in spite of all would be successful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet as the weeks went by, Flint noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gradual change creep over him. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieter than he had been at first; he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">less to say and was more serious. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others were talking he would sit by</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, listening, taking no part in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation but watching each speaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently as though perplexed or puzzled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On rare occasions he would talk wistfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">of home and what home meant; Sussex, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little white villages nestling at the foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the downs, narrow lanes winding be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween hedgerows sweet with honeysuckle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wild roses, green meadows and little</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams and copses, and an old red-brick</seg><seg type="columnLine">house covered with wistaria and set among</seg><seg type="columnLine">oaks and copper beeches and elm trees with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big lawn and garden gay with flowers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue of the Channel in the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sometimes Flint would come on him sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, seated on the firestep, alone, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at nothing, lost in thought. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brigade was out at rest he showed an almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Other Side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">165</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pathetic anxiety not to be forgotten; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must pay his fair share and take his part in</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything. And always, in the trenches</seg><seg type="columnLine">or out, Flint had the idea that he was worry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; worrying over some deep problem that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was past all understanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To find an officer's true worth one must</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to the men. This was to Flint a self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For who can judge an officer more ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curately than the man he commands? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone can tell whether his officer be just or</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise; whether he consider his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort as of more importance than his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men's. An officer may be everything that</seg><seg type="columnLine">an officer should be in the mess, yet a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal failure in the eyes of those under him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if an officer can not win the confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and esteem of the soldiers whom he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead in battle, then he is no real officer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were better that he had never been born.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Derrick's men, keen judges each one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, adored him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This Flint learned for certain one night</seg><seg type="columnLine">in March.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood in a traverse morosely watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Verrey lights soar upward and listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the thunder of the guns in the North.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I ses to 'im, I ses, 'I wouldn't do it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir, if I was you; it ain't your duty, sir, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">it ain't safe!' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The words came to Flint clearly and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized the voice of one of his sergeants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An' he laughs. 'Sergeant,' he ses, 'if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all to think wot was safe an' wot wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">we wouldn't be here; we'd be at home</seg><seg type="columnLine">making munitions an' strikin' for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">'arf-crown a day, instead of sitting about</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wet and gettin' killed.' An' after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I didn't say nothin'. An' off he goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">all by himself an' later on I hears 'is rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">barkin' an' back he comes with an old 'el-</seg><seg type="columnLine">met as pleased as a puppy wot 'ad just</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinched an old shoe from 'is master."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did he get any one?" asked another</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dunno! He's a - good shot, any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way.

But Flint's a reg'lar:</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldierin's 'is job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flint chuckled in the darkness and went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way. What he had heard satisfied him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If any doubts as to his junior subaltern's</seg><seg type="columnLine">abilities as an officer had remained the men's</seg><seg type="columnLine">praises would have removed them. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had said concerning the boy, merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved that his own vi€ws had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">correct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But though Flint might assure himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no power on earth, neither hardship</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor toil, neither danger nor the imminence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death, could ever daunt or diminish</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derrick's courage or nerve, yet he had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">made due allowance for the effect of inces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sant rain and snow and fatigue on a body</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet keyed up to the hardships of cam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paigning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was in the last week of May when</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDermott first noticed what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">happening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Flint," he said, "if you're not very care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful you'll find yourself short of a sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">altern."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good biz!" said Flint. Then he saw by</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDermott's saturnine face that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious. "What are you talking about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mac? You're not getting a transfer, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me?

"The kid's going to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of the kind.

He found him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had half-expected, seated on the fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">step in the front line, gazing moodily up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">an aeroplane in the blue sky against which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white puffs of shrapnel showed up like</seg><seg type="columnLine">cotton wool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lowered his eyes, shivered as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold, and saw Flint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hullo!" he said.

Now listen to me, Derrick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm serious now. Understand?

It wouldn't be fair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would it? I can't go out, and leave them</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. It's impossible. And what about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that raid of ours? I can't be out of that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've not been over the top with the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet. And, Doc, I'm all right really, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">swear I am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even Flint, accustomed as he was to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's moods, was perplexed.

Of course they can.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'd far better do without you for a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time than have you taken away for good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, that's final.

Hullo! What's that? Bit of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate on eh!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood up and reached for his steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tremendous crash shook the dug-out;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the timbers rocked, as though in an earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quake, earth fell through the narrow spaces</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the planks supporting the roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stratton came tumbling down the steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps of the dug-out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!

And the noise of the bursting shells</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so great he had to shout. "I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to see what's happening."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God! Flint--Flint, you're never</seg><seg type="columnLine">going out in this! They're dropping heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff all over the place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All the more reason for my going. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to see after those poor devils of mine."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly he climbed out into the trench,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to shut out of his consciousness all</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of peril and succeeding only passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. Most men would have called him</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave, even in an army where cold-blooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">bravery was the rule--Flint realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no false modesty--but never yet had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he overcome his hatred of shell-fire with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">its infinite possibilities. Before each at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack or each spell of duty in the line, he felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater and ever growing need of forcing</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to show his unconcern. For, ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to Flint's code, an officer must</seg><seg type="columnLine">never show that he either feared or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">respected shell-fire; outwardly at least he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must appear oblivious of danger and devoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So now, when his whole being craved for</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety, for the shelter of a deep dug-out, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberately climbed out into the open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursing himself for so doing. For why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should he, merely because he wore three</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars on his cuff, lurk in safety while others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">common soldiers in rank but better men</seg><seg type="columnLine">than himself, suffered the agonies of hell?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If they could die, so too could he: if death</seg><seg type="columnLine">in action were to be his fate no power on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth could save him from his doom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slight rain was falling; the night was</seg><seg type="columnLine">acrid with the fumes of high explosives; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare of bursting shells lit up the blackness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their crashing and screeching stunned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses to a numbed and helpless terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flint, staggering drunkenly, ran up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short stretch of communication trench to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chaos and horror of the front fine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The screech of an approaching shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him throw himself headlong at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the trench, his hands clasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his head. There was a deafening</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar as of the heavens splitting, a blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash of light, the very ground heaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward with the explosion, and Flint lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his face, half-buried by a fall of sandbags</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stunned by the concussion. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he could not move, then slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making an effort he forced himself to rise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Near at hand a ghastly voice was shriek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing piteously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, kill me, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">God's sake!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flint shuddered and reeled on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the voice was lost amid the incessant</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of shells rushing down the steep arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to the tortured soil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flint stumbled on from one broken bay</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another, ducking his head as though to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shield himself from the storm of steel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing in the sudden geysers of flame flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward dark figures of men cowering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muddy trench or clambering into shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes. Some were silent, some swore foully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">incessantly, terribly, cursing the God that</seg><seg type="columnLine">168</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought them to this hell, one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing bitterly, another standing among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead in a part of the trench where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell had landed uttered wild and devilish</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughs as though fear had robbed him of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his soul, and he, as Flint passed, clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by the apn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho!

He shuddered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hate their methods, their deceit, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruelty, their army, their Kaiser, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own particular brand of God--they're un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean, Flint, like animals--they're not</seg><seg type="columnLine">human. I know--how can any one help</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing. They want to make the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world like themselves. I hate them more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I ever thought I could hate. I want</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to kill some of them, Flint, or--or be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">killed myself.

Not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Germans, certainly. There was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">something wrong somewhere; but the case</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was one that no doctor, however learned in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ills of the flesh, could diagnose or pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">• scribe for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well," said the boy after a while;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"what are you going to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You'll have other opportunities of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">killing Huns, Derrick.

Bitter as he was, he could find it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in his heart to pity those Germans who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were doomed to meet them in battle that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night. It was a quarter to two when the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">artillery and trench-mortar barrage lifted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and' Flint and his men went forward into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">No Man's Land.

Hallo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shell burst with a roar at the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trench down which they were walking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"By Jove!

The Huns are angry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't wonder," said Flint. "We gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em something to be angry for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The noise of the guns made talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult, and they hurried on in silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the muddy trench until they reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance to the dug-out where the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">privates still waited crouching against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand-bags.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything all right?" said Flint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any one else in the dug-out beside Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derrick and the prisoner.

Well, you'd better wait where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are. We won't be a minute. Go on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mac. You first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MacDermott stepped through the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and on to the stairs that led down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug-out. Flint followed, looking back over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder and listening to the fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracking of shrapnel bursting near at hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Other Side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">173</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And then MacDermott's fingers gripped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his wrist with a warning pressure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From the dug-out there came the sound</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of a low, guttural voice talking angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For a moment, Flint, his thoughts back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the trench where the shells were dropping,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could attach neither importance nor sig-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nificance to what was happening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Some one--the prisoner--was speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Why not? Why shouldn't he speak?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Why shouldn't he even speak in German?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He wondered impatiently why MacDermott</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had stopped: what he was listening for?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And then it flashed into his mind that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there were two people only in the dug-out--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Derrick and the German officer--and that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' neither could speak the other's language.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The German officer must be speaking to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">himself, then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All at once a strange premonition of dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aster stole over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What is it?" he said. "Why are you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stopping, Mac?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  MacDermott relaxed his grip on his wrist</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and moved on, quickly and softly, down the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">steps into the lighted dug-out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The boy, white to the lips, faced the tall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">German, who glared at him scornfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What's the matter?" said Flint. "Any-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing wrong?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't know." The boy hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"He began to talk to himself in German--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I didn't understand, him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At that the German threw back his head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and gave a short laugh. Then he spoke a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few, sharp words in German.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God Almighty!" said MacDermott</seg><seg type="columnLine">harshly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What is it?" said Flint. "What the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">devil's happening?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced from one to the other:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">MacDermott, his face like stone, grim and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hard; the German, smiling contemptuously,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his eyes half-closed, his teeth showing in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sneer under his fair upturned mustache;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Derrick, looking like death itself, so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange and ghastly was his expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For a brief space, while one might have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">counted ten, no one spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The German laughed once more and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bowed in an ironic manner, first to Flint,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then to MacDermott, and lastly to Derrick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then he spoke in English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I am afraidt, chentlemen, dot I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been deceiving you. I can speak English</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">well, but not so well as our young friendt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here can speak Gherman, of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?" said Flint. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't speak German, Derrick, can you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You do not believe me, hey?" said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German. "All right! Den why does he</seg><seg type="columnLine">not say somesing--dot traitor to Cher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">many? He can not. He knows dot der</seg><seg type="columnLine">game is finished."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the blazes are you driving at?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Flint roughly. "A traitor to Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">many! Are you crazy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Crazy!" said the German bitterly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mein Gott! No. I say it again. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">traitor to Chermany! He knows. See him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing was monstrous. So mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strous, indeed, so outrageous and absurd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it meant nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flint felt that he was growing angry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also he was frightened. Something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">happening which he could not understand:</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that was perfectly clear to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other three.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned swiftly to the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Derrick, what is it? Why don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak? Why don't you put an end to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this - foolishness? This swine here is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">calling you a traitor! And a traitor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germany, too! Why? Because you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting for your own country against his?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no reply. The boy merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared in the same dazed way at the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">German. So, thought Flint, might a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornered hare have watched the huntsman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His country," said the prisoner in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet voice. "Vot is dot? Dot officer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours is a Cherman; I am ashamed to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I am in your hands, chentlemen; if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you kill me, it is der fortune of war... But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is my duty, der duty of a Cherman officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make sure dot der traitor is punished."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stop that!" said Flint angrily. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat in the German's tone warned him</seg><seg type="columnLine">of danger. "Put your hands up this</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant, you fool, or I'll shoot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT before Flint could move, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he was still speaking, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German sprang, tigerlike, so swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">and terrible was his onslaught, and gripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy's throat in his two hands sent him</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlong against the boarded wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug-out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> P'lint jerked his revolver from its holster</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, with a feeling of savage satisfaction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired. The German relaxed his grip and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell with a clatter to the floor. Derrick</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoved him away and staggered to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">174</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">choking. MacDermott dropped to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees and turning the wounded man over</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his head. A dark red patch stained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front of his field-gray tunic. His florid</seg><seg type="columnLine">face had lost its color, and his eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed. Flint waited in silence without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest feeling of compassion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The German had deserved to die. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told black lies about a British officer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about an officer in the best battalion in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the British army. Death was almost too</seg><seg type="columnLine">good a punishment for such carrion. Der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rick, a German--the very idea was pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posterous. A lie? Of course it was a lie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reason fought and triumphed over sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picion in Flint's consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's gone," said MacDermott.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet," said the German; "not yet,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he made an effort to raise himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MacDermott slipped his arm under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and eased him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He may escape me, but--dere are dose</seg><seg type="columnLine">he will not escape. Chermany will neffer</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgive! He has told you lies--and--" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner's eyes were glazed and dull, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath came in deep sobs-- "and he has told</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies to us. He will die--a traitor--but I--</seg><seg type="columnLine">die--for Chermany."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His head sank forward on to his chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's dead, I think," said MacDermott,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he lowered him gently to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time no one spoke. The gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire sounded like distant surf beating on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shore. MacDermott frowning a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rubbing the blood from off his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint watched him curiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" said the boy in a husky tone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did he hurt you?" asked Flint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said the boy. "Oh, no!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder if they heard the revolver?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Flint. "I don't think so. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a dickens of a row going on, they'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly notice it." He stopped short, afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what he must say next: then with an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">effort he went on quickly. "A - He,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">kid, eh? What he said about you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy raised his hands and let them</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall helplessly to his sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said hoarsely. "No, it's true,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not English, Flint. He was right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm a traitor to Germany--because I'm a</seg><seg type="columnLine">German."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An icy coldness gripped Flint's heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As at a distance far away, he heard a stern</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice his own voice, speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm German."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're German!" He spoke slowly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though to let the significance of what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy had said sink into his mind. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">German? Oh!" He paused, pondering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But--you're fighting for us, Derrick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's why you're a traitor to Germany.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I see now. That's what he meant, isn't it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And at that the boy gave a low, mirthless</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Flint, don't you understand even now?</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDermott does: he heard. Don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand that I was--was helping them?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Helping them!" said Flint dully. "Help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the Germans!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then all at once Flint understood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt that he was being stifled, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must get out into the fresh air or he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">choke. His throat seemed to have con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted so that it was difficult to swallow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart hammered against his ribs, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a black mist before his eyes so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could scarcely see and a singing in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, my God!" he whispered. "Oh, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">God! So it's true, after all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said the boy, "it's true."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I believed in you--I trusted you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd rather have had you with me in a tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">place than almost any other man I've ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">met--and you're a German!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The very thought hurt him. It seemed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even now, impossible. The kid, a German!</seg><seg type="columnLine">An enemy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God! it's a-L he. It must be!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again and again he came back to that:</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impossibility of an officer in his battalion</seg><seg type="columnLine">being an enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the truth, Flint," said the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearily. "I'm a German--a German spy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was, at least: I'm not now. Ask Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dermott; he heard him talking to me. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll tell you everything from the beginning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must: I'm not quite such a cur as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think me, Flint. Maybe, when I've ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained, you'll understand. When I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member what you've done for me, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">how-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flint stopped him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Derrick.

How did it happen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It began years ago before the war was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of--thought of, by you, at least.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They knew, of course, and they had me</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained for this--just for this end. I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to England when I was quite small</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lived with my uncle in London. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Other Side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">175</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't an uncle, really, but he passed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, and to all intents and purposes I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same as any other boy at school."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the good?" he asked. "It hurts</seg><seg type="columnLine">--like--like hell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on," said Flint. "Finish it now</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've started."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And all the while there raced through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind again and again, keeping time to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding of his heart, the awful truth:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derrick, a spy! Derrick, a spy! Derrick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Flint, you remember what you told us</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night--the night the old French-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman heard her last son was killed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verdun--that a man must be ready to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">all to his country--to do what he's told to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do without questioning: that was what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doing. It was for Germany. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint, it wasn't easy. Sometimes even</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I was at school I funked it--it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">so hopeless--and then I'd remember it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Germany, the--the Fatherland, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed to smooth over all difficulties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wasn't quite old enough for Woolwich</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Sandhurst before war broke out but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to Sandhurst afterward. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no difficulty about that. They were clever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint--you don't realize how clever! No-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body had any suspicions about me. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should they? You didn't, did you? They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had money, influence, friends, everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help them succeed. And then I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out here. T don't think they could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known which battalion and brigade I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming to--I didn't know myself till I left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base--but they knew as soon as I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. Why?

All I had to do was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let them know what was going to happen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might have been killed by German shells</seg><seg type="columnLine">or bullets, of course, but what of that? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a soldier, and it was my duty to risk my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life for my country. They'd taught me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">early. Flint, don't you see that I was doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much for Germany as you--as you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">for England? Don't you see that it was my</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty to help Germany in every way I could?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I USED to go out on patrol when-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever I had the chance.

The cry came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint's heart. "Derrick, man, think what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're saying! Do you know what you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">just told me? Do you understand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've said that Garnett and Ills men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were killed through you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said the boy. "Through me</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garnett was killed. You remember, Flint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying I looked ill? I was. I've never</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt--I didn't believe any one could feel--</seg><seg type="columnLine">like I felt. There have been nights, Flint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I lay awake till dawn--just wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">what would happen to me and praying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">God that I'd be killed before you found out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was always frightened of that: always.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, it doesn't matter now. You know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it's finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what I'm getting at is this, Flint.</seg><seg type="columnLine">176</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I learned after I'd been out here a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks that I was no longer a German. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked an Englishman, I spoke like one--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's why I'm here, of course--and I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">like one. I wasn't German any more. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, Flint, as true as Gospel. I'd lived in</seg><seg type="columnLine">England too long. England was home, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only home I knew: English people and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">English country; Sussex and Surrey and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devon and Somerset: English fields and</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods and streams and orchards. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were home to me. And when I came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">here I had to do my best to go back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that meant anything at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All my sympathies were with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">British, and I hated Germany and what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germany stood for. They'd sent me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">England to become as English as I could.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd done so; but I'd gone further than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they meant me to. What else could I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">but hate myself? I'd seen the battalion</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the trenches, I'd got to know the men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to like them, to know what they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how splendid and fine and gentle, I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they suffered, what they'd done out</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, and I knew--and this was as bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">as anything, Flint--I knew that some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those men under my command, in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">platoon, would be killed because of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was doing. Do you wonder that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly mad at the thought? Are you sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised now that I looked sick?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Flint, I knew that bombardment last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night was coming. They told me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd been ordered to get away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trenches. I told them once I could work</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, whenever I wished--I could too--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I determined I wouldn't. If the men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my men, were to go through hell, I'd stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them. I'd stick it the same as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. But you wouldn't let me: you sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">me away. I couldn't tell you, could I?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You mayn't believe all this, Flint, but it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth, every word of it. I'd rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been with the company in the bom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bardment than where I was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And, Flint, I knew that this raid was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming off: I had known it, as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you did. But I never told them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had asked me if we were going to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in this sector: I said that we weren't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was a lie, of course. I wouldn't tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. I kept putting it off. It didn't seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair, somehow: and when I heard the guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night and knew that my men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being killed, I swore that I'd be in the raid</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I wanted to kill, to show I was English,</seg><seg type="columnLine">body and soul, before being killed.

If I'd died</seg><seg type="columnLine">out there fighting the Germans, as I hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die, you'd never have known--and now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">.what am I?

Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">Derrick Garnett had been killed. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the far-off days of Marlborough when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the regiment first carried its colors into</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle, nor through the years of fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">that followed, in Germany, in North</seg><seg type="columnLine">America, in the West Indies, in Egypt, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spain and Portugal, in France and Bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gium, in India and in Russia, not even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time of disaster or defeat, had the loyalty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and honor of one of its officers been ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A spy! A German spy! Flint whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to himself and shivered. One of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers was a spy! And Garnett was dead!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MacDERMOTT was the first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break the silence. "He's right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint. I heard that--" he nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the dead German lying on his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor--"call him a traitor. He said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he'd broken his word, gone back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fatherland--I dunno--he said a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things." He turned to the boy. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him that you wouldn't go on with what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were doing, wasn't that it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said the boy wearily. "He asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me if I'd known of the raid. I told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth for once. I said I had, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hadn't given them any warning because</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd never warn them again--of anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was not fighting for them any more."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint uttered a groan of agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!

One of our officers! And all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time I thought he was fighting for us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was fighting for Germany, doing his best</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get us beaten."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well," said the boy roughly, "what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are you going to do with me?" He waited</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a moment for a reply, and then continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What is it to be? Will you shoot me?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Make me a prisoner? Tell the colonel?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Have me tried by court-martial?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The boy was standing with his back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the table: he held himself upright, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">head tilted slightly back, his shoulders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">squared; his hair had been rumpled in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the scuffle with the German, he had a bruise</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on his cheek bone, his collar was torn open,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">showing his throat. MacDermott leaned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against the wall on the opposite side of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dug-out, his hands in his pockets, his face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">half-hidden by the shadow cast by the steel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">helmet he still wore, only his mouth showed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grim and stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Between them on the rough chalk floor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lay the German officer, his wide-open eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">staring up at the ceiling, his arms bent and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his fists clenched, his gray uniform stained</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with mud and blood. From a dark corner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the dug-out a huge gray rat, encouraged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by the deep silence, came out, but as Flint</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spoke, turned and scampered back to its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Tell the colonel!" said Flint slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Have you tried by court-martial!

"How can we stop it?" said Flint sternly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Derrick, there's one thing I can not do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It's out of the question.

How</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">can I? You did what they ordered you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to do--for your country.

It's that or--or every one knowing."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Derrick," said Flint, "I'll do as you say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I want you to answer me one question</seg><seg type="columnLine">before--before you go. Was there any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else on this side helping you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No one.

Any of your people?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as he spoke there came to Flint's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind the memory of the night in the farm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house when the old Frenchwoman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of her son's death and Derrick had</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked if in tune of war a man were justified</seg><seg type="columnLine">in doing anything he could to help his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy shook his head, and Flint watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him wondered if after all he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking under the strain. His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouded with suffering, a tear trickled</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly down his cheek, his teeth were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed deep into his lower lip, and yet, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though to prove his unconcern, he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said finally, "there's no one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">i78</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">No one in the world.

Do you mind?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's not much time," said Flint</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearily. "It must be getting near dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found it difficult to speak. Hardened</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he was to war's horrors this going out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die was far more terrible than anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had thought possible. His duty as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier was clear, yet he had need of all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolution and control to hide the pity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenderness he felt toward the boy whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">story he had heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Death on the battlefield was nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had Derrick died at the head of his men</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting the Germans, he would have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no pity, only sorrow that the boy was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer with him, and pride that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">met a soldier's end. But to die as Derrick</seg><seg type="columnLine">would die, alone and friendless, knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that by his very obedience to orders he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had forfeited all right to live, seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flint a grim and tragic mockery of all they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought for. Yet Derrick must die, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of Garnett's battery had died, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world was at war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led the way up to the trench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll stay here and let me go on by</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, Flint, won't you?

In the east the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky was a pale saffron. A solitary star shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dusky blue.

On the heels of this vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">migration immense freighting facilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang up. By the '6o's it is stated that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes as many as five hundred heavily-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laden wagons passed old Fort Kearney in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single day.

To equip and run this line</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first twelve months cost two million</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hundred and twenty-five thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars.

There have been attempts to show him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as lacking in American patriotism, as a pacifist. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">pacifist! Jack London was ever a fighting man. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">biography of him might aptly be styled A Fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Fortune. He was always fighting, against</seg><seg type="columnLine">poverty, against lack of education; he fought for</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity, he wrote for years before he achieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">either recognition or a bare livelihood; he fought for</seg><seg type="columnLine">years against sickness, with a body weakened in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very beginning by the lack of fair food and lodging,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakened yet more by stomach troubles, aggravated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the hardships of his travel in strange seas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands under unfavorable conditions, his nervous sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem largely smashed by tropical sun-rays in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snark voyage. His spirit maintained a false but</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrant virility. It was ever buoyant, ever gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous. I have known many days when Jack London</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought off sickness to accomplish his allotted task,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at the very end, he wrote until the final uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness overcame him.

He bucked his way to the mastery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of words, he never ceased to study. When naviga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was wanted he went at it while handling his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own roving vessel and mastered it..-Smiling. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a magnificent fighter.

Some idea of the magnitude of the enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise may be gained from the fact that the rents</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the privilege of using this water ran as high as</seg><seg type="columnLine">§150,000 to §175,000 in the total, annually.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">QEVERAL miles from the site of Eldorado is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town of Malheur, known in the early days as</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Malheur City," which was also one of the principal</seg><seg type="columnLine">headquarters of the early-day placer-miners.

One other thing is, that the language</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be learned if a man expects to ever amount to</seg><seg type="columnLine">much in business. You can easily realize that. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Frenchman or Chinaman or Greek comes here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he can not carry on much business until he leams the</seg><seg type="columnLine">language of the country, can he? Well, then;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's your position in South America, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the language. In Brazil you need Portuguese; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the other places Spanish is used.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Your knowledge of stenography is under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same handicap. Not many concerns can afford to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">employ clerks with only one language, if that one is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foreigner. There are, of course, a few openings;</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as Government offices having much direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication with America; but in general you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">find you need Spanish or Portuguese.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for your capital, I'm afraid that won't do much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than carry you down there, buy a reasonable</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfit, and keep you safe for a week or two until</seg><seg type="columnLine">you strike something. My advice would be to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a good agency--such as the Goodrich--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it down with you; then you'd have a standby</seg><seg type="columnLine">until your repair business got started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Monte Video, or Buenos Aires arc great cities, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal to Rio in every way; and the back countries</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer rather more openings than does Brazil.

Where it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not drained, there are stretches as big as a township</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which there is not a dry place big enough for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent.

Here, frankly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is what I think of Birmingham:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I regard it a pretty good Southern city, as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">climate and about everything else. Mosquitoes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save in rare instances, are not what we down here</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of as bad. The draining of dead water</seg><seg type="columnLine">has worked wonders with the mosquito problem,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and consequently with malaria, in most such</seg><seg type="columnLine">Southern cities. The sanitation, I understand, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to the thermometer rising to 130--that must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a mistake. The highest ever reported by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weather Bureau was but 104. The mean July</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature of Birmingham is but 5 degrees more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that of Pittsburgh. People there, most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, do not think of it as an uncomfortably hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in Summer. However, they are mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Southern people, while you are a Northerner. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be better if you could go down there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Autumn. If you go in the Spring, I advise you to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">as early as is possible; you will consequently get</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Summer gradually.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, negroes are generally accepted as the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">help in Birmingham. But it will be much to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage to investigate a little when you hire a</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro woman; demand references, I'd say, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">do a little telephoning to make sure those refer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ences are genuine. Handled just right, negroes</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the very best servants in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to electricity, yes, they have it.
