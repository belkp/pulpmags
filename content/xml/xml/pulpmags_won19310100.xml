            <seg type="columnLine">Science today knows that, if you rise 1,000</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">is about as good a vacuum as can be pro-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">duced with our most modern machinery.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Indeed, if it were not for this almost per-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fect vacuum, which constitutes practically</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the entire universe, there would be no such</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing as the motion of the heavenly bodies.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The earth and all of the other solar planets</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">maintain their perpetual motion around the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sun for only one reason, and that is because</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the planets move in a perfect frictionless</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">medium--a vacuum.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">If there were no such vacuum, the planets,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with their satellites, would long have come</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to a standstill.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Let us suppose, for example, that the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">entire visible universe were filled with a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fairly good, though not perfect, vacuum,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">such as that found in our incandescent lamps,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">where quite a few air molecules are left.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then the friction they set up against the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">motion of the planets would be sufficient to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">retard them as well as the other heavenly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bodies and they would have stopped moving</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">aeons ago. The mere fact that outer space</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is such a good vacuum is the reason that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the heavenly bodies will go on circling in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their orbits for millions and billions of years</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">without being impeded in their flight.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Furthermore, we know what happens when</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a meteor strikes the upper reaches of our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">atmosphere, which in itself is a fairly good</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vacuum, but not a "hard" one. The meteor</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is almost immediately consumed by the ter-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">as other heavenly bodies, move as fast or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">faster than the average meteor, and if they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">did not move in such a perfect vacuum, they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would be consumed in short order by the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">terrific friction, if their motion was not</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Of course, to the human being, the idea</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the vacuum may be appalling because we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cannot picture ourselves living in anything</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but air. We are in this respect much like a</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Thoughts of this kind usually lead to bit-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Glancing up, my startled gaze encountered</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sides and hull looked as though fierce fire</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had swept them. Yet the masts, stanchions</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">More than once I cursed to myself during</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">cate a different situation. The value for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jupiter is substantially correct, but the satel-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lites are much warmer. Why this should</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be true I am not prepared to say at present,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but nevertheless it is so. Io, revolving close</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to Jupiter, is around 200 degrees above zero</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">--twice as hot as boiling water. Europa</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shows a temperature of 96 degrees, which is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">just below the boiling point on earth. It</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is worth remarking, however, that water</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">boils at different temperatures, depending</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the atmospheric pressure. By placing a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dish of water in a vacuum il is perfectly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">possible to have it boiling and freezing at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the same time. We cannot be sure, there-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">but with Ganymede such is very probably</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the case. The temperature is a few degrees</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">at least, there must be open water on its sur-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The simple explanation of these phenom-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ena dawned on me in a burst of compre-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hension. We were in a strong magnetic</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">field! Nor was I too long in discovering</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">its source. The earth, three hundred times</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">turies to guide mankind by its effect on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">compass needle. In view of Jupiter's great</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">size, was it surprising that he should have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a field many times stronger? Given that,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the electrical and other phenomena follow-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ed as a natural consequence.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Let us refer for a moment to the effect</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of moving a metallic conductor near a mag-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">net. Under certain circumstances there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">will be a current induced in the conductor,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and according to the law of Lenz, this cur-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rent tends to oppose the inducing influence.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">There is a simple rule for remembering the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that of the magnetic field, and the index</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">finger the flow of current from positive to</seg>
