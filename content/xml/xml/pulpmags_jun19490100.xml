At last the leopard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail stopped twitching; her body became</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid as it set to spring.

She twisted, snarling, flinging her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet to strike Ki-Gor's shoulder. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a movement as fast as the strike of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle adder, as fast as the lash of a co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bra. But quick as her movement was, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor was ahead of it. There was a subtle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning shift of his tall, superbly muscled</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, a weaving back, a darting movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his left hand, and his powerful fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed on the great cat's throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leopardess was very large----taller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavier than Ki-Gor himself.

He held her at arm's</seg><seg type="columnLine">length as her forepaws lashed in futile</seg><seg type="columnLine">arcs.

After a couple miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a roar of falling water and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel of spray filled the air.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">island was narrow, only a few acres in ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent, bowered over with huge trees beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose vaulted tops only stray beams of</seg><seg type="columnLine">equatorial sun penetrated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From a towering tree of the island to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one equally high on the near shore, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge of vines had been swung.

From below, it could be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging slowly in the breeze that forever</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew up this wild stretch of river which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not been looked upon by a half dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene found the end of a tendril lad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, and climbed swiftly as the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched from the ground. She reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge and paused, looking down, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny figure against the blue sky. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved, and started with swift, certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">stride as the fragile bridge swayed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even such travel was too slow for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor.

He lifted Brend on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, cautioning him to keep a tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip around his neck. Then, as though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy weighed no more than a ngila monkey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went swiftly, hand over hand, up a ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dril to the high-swinging bridge. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found a vine rope, tied and ready. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">untied its end, pulled back, stretching it</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight, stood for a few seconds, looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river far below. Then, calling a final</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of caution to the boy on his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, he wrapped the vine rope around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left wrist and leaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swung down, down with the swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of a diving eagle. Brend screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and might have fallen, but Ki-Gor seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with his free hand. The rope was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed to the exact center of the bridge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They swung like a long pendulum, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftness of their passage making wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn their faces, and their hair straighten</seg><seg type="columnLine">out behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they were no longer descending.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were at the bottom of the arc, flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">level with the river, its white-running</seg><seg type="columnLine">froth just beneath their feet. And next</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, up, until it seemed they would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop. At the very crest, Ki-Gor laughed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twisted about his eyes seeking Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was only a tenth of the distance across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge. And the next second, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">alighted at the island end of the bridge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet touching the tendril and bamboo</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk as lightly as an eagle feather striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. The crossing had been made in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are slow, copper-haired one!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to Helene.

The path led to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny clearing with a small house at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.

"It is some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that comes to me-here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They slept, and in the morning they</seg><seg type="columnLine">left with blue mist still hanging over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. The scent of the jungle rose around</seg><seg type="columnLine">them-the incredible fragrance of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen blossoms mingled with pungent odors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fungus and decay. Night prowling ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals had gone to their dens, and only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chorus of birds and the inevitable chatter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of monkeys interrupted the crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">stillness of morning. Marmo went stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily, following a narrow footpath, the sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his huge body brushing the narrow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle walls, carrying with effortless ease</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the ones on his back-Helene, Brend,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ngeeso, and Ki-Gor himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From time to time, without uttering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, Ki-Gor would seize a low hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">vine and disappear into the vast ocean of</seg><seg type="columnLine">treetops overhead. Marmo would trudge</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, never glancing or waving an ear at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">these strange antics of his master. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">others would ride for what seemed a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, then, unexpectedly, Ki-Gor would</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear, dropping lightly to the elephant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">back from the overhanging jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That evening, after being gone for</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer than usual on one of his mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">trips, Ki-Gor said,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is a clearing ten miles distant on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little trail branching to the north.

Reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing higher ground, they found an ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">footpath striking northeast through the do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains of Shuli and Bantu tribesmen. To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the close of the fifth day, the camel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">humped mountain rose at their left, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sixth they saw a jagged horizon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">purplish and remote through primeval</seg><seg type="columnLine">mists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is there!" cried Brend, standing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marmo's swaying back, dancing on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">small feet from excitement. "It is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge of Ramfis! Ki-Gor's magic has led</seg><seg type="columnLine">us back by the identical trail that Kal-ab</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After sighting the ridge of Ramfis, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor hunted the remote back paths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jungle.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind was wrong, carrying his scent to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills, but that did not stop him.

Ki-Gor's keen nostrils</seg><seg type="columnLine">were distended a little, catching the char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acteristic unpleasant odor of the anthra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poids.

He detected soft, rustling move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments ahead of him, and behind. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were red-lidded, savage eyes watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">from trees, and brush, and rocks, but Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor walked on, seeming to be as casual</seg><seg type="columnLine">and relaxed as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there was a different kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement. Abrupt. He sensed what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming, and spun around. A gray-black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairy form was charging from behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted thorn tree. A huge bull ape. Mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive-almost on the scale of a gorilla.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As Ki-Gor saw him, the beast roared, ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to his bowed hind legs, throwing high</seg><seg type="columnLine">his massive, hairy arms, his yellowish</seg><seg type="columnLine">fangs flashing in the dim, evening light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST BEASTS OF.

The bow bent under his mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, and the arrow was driven with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of a swinging axe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a perfect shot.

Another bull bounded out, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rose to charge, Ki-Gor smashed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with a second arrow. A third ape</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed out. Ki-Gor spun, fixing an ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, bending the bow. . He hesitated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched with grim satisfaction as the bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused, and retreated on all fours with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly rump thrust high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's arm relaxed.

There was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruling class of brown men who had long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago journeyed up the great river from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land where all is desert. And there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">black tribesmen, like Kal-ab. The blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">outnumbered their brown rulers by eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one, and they were brave fighters, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">through superior intelligence the brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">men kept them in virtual slavery Across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, Brend said, a tribe of cannibal</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks called the Batolo had held sway for</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries. Sometimes the Batolo would</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross the river and steal a woman or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were working in the Ramfis yam</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields, but generally they kept the peace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, despite their savagery, they were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">match for the well-disciplined army of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ramfians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the sand of the cave floor, Brend</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew maps of the valley, the city, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans of the bamboo and ironwood houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the brown men, while Ki-Gor watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently, fixing each picture in his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brend told much of Durga-Rama; of Ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenna, the virgin; and of his friend, Liike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high-priest of Isis. He also told of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger that waited, of the merciless treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment accorded spies, of the great Arab</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs which were kept chained to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm when strangers entered the walled</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of the brown men, and of the savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion, Panthra, which Durga-Rama had</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained to guard him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the first sign of dawn, Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the cave. He walked rapidly down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope toward Ramfis. As the scrub growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was left behind, and the jungle became</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep, he seized a vine and swung to a tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb. He moved from tree to tree, swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in easy arcs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not hurry. He did not want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the city of Ramfis before dark. For</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes on end he would pause and stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on some high, swaying limb, perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">blended into the pattern of the jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching for some telltale movement. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see none.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When evening came, Ki-Gor was close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the city of Ramfis. Hand over hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">he climbed the huge branches of a baobab</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree, and perched near its top to watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All was as Brend had diagramed. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a large native village of thatch huts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a circular stockage enclosing the more pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentious houses occupied by the brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">rulers. He recognized from Brend's de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scriptions the palace of Durga-Rama, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ampitheatre where gladiators of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">race often fought on feast days, the temples</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Isis and Ra with the house of High-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priest Liike standing between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He mapped his course. He would scale</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stockade on the far side where large</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees of the jungle crowded close. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside, he would cross to the shadow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner stockade which circled Durga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rama's house, and enter Liike's house</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rear. His chief worry were those</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, Arab hounds of which Brend had</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned him. They might catch his spoor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and commence howling their alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Darkness settled. He dropped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, passed through the soft, wet earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a millet field, commenced circling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">native city. Tom-toms were beating, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could see oiled, black bodies dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a fire. There were no brown men</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing, of course. They looked with dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dain on such pleasures, preferring to lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">on reed couches and drink a sweet, pink</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine concocted of the juice of sugar palms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were watchmen along the stock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ade. Sometimes Ki-Gor passed within</seg><seg type="columnLine">long assagai reach of them, but so silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">were his footsteps, so stealthy was every</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement, that his presence was not once</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor paused on reaching the far side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would be easy to scale the stockade when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guards were not watching, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was always a danger that one of the dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">would scent him and raise the alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved back in the shadows of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great trees, planning another course. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these trees towered far above its fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows. He climbed it, examining the long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST BEASTS OF TA'TAMBA	15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ropelike vines that stretched from its high</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches. None of them swung with suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficient freedom to suit his purpose, so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut one and tied it near the end of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle limb. He grasped the vine, swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in a wide, gentle arc. At the crest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his swing he released his grip, sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear of the stockade, alighting in the deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows far beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood close against the inner wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">which surrounded the house of Durga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rama.

A man stood outlined in the slice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pale light. A thick man with vast shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders He wore a robe of white cotton and</seg><seg type="columnLine">around it a flowing scarlet scarf.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so close that Ki-Gor caught the scent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it on his breath. Due to the wine which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had somewhat dulled his senses, Durga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rama might have passed without seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Lord, even though they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so close, but Panthra turned, snarling, lift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one front paw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Panthra!" roared Durga-Rama, jerk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the huge animal back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KI-GOR could have killed the lion at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment with an arrow from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong-bow, but he still had hopes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoiding a general alarm.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Ki-Gor and paused. This, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, was his real assailant. This strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man. The pigmy on the ground could</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panthra faced Ki-Gor, hesitated a frac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of a second with muscles tensed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">belly dragging the ground.

His leap would carry him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, taking man to earth. His teeth would</seg><seg type="columnLine">close on the throat, there would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crunch of bones, and the man animal would</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a limp mass of flesh. That was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the real sport for Panthra-to slam the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless creature, to shake him, the while</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling the good, warm blood running in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this time it was not the same. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man did not retreat as all the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">had. Instead, he had actually moved for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to meet the charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panthra swung his paws to brush aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor's hands. The hands were not as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected. Only empty space. It threw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion off by an imperceptible degree. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged fraction of a second he was off</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance. Pie tried to shift the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spring in mid-air. At that moment, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand came, quick as the strike of a snake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing like a steel trap on his left foreleg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panthra twisted, trying to free himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lashed with the other paw. It was the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">movement Ki-Gor expected-that he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seized the other leg, and flipped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great beast over in the air, side-stepped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slammed him on his back to the hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a short click of time, Panthra was</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">subtle shifting of Ki-Gor's body saved him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was at one side, feeling only the sting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sharp claws as they brushed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was crouching forward, knife in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.

He forgot the others, forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dozen assagais at his back, forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">Durga-Rama, himself a warrior and strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an ape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panthra retreated, reaching back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow, tense legs, his mouth snarling open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing his yellow fangs.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped short, and stood rigid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One move you die!" a heavy voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE did not move.

Death was only an as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagai-thrust away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lowered his knife, turned slowly.

Following that en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gagement, a wild boar was turned in with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lancer and killed, and by way of diver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, two drunken hags clawed each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their fingernails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The hags were finally chased out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expectant silence settled.

For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment there were no words spoken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guardsmen looked at him in hushed awe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never before had they seen a man of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportion, of such strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The king must not be kept waiting for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you, white man," said the leader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ki-Gor climbed the steps, crossed a nar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">,row passage lined with bamboo pickets ten</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feet high and lashed across the top, walked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through a gate to the arena.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood for a moment, allowing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes to accustom themselves to the bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant, late-afternoon sunlight. Then, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single, sweeping glance, he took in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">features of the scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The arena was about a dozen strides in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">diameter, roughly circular, surrounded by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a perpendicular wall about three times the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">height of a man. Above the wall, safe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the highest-leaping beast of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jungle, were the seats of the brown men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Beyond, on a circular platform, the blacks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were jammed together in a solid mass, re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">splendent in feast-day paint and finery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A roar greeted Ki-Gor as he came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. Then, as the roar subsided, taunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST BEASTS OF TA'TAMBA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">voices made themselves heard. Bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and pellets were flung at him, strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him, bounding to the dust at his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He made no sign of having noticed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes noted Durga-Rama, gowned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white kuftan with scarlet sash. Panthra</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay at his feet, lips drawn back from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fangs, his glowing eyes on Ki-Gor. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">Durga-Rama's back was a slave, waving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, ostrich-plume fan, and at his left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated a few inches lower, was a girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl was young-perhaps Brend's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tender age. She was beautiful. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judged by the classic features of Ki-Gor's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely Helene, she was beautiful. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin was brown, with a velvet texture; her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were very large, and dark; a thin robe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cotton was drawn around her young</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure which was just swelling into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of womanhood. She seemed fragile</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a lotus leaf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor did not doubt that this young</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl was Arlenna, whom Durga-Rama in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to take to his couch in marriage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor looked up at her, and for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment their glances met. He saw compas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion in her eyes----pity for the horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate that awaited him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">22	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Durga-Rama bent, and spoke to her. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid his hand on her shoulder, had his thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips close to her ear. She shrank a little,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though his closeness were loathsome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she nodded quickly. It was not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased smile. It showed that she feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man, and her fear made Ki-Gor detest</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as he had never detested a person be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's eyes traveled farther. In scar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let robes of their calling sat the priests of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isis and Ra. One of them, gray-bearded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sightless eyes, sat in an elevated posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. This, he knew, was the high-priest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liike-the man he had come to the val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If fate went against him, in his last ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremity, Ki-Gor would shout his message</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Liike. He would tell him that Brend</seg><seg type="columnLine">still lived, that he had been kidnapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the connivance of Durga-Rama,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that someday he would return. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">that only as a last resort. For the moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor looked at the sightless Liike with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sign of interest or recognition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor walked to the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arena. He folded his arms. His muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were long; they rippled like the bodies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pythons beneath his smooth, tanned skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two black men ran in, carrying a pole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the trunk of a palm, two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches in diameter, glistening from a thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">application of grease. Quickly they placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in a hole that had been bored close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall. When in place it weaved uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly, its top within reach of Durga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rama's arm. Perhaps it would bear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of a man such as Ki-Gor, and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps not, but its coating of grease would</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent his climbing it anyway. The pole</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely a bit of torture. It would pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vide a comic spectacle for the mob if a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrified man were to grasp it and try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb while the great apes clawed his flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ribbons from behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the blacks made an announce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. The arena was cleared. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">creak of wooden wheels outside. A dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves and guardsmen were pulling a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">cage. It was rolled to a sliding door, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was lifted, the cage opened. Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">could feel the tenseness of the crowd as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardsman with *a long pole poked be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the bars of the cage to force out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">some surly animal. There was a gasp, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry of pleased anticipation as a huge, gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">black creature lumbered into sight. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ape, shaggy and abysmal, turning, lim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber hands on long arms trailing in the dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Zag! Zag!" screamed the crowd, call-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the brute's name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was more shouting and poking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and another ape came out. This one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gombon," evidently. The two of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained near the entrance for a while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinking dull, red-rimmed eyes, growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to their new freedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Zag saw Ki-Gor, he made no imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diate move .to attack. Perhaps it took</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time for his dull brain to digest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that an- unprotected man was there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he opened his mouth, showing pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erful, yellowed teeth, and let loose a gut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teral snarl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the guardsmen reached through</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a barbed lance, sticking the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the back. The pain of the lance in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiated him. He charged, but the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quickly withdrawn, and the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast struck the arena wall, making it</seg><seg type="columnLine">creak and wave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CROWD shrieked with laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the spectacle. Once more the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lance, this time from a new direction. Zag</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat at the walls with his huge arms in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging fury, but the second ape, Gombon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely stood by the gate, rocking back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forth on bowed legs, his eyes on Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor still stood in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arena. He seemed relaxed. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still composed, still arrogant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his blind fury, Zag's eyes fell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gombon. He rushed, and suddenly stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped. Only then did he notice Ki-Gor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned, and charged with long arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushing the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a distance of two strides the ape</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowed, and stretched high his arms. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounced, swinging them down with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">force that would have driven most men</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the earth, a heap of broken bones. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the arms descended, Ki-Gor was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the final moment he had moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside, shifting with the quickness of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leopard-cat. He slid beneath one of Zag's</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST BEASTS OF TA'TAMBA	23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">descending arms. The ape was thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">off balance. He snarled with froth drip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping from the corners of his wide mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enraged that his quarry had evaporated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the earth in front of him. With an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort, he came to a stumbling stop, veered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his huge bulk around, But Ki-Gor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not there, either. Zag's half human voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose in a frustrated scream, while his</seg><seg type="columnLine">claws tore at the coarse, straggling hair at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own chest. And at that second, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor saw his chance. He sprang through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, pouncing with knees on Zag's</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, his hands feeling for the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">arteries of his throat to close off the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply to his brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ape's arms beat the empty air. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, flopping blindly like a monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had lost all sense of equilibrium and</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. He turned around and around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell to the ground, pawing over his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, trying to free himself of the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible thing that was holding like a leech</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zag rose to great heights, flinging his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms high in one final effort. His hind</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs seemed very short and bowed, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest became pointed, his belly sunken. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all massive shoulders and arms, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible, distorted beast, a thing conceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mind of an angry god and born in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the furnaces of hell. He flung himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward, trying to crush Ki-Gor against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of the arena.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor was jarred, and Zag succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in writhing part way free. He swung back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding the flesh of K-Gor's shoulder with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his claws. He raked three shallow fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows from which blood came in quick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet streaks. But the jungle man did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not relinquish his advantage. His fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">still probed the soft recesses of Zag's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During this time, the second bull, Gom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bon, watched dull eyed from a crouching</seg><seg type="columnLine">position by the gate. He seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no interest in the fate of Zag. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly he scented the fresh blood flow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from Ki-Gor's shoulder. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whet his savage appetites. He roared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd saw him and was in ecstasy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now indeed would they see the arrogant</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man defeated. He would no longer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be a conquerer, riding on the shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their mightiest beast. Instead he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall crushed and mangled with broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones poking through his bloody flesh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would see him become a limp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifeless thing. They would see him tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about by the two apes until they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired of playing with him, and finally they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would see the starved hounds of Durga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rama turned inside the arena to devour</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They watched as Gombon paused with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands uplifted, directly over the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor. They watched those arms de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scend and close on his naked back. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheered as Gombon reared back, the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in his arms, tearing him off the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Zag. But what followed after that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so quick that not one eye in the vast as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblage followed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a flash of Ki-Gor's bronzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">body as he twisted. Suddenly Gombon'e</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms were no longer around his body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead he was thrust back, those hairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms held wide and high by the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor released the hold, leaped back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, landed on the balls of his feet, knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent in a crouch. Then he moved side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise and sprang. His fingers reached,</seg><seg type="columnLine">funding the eyes of Gombon. A quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">twist of crooked fingers, and the ape</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for the moment blinded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gombon roared, his voice rising higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">and higher until it became a shriek. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered, arms lashing like some insane</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster. He collided with Zag, and slam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">med him to the dirt of the arena. He plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, falling, and collided with the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking it with such force it threatened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In their seats above, the brown men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were shouting from fear. Danger to them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves--that was a thing they had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckoned with. Durga-Rama stood, hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting on Panthra's collar, watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">while a scowl twisted his heavy face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor backed to the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arena, hands resting on hips, stepping</seg><seg type="columnLine">nimbly to one side or the other, avoiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blind rushes of the ape. He waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">his moment. Finally the beast was di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly between him and the greased pole,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing a full height, hands pawing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">24	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyeballs. It was exactly the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor had wanted. He went forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with two swinging strides. He launched</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself into air. One foot touched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast's back, the next rested on his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From that elevated position he sprang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasping the grease-slick pole in one hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his toes siwung on, resting at the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the arena wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the second he balanced there pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cariously, looking down on Durga-Rama.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE USURPER acted quickly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled, and whisked the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">scimitar from his waist. He leaped for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, swinging the crescent-shaped blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a mighty arc. It connected with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole, cutting it in half just beneath Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's fingers, and the jungle man fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward to the deep dirt of the arena</seg><seg type="columnLine">below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Durga-Rama waved his scimitar on high</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouted down to his guardsmen, "Death</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him! Death! Death!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Black guardsmen were swarming near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gate, the metal heads of their assagais</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattling together. They peered through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong bamboo pickets, fearing to disobey</seg><seg type="columnLine">the command of Durga-Rama, but fearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more the fury of the savage apes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally savage white man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor came erect, and his eyes flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the arena. His attempt at escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been frustrated, and now he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">only death on every hand. His eyes rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Liike who had stood, and was facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the scene, trying to piece it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">by hearing alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hear me, Liike," screamed Ki-Gor, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice rising over the sounds of the mob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Liike took a blind step forward. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear!" he said in a harsh voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have come to tell you of the true</seg><seg type="columnLine">king of Ramfis!

Liika kept calling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Durga-Rama leaned over the railing, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">scimitar clenched in his hand, an expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of black rage mottling his heavy face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seemed poised there, tempted to leap to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the arena below, to swing his scimitar on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hated white man, to cut off the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever with its damning accusation against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. But his fear of the great apes was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too strong. Suddenly he remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panthra. He spun around, cut the leash</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a whip of the scimitar, snarled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">command in the beast's ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panthra did not hesitate. He saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated white man below--and this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no sharp knife to strike at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with cobra quickness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panthra launched himself into air. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrill scream from the throat of Arlenna</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached Ki-Gor's ears. He turned, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was Panthra, poised above him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ki-Gor moved aside--one of those light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning movements that had saved his life so</seg><seg type="columnLine">often in the past. Panthra saw him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was unable to change the course of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring in mid-air. The huge lion struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth on all fours, spun, started to lunge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again Ki-Gor was gone. Cleverly he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted position, placing Zag between him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the lion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zag saw the big cait, and writhed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from fear. Sight was coming back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gombon's eyes, and he saw Panthra, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two of them fled, chattering their ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror. Simultaneously their weights struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arena wall. The bamboo bent, creak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. It wavered a moment. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp, splintering sound as one of the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side supports gave way, and following that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a roar of collapsing wood mingling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screams of brown men and black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A section of the wall had collapsed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wall had served as a main support of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the overloaded stands above.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Ki-Gor's chance to escape.

But his quickness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no match for that of the jungle man's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor sidestepped, felt the bronze head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the assagai burn past his chest. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand streaked down, seized the shaft, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST BEASTS OF TA'TAMBA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with a powerful twist, sent the black war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rior rolling head over shoulders to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guard came to one knee, shrieking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alarm, but no one could hear him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the pandemonium that seethed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the arena. He still had a weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a short-bow, and quiver of tiny, poi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soned arrows. He fitted an arrow in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thong and drew back, aiming at Ki-Gor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, but at the same moment, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinitely quicker, Ki-Gor's long arm came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, driving the assagai The copper</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the assagai flashed once in the late,</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon sunshine, aud cut the warrior</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the middle, pinning him to earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cry of terror that rose from the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rior's lungs ended in a death-gasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Guards were, running from their posts</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the arena now.

"Hear me!

Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept one arm upraised as though ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call down the thunder of the gods, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he backed slowly toward the ironwood</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate of Durga-Rama's palace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strength of that gate would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">defied Ki-Gor's strength, but he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">need to open it. With a vaulting spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward he reached the top of the eight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot wall. He crouched there, looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blacks, and still no weapon was lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Durga-Rama had by now broken free</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the terrified mob in the arena. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged from the gate, trampling men and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">women. He saw Ki-Gor poised there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouted,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After him, you cowards!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When his men still did not move, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared with rage, and charged them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his scimitar. He cut down two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them with the first savage swing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed on, scattering the guards before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That man is Ki-Gor," he bellowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You hear me?--Ki-Gor!

The sound of Durga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rama's bellowing seemed distant there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He reached the door. It was barred. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove into it, shoulder first, and it col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsed beneath his power. Five strides</seg><seg type="columnLine">took him the length of the great hall; three</seg><seg type="columnLine">long leaps, and he was up the stairway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He burst inside the private rooms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Durga-Rama. Only a slave was there--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman, sprinkling fresh thatch over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">couches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor saw his strong-bow hanging on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peg, his quiver of arrows nearby, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-bladed hunting knife sticking in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Guardsmen were inside the front door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could hear them in the courtyard, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Durga-Rama was issuing orders, organiz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor fixed quiver and knife at his belt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped the strongbow over his shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and climbed to the top of a thick, bamboo</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillar supporting the roof.

He speeded his step near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the roof, and with a bounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap he launched himself in air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed poised, like a bird in flight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sailed out a long distance, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, down. It appeared that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely impale himself on the pointed poles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stockade. He didn't. He cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stockade by inches, and ran toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the encroaching jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one was in striking distance except</seg><seg type="columnLine">a native archer. The fellow sprang to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perch overlooking the stockade, his bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and poisoned arrows in his hands. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder, Ki-Gor saw him. Still</seg><seg type="columnLine">running, the jungle man fitted an arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the string of his strong-bow, turned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drove the arrow. It winged true,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashing the native backward as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was struck by a war-axe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vine was there as it 'had been left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night before.

By dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the area of large trees was left behind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was forced to travel a footpath.

The apes should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be this close if they had any great</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of Marmo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He speeded to a run.

They were after him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashing through the tangle, stabbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their long assagais, firing poisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows at him by sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes they gave up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered around Helene, jabbering to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, staring at the strange sight of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">captive white woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their leader, a thick-chested man</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Mokotto, issued a gutteral com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand.

He was gone the time it takes a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to breath fifty times, then he emerged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chong wait inside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lift the drape for me!" snarled Durga</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rama, his hand closing on his scimitar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a surly motion, the man obeyed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Durga-Rama entered, and stood for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. The hut was dark after the bright,</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning sunlight. Uncured skins of zebras,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giraffes and jungle cats covered the dirt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving off an odor of dry decay. Four squat</seg><seg type="columnLine">women of the tribe were crouched in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper shadow along the wall, while a tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandy-legged Poltuni wench occupied a</seg><seg type="columnLine">favored position on a skin-covered heap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatch. In the center of the hut sat Chong</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chonk was large and round-shouldered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had once been muscular, but some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muscle had now dissolved into fat from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the easy life he led. His face was broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flat, his skin oily, his head shaved and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming like polished ebony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Durga-Rama!" he said, not offering to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are honored by my visit," growled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usurper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chong waited. All his life he had hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">these men of Ramfis, and that hatred show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed in his face now. But he feared, too, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was curious about this unprecedented</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit. Durga-Rama went on,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I come to tell you of a woman, Chong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A beautiful woman." With a contemptuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">twist of his lips he looked around at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chong's wives. "This woman, she is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ia short, bow-legged wench like those with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which you have contented yourself. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman is tall, and white, like a vision of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gods. Her hair is like copper. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist is so slim your two hands would</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass around it, and yet her hips and</seg><seg type="columnLine">breasts are full as the rising moon. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman would be worth the whole of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">wretched kingdom, Chong."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chong's eyes gleamed with interest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the midst of his flat face. He was a fancier</seg><seg type="columnLine">of women.

Listen, while I tell you the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth of this Ki-Gor: We ourselves cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured him. For us he performed in a cage</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a captive baboon. We spat on him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he cringed from terror. Then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">freed him, and he ran skulking into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle. I myself saw this mighty bow you</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell about.

You have been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">listening to the tales told by the Ivory</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunters, and they have always been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst liars in the universe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did not occur to Chong that Durga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rama himself might be lying.

When the insurrection was put</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in Ramfis, he would reorganize his</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard and slaughter the warriors who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">built huts. Afterwards he would cross the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river in force, and retake Helene for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. A white-skinned woman such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene would be worth many pounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST BEASTS OF TA'TAMBA	35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">copper in bartar with the Arab slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchants in the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene was with Nunabba, still bound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still sitting in the canoe.

It is not every woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is valued at so high a price."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene gave no sign of having heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Durga-Rama's words. She sat very</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight, looking across the vast stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT THE MOMENT she was helpless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands tied securely by the grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope. There was no point in struggling or</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleading. But she would not always be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless. Inside the breast of her leopard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin bodice was tucked a tiny dagger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dagger blade was scarcely longer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">her middle finger, and it folded cleverly</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside a golden case shaped like a scarab.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long ago Ki-Gor had found it in the val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley of tombs and given it to her. Today,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she was handed over as wife to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chong, the scarab dagger would serve its</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They waited as the morning sun became</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot. At length, five dugout canoes so load-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed with warriors their sides dipped water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in sight and crossed the broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, avoiding mudbars where swams of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crocodiles lay with backs exposed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranded driftlogs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warriors came ashore, naked save</seg><seg type="columnLine">for shields, breechclouts, and decorations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of feather, copper and cowrie shells. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were armed with assagais, crude bows, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-headed poisoned arrows. Durga- Ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ma bellowed a command, and they lined up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his inspection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">When he was through, the guard who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been at Chong's hut came up and said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Chong told me to bring the woman."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Durga-Rama nodded a trifle regretfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, the woman. Nunabba! bring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white goddess who is the wife of Chong!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The warrior stared at her white beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she walked towards them through water</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to her thighs. They did not take their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes away until the canoe carrying her was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small streak far across the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come!" barked Durga-Rama. "Let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to the fighting, and afterward I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">show you the fields where you will grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich and fat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene felt slightly sick when she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust through the low doorway to Chong's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut. Hot, putrefying odors struck her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stood near the wall, her eyes peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">through gloom. She made out a squat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy shouldered man sitting crosslegged</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a zebra skin. His forehead was low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his intelligence obviously little above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apes. He was staring at her, jaw relaxed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while he sucked his breath. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">came forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are beautiful," he said.

By Durga-Rama's</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, another group of men' were de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployed.

To</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge in on the back of Marmo, might</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead abrupt action by Durga-Rama. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">might in his rage plunge a dagger into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of Helene.

He ran ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses drawn to a fine point, while the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant lumbered in a half-gallop behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's eyes were keen along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground to pick up a warning spoor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they roved the solid jungle walls for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny leaf movements that would be his</seg><seg type="columnLine">warnings of ambush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warning came. Perhaps there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no real movement. Perhaps it was only an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct passed down from the primitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lays dormant in all civilized men, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been reborn in Ki-Gor through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">years in contact with nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped to one side. Up there the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glossy leaves trembled. Whether it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man or lurking leopard he did not know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marmo came on, slowly breaking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed.

A pit had been tunneled</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the footpath, leaving the original</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaten earth in a fragile bridge over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top. The bridge of earth was thick enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to support several men, but the elephant</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have plunged to his death on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed hardwood stakes that most cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly were driven below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marmo came to a stop at the final in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, setting his feet as the edge caved</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. He trumpeted in a high scream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rearing back to his haunches. The ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">still crumbled, but the great animal rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his side, spilling his human cargo back</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the bramble of thorns. Fora second</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lay there on the brink, then he rolled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking small trees down as he went, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus gained the assurance of solid earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor saw all this from the side of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye, for at the same moment Ngeeso shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed warning of the pitfall, an arrow whisked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by so close its bit of feathered tail brushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flesh of his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a fraction of time the ambusher was</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely visible through the leaf-tangle. Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's muscles responded like automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism. .With stunning swiftness the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong-bow came from his shoulder. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow was fitted, drawn, released. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowstring twanged with a bass sound, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an echo came the thump of metal ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowhead as it struck through the bony</seg><seg type="columnLine">framework of a human chest. A man ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered a wild, wavering scream and plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">head foremost from his place atop a limb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Another poisoned arrow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbed the earth nearby. Then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen of them, winging in a shower. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the arrows of most native archers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were woefully inaccurate. Ki-Gor did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not try to answer any but the first. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung up among the branches, bounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouching along a limb as thick as a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, and in a matter of seconds was look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down of his would-be killers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So quick and silent had been the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST BEASTS OF TA'TAMBA	39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">euver that most of them thought he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply vanished in air. He balanced with</seg><seg type="columnLine">toes holding the smooth bark, drew a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen arrows from his quiver, and in rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">succession he loosed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two of the Ta'tamba fell before their</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions realized where the hail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death was coming from. They screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in terror at the great white man poised</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, his hand loaded with winged de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction. They dropped their weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell scrambling to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were gone, and Ki-Gor expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">no further trouble from them. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention to Marmo, shouted in Swahili,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the elephant trumpted in answer. Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor gave the word which instructed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go right. He obeyed, crashing a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the undergrowth. He followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft edge of the swamp safe from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadfall, and climbed once more to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">footpath beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor swung rapidly from tree to tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the country ahead. The jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended, and he looked across a broad park</seg><seg type="columnLine">area, dotted here and there by poor yam</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields. Beyond the fields were the round-</seg><seg type="columnLine">topped huts of the Ta'tamba village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited until Marmo came near, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to his head. He crouched on</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees, urging the huge beast to greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, guiding him with the point of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marmo had not taken time to lift Brend</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ngeeso once more to his back. Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor could hear the voice of the pigmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming to him from the edge of the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait for me, Ki-Gor!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ki-Gor did not wait. Ngeeso and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brend would only be a hindrance. The am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushers had already fled across the yam</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields and were in the village, shouting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On reaching the one street of the village,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor urged the elephant to a charge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warriors were running from huts, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized their lances and their painted leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">shields. They saw the thing that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging down on them, drew up for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment's consternation, and fled for cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">like mice scurrying from a falcon. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them rose from a pit beside the path, poised</seg><seg type="columnLine">a javelin, and hurled it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The weapon flew true, sinking its point</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in Marmo's thick hide, but whether or not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beast even felt it was a question. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran without flinching, while the long shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped back and forth, hanging by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbed point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor stood, balancing himself on Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mo's pitching head. He struck himself on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chest, and lifted his strongbow high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his voice rose in a cry as it did that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night on the ridge when he killed the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">ape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifty arrows and javelins were ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be loosed, and out of such a shower it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a miracle to ride unscathed. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name seemed to take the fight momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily out of them, and in these brief sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds of respite, the jungle man guided his</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant up the footpath to the large hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">he correctly supposed was the hut of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could have charged into the hut and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left it a heap of tangled rubble, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared for Helene who might be inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped to earth, tore the skin drape</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the low doorway, and strode inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene screamed as she saw him.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tripped and fallen, and his hand was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching his chest, his fingers glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">with blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man was Chong. Helene had struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with her tiny, scarab dagger, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was built on a more massive scale than</seg><seg type="columnLine">most men, and the short blade had failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach his heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chong looked at Helene with dull eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he spun to face Ki-Gor.

She sipped once, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaffed the remainder. He slammed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chalice down and wiped his lips with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of his hairy hand, and he looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her with an added possessiveness.

He swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and out, far over the wall. With tim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing developed by years of jungle travel, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged the exact fraction of time, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laxed his hold. He seemed poised, a dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">object against the dim sky, then he plum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meted down, and his feet touched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatch-covered ridge-pole of Duga-Rama's</seg><seg type="columnLine">house as silently as the velvet paws of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leopard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ki-Gor moved stealthily along the ridge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole, shifting his weight as though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house were some delicate scale, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared tipping its balance.

Still</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripping the girl's wrist, he turned to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had disturbed the lion.

You had to adjust your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own mind to theirs while you talked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and that was the only way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be communication.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jobi,' said McDall, "you know the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huts where gods live, the trails where</seg><seg type="columnLine">gods pass. You must ask them not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">punish us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jobi shook his round head, "The fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man must not steal T'hoki juju."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The fat white man is my bondela. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot tell him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aiee," said Jobi. "I will talk to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river gods."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall turned his eyes toward Corput,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw that the big man had been watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and that he was shaking his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">sadly. The chant and the drum beat still</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the jungle. The hot, humid</seg><seg type="columnLine">night held time and the senses in suspen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion; only the brown river moved, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this so slowly that it made no noise, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of moving. McDall felt a drop of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat roll down the side of his body, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der his loose, khaki shirt. He shuddered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was angry for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning they were moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the river again--out of T'hoki coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try, on toward the Ngani stamping</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds--and McDall thought this: How</seg><seg type="columnLine">could I have been so foolish? Corput had</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorded his chant, and nothing had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, nothing at all. Of course, noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing had happened. The only thing to fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the long fear, itself, the purely imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inary thing in McDall's mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corput had eaten a hearty breakfast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was outlining his Congo lecture</seg><seg type="columnLine">52	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the portable typewriter. He had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked healthier. The blacks were poling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their shoulder-blades rippling under dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glossy skin; they were laughing and jok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing among themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jobi squatted in the b6w and mended</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas. There was nothing in his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a happy concentration on his imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diate task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And John McDall knew then that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must not delay in leaving the Congo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That this must, in truth, be his last trip;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he must not succumb to the tempta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to go upriver again. Reality, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreality were fusing much too closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">together in his mind; he was thinking na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive, and before he knew it, he would be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gin to act native.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HERE. Here was the perfect ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample. They were at the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ngani country, already. And without</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing any signs, without seeing anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the broad river and the dense jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without hearing anything but the slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slap of the water and the flurry of an oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casional reed bird, John McDall had sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly become tense and uneasy. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no reason for it. Oh, he'd have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain to clear away when he returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to civilization. And he must begin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize now that there was no juju, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">what seemed magic was only cause and</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect and no more mysterious than Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">put's clacking typewriter, or the record-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing machine-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corput, damn him, had noticed again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had seen the way McDall was think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; his typing had stopped and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding that fat, superior smile upon Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dall. "Why do you not cheer up my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend?" Corput boomed at him. "Yon</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you have much to be thankful for. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand this is your last trip. And cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly I make it an easy one, eh ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall shrugged. "You don't exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock yourself out in your quest for</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge, if that's what you mean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It amused Corput. His chuckle sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed like a small waterfall in his chest. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a sentimental fellow," he grinned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But then that makes you not much dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent from most people. Myself, I look</seg><seg type="columnLine">always at the cold logic of a thing. You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">probably think I am a faker." He clapped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands together. "You know-1 am.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And I also enjoy myself and make lots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">money while a hundred learned professors</seg><seg type="columnLine">must worry about their grocery bills. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">would like further proof? Look at you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The way you sit there-and your face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">says that you are afraid'. But you don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">know what you are afraid of-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was thinking about the Ngani, that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all," said McDall, stirring uncomfortably.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're tricky people. We probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't have any trouble with them because</seg><seg type="columnLine">we won't stay long enough, and I'm sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">you won't try to learn very much from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Just the same, they're strange, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can't tell what they'll do next. They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane by our standards." He smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. "Of course, we white men are in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sane by theirs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's difficult for you, eh?" said Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">put, holding the guide with his pale eye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"to have the natives think you are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like them. That is hard, eh? Mr. McDall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have been in this country too long."</seg><seg type="columnLine">McDall drew a deep breath and stif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fened himself against the anger that</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounded at his ear drums. He must not</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarrel with this man. His purpose was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond that. He must finish this last trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his, and then go home as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned. No emotion must interfere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND JOHN McDALL, for the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days, found it increasingly dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficult to keep from exploding against Pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trius Corput. The man had a malicious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil intelligence; he understood completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tortures of a human soul, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sympathy, none at all. He was a men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal bully. He took every opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggest that McDall was succumbing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle, to the long fear; he twisted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">every little act into evidence of it-if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">McDall would so much as frown at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">food before eating it, Corput would ask if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he were searching for evil spirits. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the way Petrius Corput amused him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self as the days and the river went by and</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall, on his cot at night, more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">once had the sudden feeling that an evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit had got into Corput and was using</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to bedevil McDall. Every time that</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LONG FEAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thought came to him, he would strain to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive it away. He would curse himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tell himself that he couldn't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">logically, like a white man, anymore . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They shored the boat, finally, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of Ngani country. The land, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, and the sky had changed gradually,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that they hadn't noticed, and didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize it until they began to wonder what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was different, and then looked about them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw. This was higher country, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything was bigger; the reeds, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creamy thunderheads every afternoon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle itself. The crocodiles that</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped abruptly from the shore into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown water were longer, the birds that</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled them were shriller and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly plumed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their own natives laughed and joked</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, and seemed not so much like chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren anymore. When Jobi talked to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice was lower than ever. He used</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the manoc words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had seen none of the Ngani, yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at night they heard the drums. Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral times they thought they saw distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires in the jungle. That the Ngani knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had come, they had no doubt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall, for the first time, broke open a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle of brandy for himself. And Corput</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared with mirth, and pointed his fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger when he caught him at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the afternoon of the fourth day, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky was clear and the sun merciless. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a great stillness, as though this part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world had been thrown suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a state of suspended animation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks lay, sleeping or just staring, along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gunwales, seeking tiny spots of shade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corput was under the canvas awning cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">recting with pencil some of his typewrit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten sheets. McDall sat nearby carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">oiling the rifles against the terrible damp</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Congo. He watched a three inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">cockroach nibble at the callouses of a sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing native's soles, and felt too stifled, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">detached to do anything about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weary, listlessly, he turned his head to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Jobi usually squatted in the bow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hunchback was still squatting, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised a little, and on the tips of his toes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though about to spring at something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His spidery arms hooked the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunwale. He had his bent, rounded fea-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tures turned toward the jungle. His head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cocked slightly . . . listening . , .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you hear?" asked McDall, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jobi's tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The query startled the little native. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked his head toward McDall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed white-ringed eyes. His mouth was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly parted and the breath went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it with a low, harsh sound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ngani," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corput looked up and grunted, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grunt say all the contemptuous words</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If Jobi says the Ngani are near," Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dall said, "you can bet that they are. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses these things. I've seen him do it</seg><seg type="columnLine">before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was no longer necessary for Corput</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say in so many words that McDall was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush crazy.. All he had to do now was</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile and lift his eyebrows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall tried to ignore it. He tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep his voice even. "Let me. warn you</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more, Corput. You may have more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you bargained for with the Ngani.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's a reason why so few white men</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ever seen them; they're entirely too</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad and unpredictable. I don't like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way it's going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The way what is going, my friend?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corput blinked with deceptive mildness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything. The-well, the feeling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air around here." McDall gestured</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely. Then he deepened his scowl arid</seg><seg type="columnLine">moistened lips which were suddenly dry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew he must sound like the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fools. He wished he hadn't tried to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain what he felt, for he knew now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Corput it would be inexplicable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corput slapped his fat knee and roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with laughter. "Ah-you are more na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive every day! The feeling in the air!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The evil spirits, eh? Admit it, McDall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is what you were trying to say, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it not? You believe in them. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall heard a noise that was like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion inside of his skull. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallest part of an instant a red curtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed in front of his eyes. The big ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery in his neck became choked with an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gry blood. "Damn you, Corput!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore. He sprang from his chair, drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping the rifle to the duck boards. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">54	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust his hands forward and saw that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers had formed themselves into claws.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kill, kill! Kill with the hands . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gasped hungrily for breath. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">choking sensation had gone away. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that he was standing there, a -</seg><seg type="columnLine">step away from Corput, trembling all over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corput was just losing the momentary</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear that had 'been in his pale, sunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are in a serious condition, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend," said Corput, frowning with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathy that McDall knew could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">real. "You had better sit down . . . re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lax. Perhaps its the heat . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a sudden commotion in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat. The boys were rising, crowding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore side, jabbering and pointing toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle. As McDall and Corput, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked in that direction they saw the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tall warriors emerge from the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There they are," said McDall. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ngani."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corput moved his bulk immediately to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of the boat. He stood there, huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looming, his pink-skinned arms folded</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his chest, and he frowned mightily</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the tall, black men who came toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. There were twelve of them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried shields and spears, and all were</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted with white and blue paint. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man at their head, the tallest, wore feath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers and bones on his head. He stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his hand, and said: "Endoko tofa</seg><seg type="columnLine">la bonyolo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here we have no chain to bind you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">translated McDall. "He means that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are welcome to his country."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CORPUT grunted. "All right. Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him thanks, or whatever one is sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to say. Tell him I wish to visit his</seg><seg type="columnLine">village. Tell him that I have gifts, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we will exchange. I must bring some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing back from this place. Do they know</seg><seg type="columnLine">about cameras? See what you can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">about my taking pictures."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall looked at Corput oddly for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, then turned to the tall native and</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered a brief phrase. The Ngani leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied just as briefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did he say?" asked Corput.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I asked him his health, and if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">many wives," McDall answered. "It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would be very impolite to get down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">business just yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fools," said Corput sadly, shaking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. "No wonder they are savages. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, Mr. McDall, you handle it your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own way. But I want to get to their vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage as soon as possible. It will be just</seg><seg type="columnLine">another stinking native village, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other white man has ever been there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that makes it good material." He added</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short, cynical laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall and the Ngani leader talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">some more. The native had narrow, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most Caucasian features and eyes with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion of Oriental slant. He spoke in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slow, quiet voice, with great dignity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with a feeling of suppressed tension.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every once in a while his eyes would</seg><seg type="columnLine">wander from side to side as if to confirm</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thought with the other men who accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall continued to translate each re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark, knowing that the Ngani expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. "His name is Wazala," he told Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">put, "and he is chief of the Ngani. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">says he knew we were coming, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spirits had also told them that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">T'hoki might make war soon. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">why they didn't greet us before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, McDall, never mind all that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let's break open the gifts and get him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take us to his village."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall looked back for just a suspend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed instant. "I wouldn't go there if I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What ?

"All</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, Corput. You're the bondela."

There was wariness</seg><seg type="columnLine">which bordered on fear in their eyes. Jobi</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the tall warriors carefully and</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered to himself in the quietest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones. McDall felt one with Jobi and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. There was evil in the air here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was the worst kind of evil because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could not be seen or heard or smelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">or touched with the fingers, it could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">be felt inside. McDall could feel it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only difference between McDall and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys was that he could keep it from show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He caught a phrase from Jobi's mutter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. "Ibwa wete joi ja nkakamwa." Death</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a strange thing. And he had all he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do to keep himself from nodding and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peating the phrase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He finally faced Corput and said, "Wa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zala will have you as his guest in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ngani village."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good," said Corput, "now you are be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sensible." He swung his bulk back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the awning, slung the camera over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and then stepped out again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd take a pistol," McDall said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You take it. I have enough to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">already."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not going," said McDall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are not going?" Corput's eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows rose for a moment, then fell again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shrugged. "Be a fool, McDall. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me make a prophecy like your witch</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctors, too, eh? Let me say that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will never leave this country. You will</seg><seg type="columnLine">rot here with the mind eaten from your</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. Rest well, while I am gone, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">McDall, and try to stay sane at least long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to get me back to Coquilhatville."</seg><seg type="columnLine">A moment later John McDall stood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun and watched Petrius Corput, sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by tall Ngani, disappear into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot, heavy darkness of the jungle. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there and looked at the spot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had disappeared. He watched for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time that it took him to fill his pipe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and tamp every last flake of tobacco care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully into place with his thumb. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally turned to go back to the awning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw that Jobi was still staring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled a little. "There is sun al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways the next dky and the next," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Jobi in native dialect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jobi didn't answer. McDall wasn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that he had heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT NIGHT McDall deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">made himself busy so that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">think as little as possible. He cleaned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns twice over, and he did the same with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corput's typewriter, and then began to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the recording equipment. The disc</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing the T'hoki chant was still on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turntable where Corput had left it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frowning at the man's slovenliness, Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dall himself brushed away the fine, ace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate shavings from the grooves. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that someone was behind him, looking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he turned and saw Jobi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Juju," said Jobi. He looked around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "In air."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall nodded. "Yes. I know." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite serious. He wasn't humoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jobi at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boat boys stirred and whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">among themselves. Something splashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">far up the river; only a croc or hippo----</seg><seg type="columnLine">but then it was well known that the evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits sometimes took the form of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures. Although there was no breeze,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limbs of the trees could be heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">slithering. A bird screeched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they heard the drums begin, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat boys suddenly stopped whisper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and all around them the jungle be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came still and listened, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Boom. Boom-boom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall knew, almost from the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">note, that it was a different rhythm this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. He turned his head slowly to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the answer in Jobi's face. Jobi was</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowning, concentrating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do the drums say?" McDall</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jobi waited for a long moment before</seg><seg type="columnLine">answering. "The fat white man brings</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him a T'hoki river god. It is fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">told that the T'hoki invade, and the fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man must die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Years ago McDall would have asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">56	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunchback how he knew; how he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly know all that just from hearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drums. He would have done that, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">else he might have laughed at him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disbelieved him completely. Now he only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded. And in Jobi's own language-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking it, not just speaking it-he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">said: "The gods use the Ngani to punish</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fat white man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is so. Death is a strange thing,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered Jobi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall's own mind seemed to be swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming. It seemed not to be his own mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a very different one that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed separately from him by the steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing jungle and then somehow magically</seg><seg type="columnLine">exchanged for the soul that he had orig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inally brought here. The feel of the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was different now. He was floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">through endless, damp time, and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but the jungle and the gods who</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed about and through it. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no tomorrows and no yesterdays. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not even words for them in the lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage in which he thought. He saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been cleaning the recording equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and of a sudden that seemed silly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. Insane. There was no reason to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work now. One did not starve. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">might work a little for jilo-meat hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger-one might vie with his friends in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting, fishing, fighting, hewing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe, but one did not exert himself oft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ener than he had to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drums were still going.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, Jobi was right. That was what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were saying. That the fat white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the T'hoki river god, and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat white man must die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There! He could understand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now h£ was one of them. Now he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Jobi, and Wazala and all the rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh, the white men would laugh and scorn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and point to 'him now, and shake their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads and say: "Too long here." But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't matter. Bendele bafa bmito. White</seg><seg type="columnLine">men weren't people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was something warm in his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked. The pipe bowl, with the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pink fire smoldering in it. A strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. A white man's pipe. He put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the corner of his mouth and drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it. Something happened. Something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">clicked within his mind, and suddenly He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't understand the drums any more--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">John McDall stood and shook as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fever. The sweat ran in sheets down</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brow and cheeks, and it wasn't a</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm, natural sweat. Almost desperately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took another long pull on his pipe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That had been close. For a moment he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone native, bush crazy-whatever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you wanted to call it. He must get out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this land. Quickly, quickly. But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a job to do first. He was still a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and there was a job that a white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">must do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Jobi," he said, "listen with care. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is something you must do for me. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you must not fail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jobi gave the standard native answer,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the formality: "Mpo-kuseya-1 can't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But he answered that he was the brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">of M'Daiw Bondela. And then he paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">strictest attention as McDall outlined what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wanted in the most careful and thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ough way. He went over it three times</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that Jobi would be sure to understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MINUTES later McDall had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat. He was trotting through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon speckled dimness of the jungle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping his steps turned toward the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the drum. It was getting louder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">McDall knew that it could not be far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. He followed the native path that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already cut through the thick growth;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow corridor with room for only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one man to pass, and he kept on it in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-darkness partly through feeling ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him and partly through long experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">in traversing the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The creepers, the leaves and grasses</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapped at him from both sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path. A vine caught the carivas belt from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which his pistol and bush knife hung. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped him short, nearly throwing him</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat on his back. He untangled it care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, then kept going. Perhaps his years</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this country had worn his mind* but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had made his body wiry and tough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they had adjusted his lungs and heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the warm, syrupy air. He could go oni</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this through the forest, always keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that steady trot----whereas most</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men might have fallen exhausted</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the first few hundred yards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LONG FEAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the drums were loud, pressing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears. He could feel the vibrations in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. He was near, dangerously near</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Ngani village. The jungle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinning somewhat; the green tangle on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side of the path was more pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etrable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left the path and pushed on through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the underbrush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached the Ngani village so abrupt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly that he almost walked out into it before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw it. He drew back quickly into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows again, he crouched and looked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All about the fire they were, the tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake-like Ngani in an undulating circle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arms linked, the paint on their faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming with the flickering light. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in a large, open space between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huts of split reeds, and just beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, under the racks of dried- meat, squat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted Wazala, chief of the Ngani.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wazala rolled his slanted eyes upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and called out a mad, screaming chant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The line of warriors barked a response.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The women, iif the line beyond that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrilled horribly. Nothing on earth can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be quite so shrill as a Congo woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Now McDall saw Petrius Corput</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched horizontally between two logs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face and belly toward the black night</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, his limbs spread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corput screamed, then sobbed. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">babbling things, but they were completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unintelligible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall shuddered. But he stayed where,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was, crouched, waiting. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing else he could do. He shifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">position every once in a while to keep his</seg><seg type="columnLine">joints from aching and his circulation</seg><seg type="columnLine">from going away. He kept his eyes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unfathomable ceremony of the Ngani</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•-the ritual of which he understood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">only one thing; that it would end in Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">put's death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An agonizingly long time went by-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">just how long, though, he didn't know. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had forgotten to check his watch at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning. He glanced at it now and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was near midnight, but that didn't mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything because he didn't remember what</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he had left the boat. His bent knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">ached after a while, and he had to sit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasping his hands on his knees. In his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, he traced carefully every move he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would make in case what he expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't happen. The moment that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ngani seemed ready to kill Corput he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to draw his gun and run for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, crouched, shooting as he came. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be perfectly useless, of course. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would kill a few of them, perhaps one with</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of the ten bullets if he were lucky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they would overwhelm him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch him between two logs, also. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the death that finally came would be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to the maddening dance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanting over his still live body . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was certain as anything could be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet he knew he must make this attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rescue Corput, no matter how hopeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might seem. He must do that because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was still a white man. And that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white man's insanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he sat there he realized that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been hearing the soft beat of other drums</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some moments. Faint, in the distance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And with them a chant. Yo. Yo. Nutufya</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ngani. Other drums . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the Ngani had heard them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of dancers had stopped swaying. Wa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zala had stopped waving the rattle in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, he had stilled his unearthly calls. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rising, prying apart his slanted eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lids and staring in wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ngani drums ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wazala stood, tall, commanding-but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a little afraid in this moment. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his arm, then swung it in a slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">semicircle toward the river. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the other chant came from. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood like that for another moment, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched his shield and spear from where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it leaned against the drying rack, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trotted off in that direction. He called,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the line of dancers followed. Someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a gurgling war chant, and the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it up, giving it rhythm and form . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clearing was suddenly empty. Wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">-it seemed empty now that the danc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing warriors were no longer there, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were still a few old men and women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving about like bewildered ghosts</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the huts. One hag had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire and was poking scattered, burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sticks back into it. Corput groaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her and she spat in his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A voice called from the opposite end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clearing-a joke apparently, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">58	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">old woman laughed as she looked in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction and replied. And then McDall</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked, too, and saw one of the'tall Ngani</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors squatting, holding spear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shield in the crooks of his arms. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously been left as a guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall allowed himself the luxury of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one deep breath. Then he broke from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealment of the undergrowth and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to run across the clearing. Surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was the thing. He was depending on</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise. The old woman at the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up, saw him, and simply stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there looking, not comprehending. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept running,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A SHARP CRY came from the hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the guard squatted. McDall</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped that it would not be heard out there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the jungle by the other Ngani. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped that they would be too far away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or perhaps too busy to hear it. He kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">running, paying no attention whatsoever</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the guard. He would handle him when,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if, some time in the next few seconds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the need to handle him became more ur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent. Right now he must get to Corput.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He passed the fire, circling slightly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidestep it. He was at the drying rack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, near the line of drums. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two logs, and taut between them Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">put's blubbery form. McDall stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corput. He saw watery eyes, no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep in the cheeks, but bulging now. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw fleshy lips tremble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't ask questions," said McDall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just follow me when I cut you loose. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ngani are out there in the jungle, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with luck we might miss -them." As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked, he drew the bush knife and slashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the rawhide bonds which held Corput's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists and ankles. The lecturer tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stagger to his feet, and fell, groaning with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old hag started screaming sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. She pointed at McDall and jabbered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">McDall saw the fallen rattle, lying where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wazala had dropped it; a worn thing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers, a gourd and an esese branch. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched it up and waved it at the woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terror crossed her face and she began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">back away toward the huts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Movement touched the corner of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye. He whirled, and saw the guard com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward him, spear raised. At first im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse his hand trembled toward the auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic pistol at his side, and then he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered that the Ngani out there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle would surely hear the sound of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot, even if they had missed the cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guard and the screaming of the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. The bush knife was already in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand, and he raised this instead. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his other hand he turned the rattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the guard, shook it once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warrior was not as frightened of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rattle as the old woman had been. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the narrow face of the Ngani, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes even more slitted than Wazala's had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. Three tiny ceremonial scars were</seg><seg type="columnLine">embossed on each of his cheeks. And as</seg><seg type="columnLine">McDall pointed the rattle, he saw those</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks work in and out, saw the wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth part slightly. No, the warrior</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't afraid of the rattle in McDall's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, but it was still an implement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">juju, a sacred and disconcerting thing;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warrier chose that moment to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spear, but he threw it hastily and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a touch of desperation. The spear passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches to one side of McDall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall leaped forward. He swung his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush-knife, saw the warrior's shield of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crocodile skin come up to parry the blow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he changed the direction of his swing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It cut deeply into the warrior's other</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. He drew it back again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chopped backhand. The blade struck just</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the man's ear . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McDall staggered back, feeling a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick. The jungle swayed around the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his vision and he shook his head vici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously to knock the nausea from it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, and trotted back to where Corput</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been. Corput was on his feet, sway-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He took his arm roughly and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him stumble across the clearing toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OMEHOW-- --in some unreal, dream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like way----he made Corput .move</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with him.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to take the chance that they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have another route, perhaps one wider</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LONG FEAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">59</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">than this.

He played that</seg><seg type="columnLine">T'hoki chant of yours on the recorder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Ngani heard it.

It seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as though someone had opened a valve and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let all of the flesh out of his cheeks. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose skin along his chin bone trembled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saliva glistened in one corner of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. He opened his eyes wide, smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolishly at McDall and then suddenly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to laugh.

All around him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the baobab trees towered, except directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the lodge, where the mountain be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan. Pearly morning light filtered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the leaves and the deep, rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">green of the loam. Over the sonorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering of the nearby river, there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chittering of monkeys, and the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scampering game being played invisibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">high up among the leaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kit exhaled with a satisfied sigh. Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the deep Gunda province, it was cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clear most of the day. The coast was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steaming country, where white men</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted and died quickly, yellow with qui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine and alcohol. Kit was a white man,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had almost forgotten it-it had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been eleven years since he had seen Kan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sas. That would seem like a foreign coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to him now. He was K'Tendi-the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">other titles the natives had given him</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't matter, it was enough to belong to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wind shifted slightly and Kit felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a delicate pulsing in his ears, as if tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms were pattering at his ear-drums. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffened. Sure enough-the jungle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">telegraph was in operation, somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by the Luberfu. A moment later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thrumming became stronger as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wassabi village picked up the message and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed it on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over Kit's head the foliage stirred, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great, flat head dipped down to regard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white dweller. Kit looked up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Manalendi," he said gravely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You hear them too, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The python shot out a forked tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">with lightning quickness; obviously the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge beast was alert to sounds no human</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear. His head wove questioningly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kit grinned. Few men see anything but</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace in a great constrictor, but to Kit</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manalendi's overwhelming curiosity was</seg><seg type="columnLine">60</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">funny. The creature had been hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the lodge for nearly a year now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">following Kit wherever he went, departing</seg><seg type="columnLine">only on brief trips to snitch a chicken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Wassabi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish you could tell me what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear," Kit said. "But you can't under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand the drum message, so we're even.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are white men coming here, Mana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lendi. And that means trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The snake did not understand that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either, but perhaps he didn't have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">told that the drums often brought trouble</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-if he were lucky, interesting trouble</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that would wind up in a fight. Manalendi</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not vicious, and most of the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures big enough to match him left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him strictly alone; it was, Kit supposed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dull life for the most part.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the python was a hole card which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kit sometimes had reason to play; no use</seg><seg type="columnLine">betraying it ahead of time.

Kit</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked speculatively at the drum which</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung, its draw-strings flaccid, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eaves of his lodge. No; if the matter were</seg><seg type="columnLine">urgent enough to arouse M'Tombu, he'd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">already be on the way-the Wassabi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tribes had heard the message before Kit</seg><seg type="columnLine">had--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought had barely entered Kit's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head when he saw the brawny body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black chieftain sprinting silently down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail toward the lodge.

Kit said, "What's it all about?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why do the boys have to be driven--</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't the baas pay enough?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The pay is high," M'Tombu returned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatting down on the turf. Kit followed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the natural grace of a man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">long forgotten the crutch of chairs. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are whispers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are always whispers.

One can sense the gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever; it shows in the eyes, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell of the sweat. Besides, who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturb K'Tendi's gold? This is another</seg><seg type="columnLine">lust. It is whispered that they seek the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valley of Dragons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kit's lips whitened. "If it were not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bearers," he said grimly, "one might</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost wish that they find it. This is very</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad, M'Tombu. How came they to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Valley?

All in all, he was not sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised. Since he had yanked Stahl and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">English girl almost out of the mouth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mokele-mbembe, he had been fearing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">such result-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For mokele-mbembe had been a dino-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saur, alive and thunderous.

Stahl had been an important bureau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crat, though a uniquely courageous one;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his word would bear weight in Belgium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Paula-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE OLD BITTER TASTE was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kit's mouth again, the alum-and-lye</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his hatred for the whole white world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a while he had thought that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">English girl would stick with him. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">she couldn't take it; her background over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode her; she yearned for the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nasal voices discussing things of no mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, longed to be back in an English</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing room where one might pat lions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and snakes on the head at a safe distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of five thousand miles. She had demand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed a poshi of M'Tombu, and had left Kit's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodge for the long haul to Berghe-Ste.-</seg><seg type="columnLine">62	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Marie and civilization.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">headmen had whips, all right, and no re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luctance to use them. A gleam of orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that fires were being lit, and camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">made for the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kit slithered forward, grasped the tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">lianas, and went hand over hand to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next tree.

He scooped up the whip. Des</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grieux scrambled to his feet, raging, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had any intention of charging Kit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight of the lash changed his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kit's eyes flicked over the guarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces of the white men.

Kit clung rigidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the python's body for a moment, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit it twice with his fist. The coils loosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him delicately, and Kit crawled free and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung away. Below, there was a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysterical shouting, and then a volley of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots through the tree they had just quit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipping the leaves like heavy rain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kit kept moving. Only when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that the camp would not be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit him from where it lay did he stop and</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch his breath. The python glided to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop near his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a melodramatic old sinner," Kit</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured. "What was the big idea, any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The snake moved uneasily; the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Kit's voice seemed to disturb it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter? Fighting some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tsss," Manalendi said. He began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slide away. Kit waited curiously until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake came back and drove a horny snout</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his shoulder blades, nearly knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him sprawling from the branch. Kit</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched at the vines and caught in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthful of air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, I'll come along. Don't be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned persuasive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tssssss!" the snake said, nudging him</seg><seg type="columnLine">urgently, and began to travel again. Kit</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambered after him as fast as he could.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The war drums boomed implacably; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very air seemed to shudder. It was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark. After a while Kit worked his way</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the top of a giant baobab to get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at the stars. Manalendi travelled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broad, impatient spiral of steel around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, shaking the branches gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're going the wrong way," Kit mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered. "And it's clouding up. Look,</seg><seg type="columnLine">handsome, damned if I'll stop to steal you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chicken at this stage of the game. You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">get me lost, and I've got business--oof!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The snake's huge head had thudded in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his ribs again. Kit decided to call a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moratorium on his plans. Pythons norm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally slept between meals-usually two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks at a time. But Manalendi had</seg><seg type="columnLine">something extraordinary on his cold little</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind tonight, that was certain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A distant flicker caught Kit's eye. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment he thought he had imagined it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then it came again. A chill went up Kit's</seg><seg type="columnLine">backbone. It was several months too early</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rainy season, but that flash could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be only one thing. An old man in L'Gon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clelu's kraal had asked certain Powers a</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor-and had gotten it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kit clambered down and began to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">south again. After a few moments the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake followed; Kit was afraid it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be disposed to interfere, but this time it</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no protest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He skirted the camp, listening wryly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sounds of frightened preparation that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drums were stirring up in it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">backtracked the safari. It seemed several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours later that he came upon the spoor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a large war party, but the stars were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now completely overcast and it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken less time. Already Kit was begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to wonder if the night would ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The party, when he reached it, was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the move. They were going south;</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, probably M'Tombu's people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Not that it made much difference-Kit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that neither side would be exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to see him now. He passed on over</seg><seg type="columnLine">them without making any sign.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dim haze of yellow and pink was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing on the far, dark horizon. Whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers moved the air above the tree-tops, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight of thousands of small, dark bodies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of them were birds; Kit was glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not see the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Valley was on fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kit pressed forward. The encampment</seg><seg type="columnLine">68	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of L'Gondelu was not hard to find; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrio'rs had lit fires. Kit descended and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked straight into it. Even a fallen king,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought wryly, has a little prestige left</seg><seg type="columnLine">-one can never tell when he might re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain his throne. Besides, Manalendi was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">following him-a spectacle to give the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">most bloodthirsty enemy a sober second</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> L'Gondelu came to meet him, tall and</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible in paint and feathers. His greet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was very simple. He said, "Go !"</seg><seg type="columnLine">three syllables in Swahilli, and three times</seg><seg type="columnLine">as unfriendly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have grave news," Kit said, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving any sign that he had heard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"M'Tombu's party is near."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> L'Gondelu gestured imperiously with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spear. A black nearly as tall as him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self stepped to his side. "Make ready,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">L'Gondelu said. "The Wassabi approach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then to Kit again, "Go. You are not wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is not the only word I bring,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kit said evenly. "It is now far too late to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make war upon the Wassabi. Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hear the jungle?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> L'Gondelu lifted his head. The jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rustling. While he listened, a small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid green snake shot through the dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his feet and vanished again, leaving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">zig-zag trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The small ones first," Kit said softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then the big constrictors, like Mana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lendi here. The birds have already gone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over; and then-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chief's eyes bulged with realization.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fire!" he said hoarsely. "K'Tendi hath</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired the jungle!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The fire is far from K'Tendi," Kit</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "It began beyond the villages of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wassabi. It is-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A medley of triumphant howls drowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out. The brush shook, and erupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">black men. L'Gondelu's warriors snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">up their spears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Wassabi!" L'Gondelu cried. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed past Kit. Arrows began to thrum</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the trees around the clearing. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north side men were already down1.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shields thudded against each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the same instant the trees were</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarming with screaming monkeys, push-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at each other, biting, jumping wildly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from branch to branch, dropping like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripe baobab-gourds that bore their name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The din was terrible, but above it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater sound came rolling in, a rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamor of terror and death. The warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated, turned from each other to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A herd of antelope stampeded through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the undergrowth, on hooves as light as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the footfalls of spirits. The glow on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky was plainly visible now. The roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">and howling became still louder, and Kit</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he could hear the faint crackling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flames themselves behind it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black men forgot their war. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees!" L'Gondelu screamed. The ranks</seg><seg type="columnLine">melted like clods in a flood, making for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thick trunks--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was already too late. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror up there among the leaves. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">black and sinuous thing looked down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from the nearest crotch, its eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing green fury. L'Gondelu stabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it, and it answered with a sound like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the death-agonies of a devil. It was mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fright and hatred, and sprang upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instant, the sabers of its claws spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Man and cat hit the ground simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously, but the cat did not stop to fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It fled, a bolt of black lightning. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossing branches more pairs of green slits</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed down. The men i§lid back down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trunks again in a hurry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "M'Tombu!" Kit shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here." The Wassabi chieftain, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most unrecognizable in his war paint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestured from the other side of the clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but made no move to come closer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he had, his own men would have put</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spear in his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Valley has been burned out!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kit said, at the top of his voice. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the din he was sure every black could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear him. "The great beasts are com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this way! They must be driven back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant the shock froze them all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sky was bright enough to cast faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows. The ground shook with the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage of heavy bodies somewhere nearby;</seg><seg type="columnLine">hippos, probably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, slowly, M'Tombu approached.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With him came two or three others, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">L'Gondelu. "Is this your doing, K'Tendi?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">SERPENT'S FETISH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">M'Tombu said somberly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No matter. This disposes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whites; the monsters will go right over</seg><seg type="columnLine">their camp; they will be lucky if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">live, and will report that the great beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been scattered beyond hope of cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. But-they must not stay scat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both chieftains nodded. It went with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out question. Penned in the Valley, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great reptiles lived out their lives with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out impinging upon the rest of the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk; but roaming abroad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have three hundred men," L'Gondelu</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> M'Tombu grinned mirthlessly.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest folk will not molest you unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">you try to halt them; let them by." Kit</seg><seg type="columnLine">moistened a finger. The fire seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving a little to the east of them, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the urging of a steady, inexplicably</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold wind. "Herd the monsters around</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the west--it will be impossible to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">them go back into the blaze."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a new thunder, agitating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees like the pebbles in a witch-doctor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattle. The night rang with the trumpet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of elephants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It began to rain. It was impossible, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the yellow-lit loam, things came</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumbering. Branches snapped with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach. The first one came through, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-foot horror with a wide-fanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, blundering like a kangaroo upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">its hind legs. For an instant Kit froze,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his muscles congealed with panic. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing moved forward, and Kit forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to shout at it. It stopped, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering, mindless eyes looked down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the puny figure with the brand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> .Brand: fire.

Piet Der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voort's people had deserted him, but evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently the young Boer was still very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive. A good man was Dervoort, Corby</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. Of a hard-riding, straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting breed.

He strode up the moonlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">path. A spurt of flame flared on the ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anda of the bungalow. A bullet fanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corby's cheek. He flung himself down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path and rolled out of the line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, swearing fluently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maryanne came racing up the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corby waved him down:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's Dervoort," said he as the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled up to him.

"I took you for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned spook! Wat dink jy--" He broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">off laughing hysterically. Then fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped into his eyes and he clamped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand over his bearded mouth while his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body shook as he stifled his mad laughter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he threw his arms about Corby</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sobbed like a woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long have you been alone, Piet?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A month, perhaps--I cannot tell.

Several of them were staring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dervoort with big, curious eyes. Corby</seg><seg type="columnLine">took Dervoort's arm and walked him to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the bungalow, lest his wild appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance and excited gestures communicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">ihis fear to the gaping Makuas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The familiar odor of palm oil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dried fish, coming from the shed, greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">TOM-TOM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Corby as he approached the bunga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. A row of empty gin bottles</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in a neat line along the rail o£</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veranda. Dervoort's rifle lay on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor; there was an open box of cartridges</seg><seg type="columnLine">near it and the brass of empty cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed on the floor. It was the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">story--a very old one for Corby, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">conventional in its details. A White</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent deserted, isolated and feeling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle closing in on him like a palpable</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass--fear fed by imagination until every</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound and object was magnified and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted. Usually the victim, afraid to sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night, kept a vigil upon his veranda,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing away at shadows. It could end in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of two ways. The poor devil went</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy and shot himself, or he got drunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stayed that way until Corby came</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sent him down river for -a rest, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remained behind to root out the trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get trade started again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Maryanne herded the Makuas</seg><seg type="columnLine">into their quarters and barred the gates</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the compound, Corby, with the toler-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance that comes of understanding, drank</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Dervoort. The truth was that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a softness under Corby's hard ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior. He took a paternal interest in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-being of the young agents that came</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his charge, if they measured'"up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he thought was desirable in a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. And it was pleasant, to drink with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man whose corpse, at this very mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment might be buried under the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth of the compound. He nodded sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathetically as Dervoort babbled incoher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently about the drum and witchcraft. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the Boer slid from his chair he</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked him up and tucked him into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bamboo cot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the following morning Dervoort</seg><seg type="columnLine">was up before Corby. He was on the ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anda when Corby came out for coffee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean and fresh-looking and apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">none the worse for the night's debauch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Senhor," said he diffidently in Portu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guese. "I think we should drag the canoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the compound. Also we should di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vide the night into two watches. You to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take one; myself, the other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh?" Corby was startled. "Why the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil should we do that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because if we do not, there will be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TRAGEDY	73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">no Makuas and no canoes in the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, Senhor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'll be damned--the drum, eh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piet? Well, don't worry about it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of experience you've just been</seg><seg type="columnLine">through can leave a man with very vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dervoort colored: "I do not imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">things," said he. "And I will bet a month's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay that you hear the drum tonight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll take your money!" Corby laughed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And just to put your mind at rest, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have Maryanne lock the boys in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters tonight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good enough!" Dervoort grinned at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him boyishly and went off to start the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later Corby sauntered through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheds. He found everything in good or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. The heat in the cargo shed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy with the sour, nutty smell of palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil, native and dried fish. He noted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction the number of tins filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orange-colored oil and the neat casks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work of Dervoort's coopers, piled high</seg><seg type="columnLine">in tiers ready for shipment. Despite deser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, Dervoort would show a better rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ord for the year than any other man along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river. He left the shed with a thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful look in his eyes. Dervoort had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of his grip on things and he wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">the type to be troubled by too vivid an</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just before sunset Dervoort and Corby</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out on the veranda. Neither of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men spoke. Dervoort stood with his gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed on a gap in the trees through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strip of the river could be seen gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like burnished tin. The opposite bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a green fringe against the sky bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liantly blue, shading into a band of purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">where distance blurred the outline of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">range of mountains. With half-closed eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corby studied the Boer's good-looking *</seg><seg type="columnLine">profile; noted the tenseness of his pose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supple grace of his young body. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">Makua was standing by the pole waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the signal to lower the flag. Maryanne</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to report all secure for the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corby jerked his thumb at the bottle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on a table at his elbow and Mary-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anne poured himself a brimmer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as he lifted the glass to his lips the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum spoke. Its tone did sound hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">74	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet each note was distinct. Thrice the</seg><seg type="columnLine">call was repeated. The booming notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered over the tree-tops and died in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limitless silence of the jungle at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precise moment of sunset. Then every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was as still as death. Not a leaf or</seg><seg type="columnLine">a twig stirred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crash of shattered glass broke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell. Liquor slopped over Corby's shoes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned to stare into the Somal's bulg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing eyes, his own face twisted into a grim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ace of astonishment. Maryanne's lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved but no words came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gungunhana's drum!" said Corby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MARYANNE burst into his native</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech; "It called thy name, mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter! Even as it did long ago when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched against him and he challenged</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to battle. Oh, we know that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Makuas say in their hearts: 'Gungunhana</seg><seg type="columnLine">will return!' It must be so, else how could</seg><seg type="columnLine">this thing be?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gungunhana is dead!" said Corby</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk like a wizard !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Maryanne knew his privilege and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was disposed to speak his mind. No good</seg><seg type="columnLine">could come of his master's fine contempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the wisdom of the forest people, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it troubled his loyal heart. How was it</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one so wise could not understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the soul of an enemy slain, might</seg><seg type="columnLine">take up its abode in the body of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, or in that of a jungle beast, the bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter to wreck its vengeance?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bwana," he began. "Drums cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak with the same voice no more than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">people can-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's true, Maryanne."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's also true that no Makua would</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare to beat the drum of a chief so power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful as Gungunhana-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha!" Dervoort, who had been watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Corby's face, interposed with the tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphant note of the vindicated. "Wat dink</seg><seg type="columnLine">jy daarvan?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What did he think of it ? Corby looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out arcoss the river whence the sound had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. What should a man think when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum, silent for ten years, boomed out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenge from the grave? According to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his emotional bias, he supposed. Just as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it was natural for Maryanne and Der-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voort, who had some Zulu blood in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">veins, to think of witchcraft, it was natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to think in terms of flesh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood, from the effect to the cause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man who is not a Makua is beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">that drum," said he.

I want--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He broke off and jumped to his feet with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an oath. The Makua who had been stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing by the flag-pole had disappeared. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">subdued babble of voices came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">native quarters, gradually increasing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume until it became a confused roar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!"

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">three were caught in the mad, screaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic and swept on toward the gates. Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by's head bobbed above the mass like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white float in a stream, while he roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and struck out to right and left.

And a preacher</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot lie!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY STARTED for the village two</seg><seg type="columnLine">■hours before sunrise and marched</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a while under the dripping of the dew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laden trees. They followed one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game trails that threaded the forest. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">river was hidden by a dense screen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush, but its noise was audible; a soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">gurgling over-tone to the throaty grunts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of beasts and the cackling of birds dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed by the passage of men. A troop</seg><seg type="columnLine">of monkeys flitted across their path like</seg><seg type="columnLine">grey shadows; the old dogs that formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear guard scolded and showed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. As the sun climbed, burning shafts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light pierced the gloom; miasma, reek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with the droppings of water beasts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose from the black mud wallows and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail ahead faded into soaking mist. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon the mist cleared. The heat became</seg><seg type="columnLine">oppressive and the three rested in a pool</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sunshine, easing their rifles and heavy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TRAGEDY	75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">packs from their shoulders while the steam</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose from their damp clothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's your explanation for the drum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piet?" Corby asked suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alamagtag, does it need one? I tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you I would feel better if we were trek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king the other way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Afraid of spooks, Piet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not the same thing. I have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen a spook, but I have seen much that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I cannot explain. Witchcraft may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickery and superstition, as you say. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have seen men' die of it. And if trick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery kills a'man, what good does it do him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's true enough. Witchcraft is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon in-.this country, and a dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. But you'll admit that the wizard kills</seg><seg type="columnLine">by poison, not by magic."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not admit it. Say now, if you are '</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed today, or tomorrow, would the Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kuas be wrong if they said: 'The drum</seg><seg type="columnLine">called him and he could not stay ?' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corby knocked the ashes from his pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rose: "We're out after the drummer</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it's our job to keep trade moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">in these parts, Piet," said he with a scowl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Besides, there's damn little else we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do until we get canoes and boys to paddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Truly!" muttered Dervoort as Mary-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anne helped him to shoulder his pack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is nothing we can do. The wizards</seg><seg type="columnLine">have turned their trick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By noon the red flare of dying banana</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronds were showing among the green,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicating the proximity of a village. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a small village of several sorry-look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing huts clustered about a palaver house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no broadening of the trail that</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached it and no man came out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">greet them, which was an insult if it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not indicative of open hostility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The devil!" swore Dervoort and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slung his rifle. "We might be lepers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are worse!" said Maryanne, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gloomily at the deserted hut. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">know a ju-ju curse is upon us. Put up</seg><seg type="columnLine">your rifle, Sar, no man will hinder us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Keep your rifle handy and keep mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing !" Corby barked at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aware that eyes were watching them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from behind the screen of bush, Corby</seg><seg type="columnLine">led the way through the center of the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">76	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lage, expecting to hear the whizz of dead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, poisoned arrows with every pace. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they reached the river unmolested. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were several canoes drawn up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddy bank; worm-eaten, battered relics</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the most part. Maryanne chose one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that looked as if it might stay afloat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Luckily the river was only about two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards across at this point, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current slow and the water as tranquil as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of a pool. To the South its channel</seg><seg type="columnLine">was visible for about a mile. To the North,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the channel was straight for several miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it was lost in a void of shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">green where it 'made its Westward turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">below Mahango.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEFORE they were half way across,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark figures began to show on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail behind, and the village drum com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced to throb. Soon it was answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by others, up and down the river, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep in the jungle. Corby swore softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his breath. Evidently his move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were being broadcast and-he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't doubt it-some Makua wizard,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with more daring and originality than his</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-hearted brethren, was building up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputation for himself at the expense of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">what Gordon Corby valued most-his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">prestige. No white man in Gazaland was</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated with more diffidence by the Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kuas than he was. That was due to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">accident of war; to the fact that the butt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his rifle had felled Gungunhana. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had come to think of it as his due,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nevertheless. It was prestige that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his work possible and his work was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though nothing of it showed on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard, lined face, Corby was thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">roused and he was worried. He knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dervoort had stated the native viewpoint</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly. If anything happened to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Makuas would say that Gungunhana's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghost had called him to account. The odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was that he was compelled to answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">the call; he couldn't ignore it. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned drum wasn't stopped, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">break him! It was just that----the cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated cleverness of the thing that wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried him. Somewhere he had an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known enemy, one whose intelligence was</seg><seg type="columnLine">above witchcraft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They found a path on the opposite bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and followed it until they could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flag-pole at Mahango on the hill above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. Corby called a halt:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's about sunset," said he. "We'll get</seg><seg type="columnLine">our direction from the drum."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dervoort nodded and Maryanne started</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fire for the evening meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again at, the exact moment of sunset,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the call reverberated over the jungle. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of himself, Corby felt the hair on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spine bristle. It was the silence that fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed it, that would get under a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin in time. But the jungle was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent for a brief moment at sunset. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if it was coincidence or a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious striving for psychological effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About ten miles North-east," observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dervoort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's where I figured it would be,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corby agreed. "It's not generally known,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there is a valley back there called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Umakosini. The Burial Place of Chiefs."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Alamagtag!" breathed Dervoort and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Corby chuckled and answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's unspoken question:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're right, Piet; they say Gungun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hana is buried there. But I'm not asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to go along. You'll stay here with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maryanne. If I'm not back by this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow, start down-river. D'you un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand, Maryanne?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes, Sar!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you, Dervoort?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Sar!" said the Boer, and spat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After he had eaten and rested, Corby</seg><seg type="columnLine">started up the trail. The soft leaf mould</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the forest cushioned his feet. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had covered a couple of hundred yards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked back. Dervoort and Maryanne</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on the trail behind him. A warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">light came into his eyes. He waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and then, without exchanging a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, the three trudged on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the path followed a shallow stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gurgled over a sandy bottom. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">night was full of whirring and cacklings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The underbrush thinned and patches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">starlit sky began to appear in the leafy</seg><seg type="columnLine">canopy overhead and, presently, an early</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon climbed above the trees and dappled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path with silver and shadow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">subdued beat of a drum sounded in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">TOM-TOM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">distance. A wooded bluff loomed ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stream led them to a deep ravine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They entered it in single file, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly and silently with the damp, live</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell of fertile loam rising from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After they covered another hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards, a hiss from Maryanne at the rear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought them to an abrupt, tense halt. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood motionless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" whispered Corby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Somal motioned him to silence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed. Corby looked back along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail. Pools of moonlight made it visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many yards until it vanished into</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy perspective. At first he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of no movement; then he saw black</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows flit across his line of vision and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flash of light on metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a trap, this kloof," said Dervoort</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly. "There will be more of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corby wiped the sweat from his face as.</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said slowly: "Well-, the fellow that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating that drum has got more on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind than killing us just yet, I think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You think he wants you alive ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got it figured that way," Corby</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dervoort did not answer for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but stood looking up the trail ahead, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">handsome face set in hard lines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shoot it out with them," said Dervoort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A Makua and a Zulu is the same thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I have seen men die slowly. Look!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke off, pointing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A STALWART MAKUA had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the shadow a few yards in:</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance of them. He was an induna, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud, stem-visaged commander of a reg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iment. A metal ring, symbolic of his rank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed around his bull neok, and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring crowned his white, woolly head. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unarmed and he extended cupped</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands in formal greeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know you, Bwana Sadari," said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corby looked into the grim face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do I look upon Sala, who was senior</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain among the Makuas?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even so. But I come in peace, Sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dari."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see that you are unarmed, Sala. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TRAGEDY	77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	saw spears behind me and, doubtless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are spears behind you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think no evil of that, Sadari.

You will know him when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him, Bwana Sadari! If you come with</seg><seg type="columnLine">many, he bade me to drive them.

Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">it be as your master says. Show us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, warrior!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The induna turned and stalked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail. As the three followed there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint rustling of leaves on either side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and Corby guessed that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">flanked by unseen warriors moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the bush parallel to their line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">march.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour's march brought them to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">right-angled turn in the ravine. A gorge</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened before them, closed in by high</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of black rock. The ground was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandy underfoot and fairly clear of bush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The gorge was manifestly the ancient bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a river, perhaps the Limpopo itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stream they had followed meandered</seg><seg type="columnLine">between huge boulders, rounded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth. The sound of drums increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">in volume.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This must be it," said Corby. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the first white men to enter the Burial</seg><seg type="columnLine">Place of Chiefs, Piet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young Boer smiled wryly: "If we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not first white men to be buried among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, I will go home and marry the predi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kant's daughter. Even that, I swear it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maryanne crowded Corby. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him while he clutched in his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the charm he wore about his neck. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligible words came from his moving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lips-muttered incantations to appease</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Great Shades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Sala halted and raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. A terrible cry rang through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorge. Corby turned in time to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Makua warriors burst from the cover of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bush behind them. He fired from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hip into the black mass. Dervoort's rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded at the same instant. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">78	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Makuas were upon them and they were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of howling, black chaos. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time they stood their ground, fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to back with clubbed rifles. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasping hands clawed them apart. Corby</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Maryanne and Dervoort go down, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he roared like a wounded beast. His heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">boot cracked the skull of a Makua that</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung to his leg. His rifle had been tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his grasp and blacks clung to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms like limpets. A jolt from his knee</seg><seg type="columnLine">freed his right arm and his big fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed into a snarling face. With his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun hand free, his automatic began to spit</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, and space opened around him. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">knob-kerry whizzed and thudded between</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders. He staggered and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at last under a mass of stinking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweating bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly the Makuas bound him, hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and foot. A slender pole was passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through loops at his feet and shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Among.yells of triumph he was lifted like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slaughtered beast and borne away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Face down and with his head bobbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot above the ground, the dust that rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from under the splay feet of his bearers</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked him. By the time they had cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered a mile he was conscious only of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony in his muscles which were drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">with every swing and jolt as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being racked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dust had blinded him, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzied clamor of drums, savage yells,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bedlam that came suddenly to swirl</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him, told him that they had ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived at a village. The swaying stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His head struck the ground and the stench</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mould and dung filled his nostrils. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited until there was silence near him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then rolled over on his back. Great tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamed down his lined face as he opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes and some of the grit was washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stifled Boer oath and a groan sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed close to him. Dervoort, Maryanne?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He called the Somal by name. Dervoort</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered him in a choked voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They left him back there-dead!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corby began a mad struggle with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds about his arms and legs. The hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">was filled with his gasps and groans until,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed in sweat, he lay exhausted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank into a kind of coma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SOUND of men talking outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hut awakened him. Pencils of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight pierced the noisesome blackness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rattan door of the hut was open. Light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and air streamed and was blotted out again</seg><seg type="columnLine">as two Makuas crawled in. One bent over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corby, the other over Dervoort, steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing in their hands. The bonds about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corby's legs were slashed. Cramped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to stand, they were dragged out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sunlight, where they were allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kick until the life came back into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs. A dozen Makuas stood in a circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">around them, leaning on their spears, jab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bering and laughing. Corby saw a few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own boys among them and got some</seg><seg type="columnLine">consolation from their glum looks. They,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least, were not enjoying their Bwana's</seg><seg type="columnLine">humiliation. Then the two whites were</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaved up onto their feet and marched</seg><seg type="columnLine">along a path between two rows of huts</seg><seg type="columnLine">that looked fresh and new.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the far end of the path there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow, raised on a foundation of piled</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones. Its extended eaves, supported by</seg><seg type="columnLine">four poles, shaded a wide stoop. A heap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dried mud, bundles of raffia and sap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lings recently slashed, attested the new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the structure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they approached it, two figures came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on the veranda. One wore a white tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ban with a fringed knot over his left ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his obesity was made prominent by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his loose, white robe and the green cum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merbund around his belly. The other was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman, tall and full-breasted. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance of twenty paces, she looked like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white woman, but as they came to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the foot of the veranda steps, Corby</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Arab blood in the olive sheen of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin bared by her white sleeveless abaiyia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in her black, flashing eyes. A golden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired marmoset, at the end of a length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver chain attached to her wrist, sat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her naked shoulder with his prehensile tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiled around her neck. The grotesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">little creature grimaced at them and bared</seg><seg type="columnLine">its teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alamagtag!" whispered Dervoort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She is something to look at."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Corby's eyes were fixed on the fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arab's face. It was a flabby black-and-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white mottled face with sagging jowls like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dewlaps of a hound. A close-cropped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">TOM-TOM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grey beard only half concealed full lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a mouth of discolored teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see that you have not forgotten me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bwana Sadari," said the Arab in a high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibilant voice. "I have prayed that we two</seg><seg type="columnLine">should meet again. Behold, my prayer is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">answered-it is the will of Allah!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I have not forgotten you, Saf Me-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jid-it were easier to forget the devil!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Corby retorted. 'And truly, the will of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allah is beyond all understanding or sure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly he would have answered the prayers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">better men and sent you to hell long since,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tc await me there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mejid's belly shook with silent mirth:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Doubtless all will be answered," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We shall meet there again in the end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now it is a matter of precedence.

I have so arranged'it-in sha</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Allah!" Then his yellow-flecked eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed with venom. He jerked his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the girl: "This is Nanan. Her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mother was French-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corby turned curious eyes upon the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stood looking at Dervoort with a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile on her full lips as if pleased by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frank admiration she saw in the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boer's eyes. Corby had heard of Mejid's</seg><seg type="columnLine">French wife. Some said he had stolen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her, others- Mejid's voice recalled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-She was my great happiness un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til you came to Gungunhana's kraal with</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers and drove us forth into the wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derness.

"You</seg><seg type="columnLine">preached war and when it came you ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a coward and left brave men to pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your folly with their lives."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mejid's hand flew to the hilt of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kumia thrust into his sash: "No more</seg><seg type="columnLine">words!" he shouted. "I did not call you</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to palaver! No, you have come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment and to death, as I knew you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would when I called you on the drum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because you are as vain of glory as other</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Yes, you will die, but not quickly!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pointed to a large hut that stood at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the clearing: "There is your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TRAGEDY	79</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">prison.

Occasion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally his gaze turned toward the hut at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the clearing before the heavy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred door by which two armed men</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood guard, and as often as he did so, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh, yes, it was a pleasant thing and,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by Allah, it was a shrewd thing-to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">avenge himself and to establish his au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thority over the Makuas, at one stroke!</seg><seg type="columnLine">With what patience and cunning he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned it!

Sala was offering him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a way out, but it was not in his nature to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept it. Compromise and prestige didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mix.

A shocked cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst from the Makuas. Sala snarled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded back for a few paces like a boxer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His spear flashed upwards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corby stood his ground, his rifle still</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting in the crook of his arm A look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of consternation came to Sala's face It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to Corby that his eyes were fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a point beyond him, but he dared not</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn his head. Slowly the spear was low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered. Corby took a pace forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the spear from Sala's hand. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">offering up a silent prayer of thanksgiving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned to look around the circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black faces until his eyes came to rest on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own boys who sat in a group apart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">One by one they stood up as his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">singled them out.

So he led that</seg><seg type="columnLine">party of strange scientists through twisted, unknown jungle trails--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he knew the prize they sought was his own dead body!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SLEIGHS' SAFARI WAS</seg><seg type="columnLine">camped on the river about a mile be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low Massa Kessi, or Macequece as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Portuguese called the little African</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. The rest house, a thatched bungalow</seg><seg type="columnLine">perched on iron-wood stilts, stood in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">centre of the clearing overlooking the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now silvered by the light of an early moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The flat space behind the bungalow was oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied by several small tents and a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">square, khaki-colored mess-tent before</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Sleigh's Swahili porters sat croon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the accompaniment of a bamboo</seg><seg type="columnLine">flute, more pitiful than the wailing of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned infant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Emerging from the shadows of the jun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle trail, Ross Bain paused to take in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene. Sleigh looked like money, he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded. And a white-hunter who owed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">headman a couple of months' wages had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no right to be fastidious in the choice of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clients. It was just the fact that Chemly</seg><seg type="columnLine">had recommended him to Sleigh that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him hesitate. He couldn't understand why</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chemly had done it. There was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer about it. A knife slipped between</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ribs in a dark alley was the more likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for him to expect from Chemly. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">here was Sleigh--a naturalist, wanting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work the Revue River as far south as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bometela's kraal and then north to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rhodesian border. Not just another big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">game hunter out for trophies and glory;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was an event, or his sister was. Noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like her could happen again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross smiled quizzically as he strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the bungalow. The devil take</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chemly! A man had to make the best of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his opportunities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cane chair creaked as he mounted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda steps and a white-clad figure rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shadow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, glad to see you, Bain!" Sleigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook hands with him affably. "Just in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for drinks." He was a tall man with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and uncommonly large head, a ruff of gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hair and pale, blue eyes. One side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face was paralyzed so that when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled the corner of his mouth slid up</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward his left ear. Ross found it hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reconcile his boney ugliness with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapely, provocative loveliness of his sis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. It was one of those jokes of nature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he supposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Sleigh, dryly, "I hope this</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit means that my sister has convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Bain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross flushed in the darkness.

"Bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bounder isn't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross smiled wryly--typical British un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstatement that!

He said you didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have enough brains to be dishonest, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you knew this country as well as he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inside of a bawdy house. Coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Chemly I thought that was high</seg><seg type="columnLine">praise and looked you up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross laughed. "That's dear old Chemly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right! Well, I'll admit to knowing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country.

She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blonde, tall and very shapely in her jodh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">purs and white silk sweater. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her an exuberance, an emanation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical nature in hardy flower. Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned back against the veranda rail, silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, savoring the strong flavor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's good country," he said, presently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not much fever, too high for it.

"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you chaps prefer your own men, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to take my Swahilis along. They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">all expert skinners. That's important, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">careless skinner can ruin a good specimen."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This isn't a big-game hunt, so that's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right," Ross agreed. "I'll want to take my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own headman, M'bani, that's all. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't worry about the Makuas. They've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a bad name, but it's just a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp discipline, understanding their lingo</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tabus. That's what you're paying me</seg><seg type="columnLine">for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!

Sleigh held out his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," murmured Ross with a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown. He fished the booklet out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast pocket of his shirt. It served the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dual purpose of passport and discharge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">book. On the fly leaf there was a photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph and a physical description of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">holder. The remaining pages gave a rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ord of previous engagements with a signed</seg><seg type="columnLine">reference from each client.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleigh thumbed through the pages</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, but examined the fly-leaf care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. "He's not married, Jennifer," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">commented with his crooked smile and</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed the bqok to the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hm-m-m!" she mused over it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thirty-five, six feet, curly haired pan'</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything--Lord, you'd better start run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, Mr. Bain!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any reason why we shouldn't start</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning, Bain?"

"But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are two cases of scientific equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, plainly marked. Be careful with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them." He smiled tolerantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Won't touch 'em!" Ross grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at him. "I'm not a customs officer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	just want to see that we've got what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed for the trip."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The smile faded slowly from Sleigh's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face as Ross went down the steps.

"Don't tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that you're getting nervous, brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear," she said, with a tinge of malice in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. Sleigh scowled at her and stamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the bungalow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross walked across the clearing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Swahilis, guiet now, sat around a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. Sleigh's headman rose and detached</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself from the group as Ross shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">LOST SAFARI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">8 7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his name. He wore a brocaded vest which</seg><seg type="columnLine">left his muscular arms and deep, broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest bare. A scarlet cummerbund belted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his white duck pants and the lobe of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left ear was missing. It looked as if it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been sliced off by a sabre cut, for there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a pink scar running down from it across</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cheek to the corner of his mouth. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked with a swagger, his hand resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the hilt of a knife in an ornate scabbard</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust into his cummerbund. Ross didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">like his bold eyes and guessed that he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen service in one of the native regiments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably as a sergeant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Muttering under his breath and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowl on his hard face, Amuku followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross with a lantern, checking over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loads. They came to a couple of cases, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">on top of the other, marked with a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Open them," said Ross over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Much trouble!" growled Amuku,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross turned on his heel to face the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headman, his eyes measuring him. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to be paid off?" he asked, evenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You no fit for drive me!" retorted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headman. "Me b'long Bwana Sleigh big</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROSS' EYES FLASHED and he rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped out a dozen, stinging words in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swahili. Amuku stiffened and stood like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ebony statue, but he was working up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nerve. His brash eyes rolled and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips moved though no audible sound came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them. In a sudden fit of temper</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned and yanked at the upper-most</seg><seg type="columnLine">case. It came down on Ross' toe and he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">let out a yelp of pain. Amuku spat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned. Then Ross hit him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blow knocked the headman off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. But he was up again in an instant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ross felt the .muscles in his belly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tighten as he saw his curved knife flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its scabbard. He met Amuku's</seg><seg type="columnLine">leopard-like charge with his shoulder, rid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it and twisting his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blade clinked on the buckle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his belt, sliced through leather and flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he had Amuku's arm over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. With a grunt of exertion he</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted around and flipped the big black</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. Amuku flopped across the case with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sickening thud and the sound of splinter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wood. With the wind knocked out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he rolled off the case with his knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn up to his chin. Ross kicked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife from his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fight was out of Amuku when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to his feet.

Ross felt the hair rise from his scalp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His mouth was still open to shout, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had uttered no sound. He saw the leopard</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump sideways, snapping at its hindquar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters; then crouch snarling, tawny, wicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes glaring at the girl who stood utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless, fascinated by fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had all happened in a split second, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross fired from the hip before that second</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out, hoping to check the beast's charge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He heard the impact of his bullet. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a yell he shouldered the girl and sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sprawling as the feopard sprang. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired again blindly as the white underbelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">came hurtling toward him.

But he knew that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hold on long, could not save himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the slashing, razor claws. Blood from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wound in the beast's throat trickled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rigid forearms, and he knew his last</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot had hit and hung on for his life, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leopard's struggles became feebler. Fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally it rolled over and lay on its side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles twitching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROSS got slowly to his feet and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to curse as his nerves reacted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shock of it.

"You seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have forgotten the importance of time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jennifer," he said carefully. "Among other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things." he added, significantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl's lips tightened. Watching her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross thought he saw the shape of fear be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind her silence.

She gave him an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enigmatical smile and turned away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside in the night he paused to think.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something queer in all this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were in a naturalist's paradise, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, they'd been treking through one for</seg><seg type="columnLine">three days now. But for all the attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleigh paid to it they might just as well be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Sahara Desert. There didn't seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be much of the scientist's enthusiasm</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. On the trial he plodded along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">morose and silent, oblivious to his sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings, except to curse the mosquitoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and complain of delays. But he had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation for it. He liked his comfort;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wanted a base camp. Let him have it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross shrugged and trudged off to his tent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They turned westward working their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way up stream toward the Rhodesian bord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er.

Presently they came upon a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stripped palms, one on each side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, with offerings to the local fetish</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging from them. And there was a log,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half buried athwart the trail, a charm to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the leopards away from the village. • •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VILLAGE itself was crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a cleared plateau overlooking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river--a collection of frail huts with</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatched roofs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Bometela and his people came out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet them.

There was a rest house, Bome-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tela told them, but the roof had fallen in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He graciously offered them his palaver</seg><seg type="columnLine">house as a shelter--an offer that Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily countered with a gift and a request</seg><seg type="columnLine">for permission to make camp a mile up</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream from" the village where they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be assured of un-polluted water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you want me to hire a few hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers?"

He was inclined to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that M'bani was expressing his deep-seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">distrust of all who were not Makua in</seg><seg type="columnLine">origin. Certainly, Sleigh's crew knew their</seg><seg type="columnLine">job and they seemed to be willing enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later he picked up his rifle and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the mess tent. He found Sleigh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jennifer sprawled out in camp chairs be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind billowing mosquito-netting. Jennifer</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened one eye as he entered and said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have a drink, Ross."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleigh only grunted, and Ross said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's a spot up stream I'd like you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a look at, Mr. Sleigh.

Sleigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaved himself up stiffly, yawned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed on his helmet. "Come on, Jen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nifer. There's no rest in the man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross led them down a narrow trail that</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed under a continuous, archway of</seg><seg type="columnLine">boughs so thick that the sunlight only</seg><seg type="columnLine">filtered through it and dappled the leafy</seg><seg type="columnLine">loam or sparkled on the noisy river. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">along was the spoor of the game that used</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail; the diamond-shaped hoof prints</seg><seg type="columnLine">of antelope, hippo slides in the clay banks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river and trees deeply scored, four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen feet above the ground, where elephants</seg><seg type="columnLine">had paused to sharpen their tusks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Further on the river narrowed to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorge. The lap and wash of the rapid had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn the stone bed into great, dark folds</seg><seg type="columnLine">which in places enclosed patches of golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand and pebbles. On the opposite bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground sloped down and trees arched</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a green pool fed by miniature falls</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a lacy, rainbow mist rising from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges. Cream balls and water lilies shone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with pearl-like lustre amid the green and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongly scented the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross halted motioning his companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">to silence. After a few minutes life came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the pool. A monitor, invisible be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, slid from a fallen tree and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flash of turquoise light as a kingfisher</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooped down on a swarm of insects.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross pointed as the surface of the pool was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruffled. A great snake swam across it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bird, just caught, held in its jaws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a box seat," he whispered. "You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">see all there is to see here, and the light is</seg><seg type="columnLine">good for photography."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Sleigh was not listening. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even watching. He sat on a log with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back turned to the pool, wiping sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his forehead. His face was flushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Feeling rough?" Ross asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Sleigh answered wearily. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of fever, I think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better get back to camp then." Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">started back down the trail. They had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone far when the girl stopped, pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">upwards. "Look, monkeys!" she exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WHOLE TROOP crossed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of them, leaping the narrow gap</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the path high overhead like fleeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">grey shadows, and making a good deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of noise while they were about it. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, a young fellow, misjudged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance and fell. He lay on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly hurt and whimpering like a child.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A shot from Ross' rifle put him out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">misery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's not often you see one fall," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">commented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleigh stood looking down at the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature with a puzzled expression. "Too</seg><seg type="columnLine">young to hold on with its tail, I suppose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross' eyes opened wide with astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. He stood utterly still, staring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleigh. His mind slow to accept implica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the other's words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's wrong," demanded Sleigh, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around nervously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you know?" asked Ross quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn it, no! said Sleigh, irritably.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Should I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think so," Rbss said, with a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleigh's glance shuttled to the girl. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged and his eyes came back to Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">92	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">again. His face showed signs of internal</seg><seg type="columnLine">distress. Then he muttered something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a headache, turned on his heel quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, and strode off down the trail. Jennifer</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross stood watching them with a broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin on his face. He wasn't a naturalist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he knew that African monkeys did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing by their tails. Only the New World</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkeys, the Cebidae, had prehensible tails.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleigh might have passed it off as a joke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had not. He knew he'd made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faux pas, but he didn't even know where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd gone wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naturalists, my foot!" murmured Ross.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the grin faded from his face. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he wasn't a naturalist, what was he?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why this masquerade in the jungle? It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not his nature to nurse a grievance</seg><seg type="columnLine">or suspicion, and he didn't like being led by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nose into anything. He headed back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp determined to have it out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleigh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Sleigh had another idea. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross got back to camp he was stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on his cot groaning, and the odd part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it was the real symptoms of fever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross suspected that it was the mild kind--</seg><seg type="columnLine">recurrent shakes and temperatures. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleigh was making the most of it. He ram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled incoherently when spoken to, sweated</seg><seg type="columnLine">and groaned. To be on the' safe side Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">got him under blanket, then measured out</seg><seg type="columnLine">doses of quinine and left him with the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jennifer did not show up for the evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal and Ross ate alone in the mess tent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later he sat smoking, thinking back, won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering. Snatches of conversation, meager</seg><seg type="columnLine">details passed through his mind and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out woven into a pattern. Carefully he</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered it. There was Sleigh's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection with Chemly--not necessarily what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said it was. The fact that he'd come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his own gang. Jennifer Sleigh--there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something wrong about the brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sister relationship, he felt it. Sleigh's</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifference; the monkey incident, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. Yes, it all pointed to those two cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scientific equipment that Sleigh didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want disturbed. The answer was in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose knocking the ashes from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe. The cases stood in a corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent under several others. He dragged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them out. It took him some time to pry</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the locks. Eagerly he unpacked them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then stood amid the litter of their contents,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swearing softly with a look of bewilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment on his face. There were books, neat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly labled bottles, chloroform, specimens in</seg><seg type="columnLine">alcohol--an entomologists field equipment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now you can put them all back again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross turned slowly to face Jennifer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleigh. Her blonde head was thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the opening of the tent and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was looking at him with derision in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Ross stared at her blankly, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face grew red with anger and guilt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did you expect to find" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, mildly curious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anything but this!" Ross anwered</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh--why ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why? Well, damn it, because African</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkeys don't swing by their tails!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see." Suppressed laughter quirked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corners of her mouth. "Robert's only</seg><seg type="columnLine">an amateur," she hastened to explain--</seg><seg type="columnLine">too glibly, Ross thought. "And he's really</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in bugs. He should have told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross' smile was slow. He said, "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. He mentioned skinners, and I've never</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of a man skinning a bug."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, well." She shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why are you afraid of him?" he asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to catch her off balance. It didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's got a violent temper. He can make</seg><seg type="columnLine">things damned unpleasant," she answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">blandly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross gave her a long, steady look, then i</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right, Miss Sleigh. I guess I stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chin out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled. "Don't lose any sleep over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, Ross. No harm's been done. I'll help</seg><seg type="columnLine">you pack that stuff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time they had finished the camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">had settled down for the night. Sleigh's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent was the only one showing a light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drums were throbbing over at the Makua</seg><seg type="columnLine">village and the bull-frogs were singing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their blatant serenades down among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds. Ross put out the lights and held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flap of the tent up for the girl to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. She ducked under his arm and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">up very close to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ross--" she started to tell him some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">LOST SAFARI	93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, but broke off, the signs o£ inward</seg><seg type="columnLine">strife plainly showing on her face. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross was conscious only of her perfume,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the out-thrust of her breasts, warm through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shirt. Her shoulder touched his arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding up the flap. The moment was ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistible. His arm slid down about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist. She yielded, her body arching to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his. He kissed her and her lips clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his for a breathless moment. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed him off with an oath that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears burn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't get any ideas about me, Ross !"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said, breathing quickly. "Just forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should I?" demanded Ross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll find out!" she looked up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face, briefly, appealingly. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran for her tent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROSS looked up at the stars, "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned right I will!" he muttered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That brother of yours is after something,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it isn't bugs, my girl!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a moment of deliberation he start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to cross the clearing for his own tent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he was passing the cook tent he hauled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to listen. Someone was scuffling around</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside. One of the boys stealing grub Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come out of there!" he shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was absolute quiet for a moment;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a stiffled scream and a figure burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the tent and came flying towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a rush of air and the jingle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bwana! Bwana!" A Makua girl, stark</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked but for the beads and bangles around</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wrists and ankles, flung herself at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Amuku came out after her. He pul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">led up short as he caught sight of Ross,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then advanced slowly, his chin thrust out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brash eyes glinting in the moonlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl clung to Ross' legs whimpering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gently he lifted her to her feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She mine! You make no trouble,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled Amuku.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you take money from this man?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross asked the girl in the Makua dialect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sound of her own tongue heartened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl. From behind the shield of Ross'</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad shoulders she hissed and spat at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amuku like a kitten at a tomcat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No" she said,, scornfully, "He caught</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me by the pool where we bathe at night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go back to the village," Ross told her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And say to Bometela that I will come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">palavar about this thing tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the girl turned and raced away Amu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ku made after her. Ross stepped into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">path and landed a blow that lifted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black off his feet and set him down on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I said no man was to go to the village,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Ross, coldly. "I am going to drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Amuku."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big Swahili went for his knife, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross was too quick for him this time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted in and kicked it from the black's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand as it flashed from the scabbard. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stepped in slugging. But Amuku faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">backwards, riding his punches. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rushed and his arms caught Ross in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushing embrace. Ross gasped as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure tightened about his ribs, and knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was in serious trouble. He feltx a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush of fear as his feet left the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amuku threw him hard, and he hit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground with a thud that rattled every bone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his body. He lashed out desperately as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amuku dived for him. The headman turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed a somersault and flopped on his back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross was on his feet in an instant. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he could jump back Amuku had</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by the ankles and his feet were jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">from under him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They rolled over and over, grunting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">exertion. Amuku clawing at Ross' face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to gouge his eyes. Ross was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more powerful man and he had a cooler</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, but Amuku had oiled himself recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was some time before Ross could</seg><seg type="columnLine">fasten a good grip onto him. At last he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got Amuku's arm up behind his back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amuku began to howl for help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross heard Jennifer's scream mingle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with shouts and the pad of bare, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. In a moment the other Swahilis were</seg><seg type="columnLine">milling about, jabbering like a cage full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkeys. Hands clawed at him. His shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ripped from his back. He released</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amuku and sprang to his feet, lashing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and left with fists and feet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swahilis fell back under the barrage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows that left two of thepi stretched out</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold. Ross got a fleeting picture of Sleigh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad in gaudy, stripped pajamas, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the opening of his tent. Jennifer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">94	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him, her eyes big with fear. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Swahilis were closing in on him, sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently, warily. Then a gun exploded and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet whined overhead. On top of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came M'bani's wild war cry. He came</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging, wild-eyed and swinging Ross'</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun-belt around his head. The Swahilis in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his path scattered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good boy!" Ross gasped in relief. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the heavy automatic from M'bani's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. Under the menace of it Amuku and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Swahilis froze. Ross looked them over</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cold eyes. Said he: "Amuku did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">obey M'bani. He stole Makua girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A low murmur of dismay went up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Swahilis. Curses and angry looks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown at Amuku. The big headman seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to shrink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What will the Makuas do about this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing?" Ross asked. Then as the Swahilis</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to jabber in panic, and some to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slink away, he laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No good to run away!" his clear voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang out. "Makua drums will talk tonight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are dead men, if I do not speak for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you!" Then they were crowding around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, pleading, begging. He silenced them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Amuku will give his wages as a peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">offering to Chief Bometela, and I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">palavar with him. Now, let each man put</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knife at M'bani's feet. I have spoken!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was done without a murmur of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">test. Ross holstered, his automatic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode over to the Sleighs, his eyes trucu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent. Jennifer ducked into the tent as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're heading back to Macequece,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Sleigh," he announced. "Just as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you're fit to travel." In the thin silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that followed he watched anger come alight</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Sleigh's black eyes, saw it twist his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face into an ugly grimace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn it!" Sleigh exploded. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit high-handed, Bain. I'll tell you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">when-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm telling you!" Ross cut him short.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've had more trouble with you in six</seg><seg type="columnLine">days than I've had in as many years! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know what your game is. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">care. My job is to get you back to Mace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quece, safe. From the look of things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's not going to be too damned easy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So shut up and pack up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH THAT off his chest Ross felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">better and stamped off to his tent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he didn't sleep. The Swahilis were</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding a palaver in the cook tent. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the hum of their voices above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stridence of the jungle night. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know what to expect. He pinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the flap of his tent so that he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good view of the clearing, put out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp and sat in the darkness with his rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his knees. He dozed off with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumble of drums in his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened his eyes with a start. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon was still high, and the .first thing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw was Sleigh, in his gaudy pajamas, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose slippers making a flapping sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he picked his way carefully across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing. Ross' first thought was that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sleep-walking. He half rose then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank back as he saw Sleigh was headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the cook tent. After pausing to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Sleigh dived into the tent and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmur of voices ceased. Minutes passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he came out with Amuku. The big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swahili had a pack on his back and car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried a rifle. The pair stood talking for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while in hushed voices, then Amuku left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp. But he did not take the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the Maceguece, he was headed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream toward the Rhodesian border.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Utterly motionless and completely be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered Ross watched Sleigh return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own tent. Presently the other Swa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilis came out and drifted like shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the clearing to their quarters. Sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled on the camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross shook his head, while a profound</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of depression and foreboding took</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of him. It was all very strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was an ugly bewilderment about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was behind it? What could Sleigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">be after, here in the jungle a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from anywhere ? He could think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nothing. He turned in swearing softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his breath, consigning Sleigh and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his works to hell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jennifer showed up for breakfast the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next morning. While M'bnai served</seg><seg type="columnLine">them they talked casually, but as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had cleaned up and left the tent Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">said: "Your brother's fever seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">much better last night, Miss Sleigh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She fumbled in her shirt pocket for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigarette. Ross struck a match for her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">LOST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He's not my brother," she said, as she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leaned toward the match.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ross stared at her. It was the confes-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sion not the fact that startled him. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">held the match until it burned his fingers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then dropped it with an oath and caught</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her wrist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord--your husband?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" she laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe he'd like to be?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" She snatched her hand away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jumped to her feet. "I'm just sick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies!" she cried. "You get out of here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross, fast! Don't let him talk you out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind. Just pack and head for</seg><seg type="columnLine">home!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ross leaned back in his chair, grinning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up at her. Said he: "You know I don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">think there's as much brass in you as you'd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like me to think. Maybe I should stick</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're crazy if you do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're in some kind of trouble. Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me more. I'd like to help."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you try and big brother me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she flared. "Just get out of here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross smiled slowly. "Was there any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing brotherly in that kiss last night?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She gave him a startled look, opened her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mouth to speak but shut it again as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sleigh's shadow fell across the tent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you two shouting about?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he demanded as he came in, his eyes dart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing suspiciously from one to the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll get a chill walking around in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those pajamas," Ross said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleigh looked at him blankly, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Jennifer. "I'd like to eat," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said plaintively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll get M'bani." Jennifer gave Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">a meaning look and went out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sleigh sank into a chair with a groan:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Don't let what happened last night up-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">set you, Bain. I need you. I was wrong</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in bringing Amuku along. He's a trouble</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">maker. I sent him packing last night in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the hope that you'd reconsider."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross was conscious of a feeling of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">asperation. Sleigh was too fast for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He always beat him to the punch with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation that, on the surface, at least,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SAFARI	95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had the color of truth. He asked: "Why</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">did he go west?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh, the Makuas, he didn't want to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pass near the village." He smiled crook-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">edly, and went on: "I paid him his wages</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in full. I knew you'd object, so I did it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when you weren't around. Thought it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was the best way to avoid trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ross smiled wryly. There it was again!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">All the loose ends tied--too damned neat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ly, It occurred to him that he might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">make better progress if he kept his mouth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shut. He said: "I'm on my way over to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Makua village about that girl. They'll</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ask for plenty. It may take a day or two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to get it settled." He watched Sleigh's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worried expression change into one of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quiet satisfaction. He thought: He likes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the delay, he's playing for time. Some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing is going to happen&gt; soon. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sleigh's next words seemed to confirm his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Anything you say, Bain," he approved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The cash is here when you want it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">AS USUAL the palaver was a long-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drawn out affair. All the members</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the girl's family made a speech. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it developed that half her bride-price had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">already been paid by a fine young warrior</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and his claim was vociferously pressed by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">three generations of his kin. Ross was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glad to settle for twice the girl's full bride-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">price before he ran into further compli-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cations. He left, promising to return with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the equivalent in cash on the following</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was midnight before he got back to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">camp. Utterly worn out with talk and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feeling the kick of the palm wine he'd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drunk, he stripped to the waist, flopped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on his cot and was soon asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The sun was high when he awoke. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had a bad taste in his mouth and wanted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coffee. He shouted for M'bani. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was no answer. He shouted again. Still</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no answer, and cursing he started to dress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His shirt felt light in his hand. He felt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the pockets. His passport and license</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were missing. A quick, startled glance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around the tent revealed that his rifle and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">automatic were also missing. His jaw set</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes hardened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then Ross steamed off to the mess tent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">96	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">When he entered, sheer astonishment jolted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rage out of him. Sleigh was seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the table and beside him stood another</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man--a tall fellow with dark curl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hair, wearing a belted, tattered cordu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roy jacket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross' eyes measured him then fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto his face. There was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar about the fellow. He'd seen him</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, somewhere,, years ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger was looking him up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down now, rubbing the beard stubble on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chin with his hand, making a rasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound against the jungle silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a striking resemblance," he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked in a soft, cultured voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross' mouth opened, and he stared fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishly, his mind slow to accept what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard. But there it was, considering him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cold, grey eyes--his own image! No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not his image, exactly. The face was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little different. It was longer, the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">more closely set. But in build and color-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the two men were alike as two peas</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a pod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Chemly had it figured out all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right," said (Sleigh. "With his license</seg><seg type="columnLine">you could get by an army, Eddy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My license--say what is this?" Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleigh chuckled and his mouth slid up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like you to meet an old colleague of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine, Bain--the rare specimen we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look for. You've heard of him, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. Eddy Talman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Talman, the I. D. B. man! Ross whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled softly, he was beginning to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand. Eddy Talman was the smartest</seg><seg type="columnLine">illicit diamond buyer in Africa. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">months ago he'd made a big haul, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot a Jo'burg policeman and escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I gather that you have heard of me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Talman. "And you have the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune to look very like me, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does that mean?" Ross asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'd guessed the answer, but he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps this will save time," Talman</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a passport book from his pocket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed it to him. Ross looked at the fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaf. The physical description tallied</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with his own. All that was needed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to change the photographs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It's a change of identity I contemplate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bain," Talman said cooly. "A temporary</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," said Ross, dryly. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody might get to wondering what</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to me back at Macequece."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why should they? You haven't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the coast in ten years. Well, you went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on safari with Sleigh. You work your</seg><seg type="columnLine">way down to Joboto on the coast. Sleigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">decides to work new territory. He in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vites you to go along. He books a steamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage for you. You go, or rather I do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">D'you think the Portuguese johnnies will</seg><seg type="columnLine">• catch on to that ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross saw only too clearly that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not. What he couldn't see was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">permanent spot for Ross Bain in the shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">of future events.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It's where I go that interests me, Tal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You lose yourself in the jungle for</seg><seg type="columnLine">three months, and you take five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds sterling to make it worth your</seg><seg type="columnLine">while. Of course, Amuku and his boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">will go along with you, just to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you keep to your end of the bargain. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, if you're smart, you'll get yourself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new license and keep your mouth shut."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You make it sound just lovely," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bain, with a thin-lipped smile. "Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll tell me how I got into this rotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not? It was Cherniy's idea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We've worked together for years--that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">why he like Macequece, close to the bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, y'see. Well, on this occasion I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot of trouble at Jo'burg. I have to get my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and the diamonds out of the country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without Chemly and you--well, I'm grate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful to the extent of five hundred pounds."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And Miss Sleigh, Jennifer?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Talman laughed. "You'll admit that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">has what it takes to make a man forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">his better judgment, Bain. Man bait. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">man bait!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross flushed. It was the unvarnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth, but he didn't like hearing it. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared enough to warn me. The thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled him, and he asked quickly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where's my boy, M'bani?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just forget about him.

"Sleigh tells me you're in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clined to throw your weight around. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't get funny with me, Bain. Sleigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't like to play rough, but I do. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member I can use you dead or alive. Bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter dead, perhaps. Go back to your tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stay there. We start for the coast at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunset."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Better dead than alive. Ross left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent with words ringing in his ears and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold feeling in the pit of his stomach. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutilated body, found in the - jungle with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Talman's passport, would suit Talman</seg><seg type="columnLine">much better, he had no illusions about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that! Even if Talman meant to play it</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight Amuku and the Swahilis would</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut his throat on the first opportunity. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was likely Talman had it figured that way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he knew fear--sheer, sweat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing panic. His first thought was to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">running, and his eyes swept the clearing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for something to dodge behind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They came to rest on Amuku, who stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching him, rifle in hand. With an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oath Ross got a grip on himself. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">now on someone would always be watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him. He'd have to depend on his wits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to his tent and took a stiff tot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brandy. He felt better. For days he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been blundering around in the dark. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew what he was up against. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides it was a way to the coast. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of something between here and Jo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobo. He poured out another tot of brandy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he put the glass down, a drum began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rumble over at the Makua village. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at his watch with a frown, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membering that he'd promised to pay Bo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metela this morning. It was a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes after noon. He remembered that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't told Sleigh about his agreement</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Makua chief. He took a pace</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the opening of his tent, then pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up short as the idea struck him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down turning it over in his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7--J ungle--Winter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Why should he tell Sleigh? If Bometela</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't paid he'd come to collect, backed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his young warriors, spoiling for a fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was cold blooded. If a false move was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it would end in a massacre. Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured himself another brandy and swal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed it. Well, he was as good as a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and so was M'bani. A man had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to gamble for his life. Let Bome-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tela come! With a grim smile Ross sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the sun declined from meridian the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maku war drums began to throb. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume of sound increased slowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross knew that Bometala was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">march. Presently one of the Swahilis</seg><seg type="columnLine">came running into the camp, shouting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleigh. Soon the whole dozen of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were grouped about Amuku, jabbering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesticulating. They were yapping about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Makua girl. They were scared. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">so were Sleigh and Talman, by the look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. They had come out of the mess</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent. Talman stood looking in the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the native village. Sleigh was</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving his arms at Amuku, ordering him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to serve out guns and ammunition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho, Bain! Come over here!" Sleigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross buckled on his empty gun-belt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sauntered over to them. The Makuas</seg><seg type="columnLine">were close now. The chant of the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors was audible above the rumble of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drums.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You settled with them about that girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't you?" Sleigh wanted to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't recall saying so," Ross mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mured. "We weren't able to reach an</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreement."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do they want?" demanded Tal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross jerked his thumb in Amuku's di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection, "Him," he said, laconically, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned as the other Swahilis edged away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their headman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Talman swore, "I'll give them a belly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful of lead, that's what!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you're thinking of that you'd better</seg><seg type="columnLine">give me a gun," suggested Ross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Talman looked at him, suspicion in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold eyes. "It could be that you're try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to work something, Bain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know their lingo," Sleigh put in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You don't need a gun to talk to them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">98	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, I'll talk to them," Ross agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't like it!" Talman interposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply. "Anybody else speak their lingo</seg><seg type="columnLine">in camp, Sleigh ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beads of sweat dropped from Sleigh's</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead as he shook his head. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swahilis were showing increasing signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nervousness as the' Makua war-chant</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew in volume.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess it's got beyond talking," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross with unruffled calm. "We'll all be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of Makua spears as my aunt's pin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cushion before long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the moment the Makua debouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the forest inito the clearing--tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-footed warriors all of them, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun gleaming on their oiled bodies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">winking on their spear heads. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a compact mass at the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clearing while their drums throbbed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frenzied rhythm. A truly terrifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. Talman and Sleigh were staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their mouths open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "For Pete's sake, do something,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bain!" Talman's voice quavered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're working themselves up!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped Sleigh, and started to back</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. The Swahilis stood utterly still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the white men, sensing their fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't move! Don't shoot!" Ross'</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice rang out clear, commanding obedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUDDENLY the drums stopped. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a blood-chilling howl the Makuas</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged. It was too much for the Swahilis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they dropped their guns and bolted for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush, Amuku well in the lead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panic was what Ross had gambled on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the Makuas swept across the clearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a cloud of dust, he swung on Sleigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was standing closest to him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow stunned Sleigh and he sank to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees. Before Talman realized what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">happening, Ross had scooped up Sleigh's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun and stood facing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Drop it, Talman!"

It seemed to be an</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy movement, using only a part of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. In that it was deceptive. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lash gathered speed to its moment of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pact and struck with the pain of a white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot wire, ripping the white cotton coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shirt that covered Yankee Jim's shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vorley took his time and1 swung again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again. The exertion had increased his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing.

His teeth were set, his arms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide with one of the askaris holding each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. Perspiration sprang to his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and ran down his lean leathery</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks. His Coat and shirt had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">chewed to strips by the lash, streaked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody</seg><seg type="columnLine">112	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So." Vorley stopped and breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily a while. "So much for one debt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So much for throwing schnapps in face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now for trying to cheat me of reward</seg><seg type="columnLine">moneys, I will give you perhaps six more."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yankee Jim was dizzy from pain. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the lash seemed to take something</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of him. It made his knees that much</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer to collapsing, the scream of pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that much closer to coming from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whip came down again, again. Vor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley moved back, using his forearm to wipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat from his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You still like mine whip?

Like so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd see you in hell first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you say. So many men say. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is different when flesh comes loose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone." He coiled the whip and rolled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve back down. "But I must congratu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late you. You take twelve stripes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make no sound. Mit native near, that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">goot.

Yankee Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped off his shirt and reversed it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to cover the deep whip gashes. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the best he could do for the moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later, with good fortune, he'd be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get palm oil and a soft pad of bark cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now to village?" Vorley asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. It's ten kilometers.

He motioned at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fallen natives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fear narrowed Vorley's eyes, "You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">think-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There have been no drums."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He exhaled, reassured but still suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious. It was true that Vorley was no fool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was wary. The lashing had helped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride, but he still hated Yankee Jim, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared him. He would let Jim live only as</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as his help was a necessity. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant only until he could get the girl to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of N'cimbo country beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cascades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RISING HEAT of afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">made travel difficult.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no others short of the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They walked through huge African teak</seg><seg type="columnLine">shading a saucer shaped basin. The tim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber ended, and they paused at the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clearing. A kilometer distant, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly below, lay a village built more</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the style of a Zulu kraal than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">single-street Bantu village prevalent in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Congo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The huts were round structures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardwood, bamboo and palm thatch.

When realization came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was lying on his back, arms stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide, wrists bound to piece of timber not</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike a crucifix.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drums were beating-tom-toms of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dozen sizes all throbbing the rhythm of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the black dance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He twisted from side to side. Thick,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">oil-tanmed thongs had been wrapped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around and around bis wrists.

By minute degrees the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tempo was mounting. Rising and falling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the drums came the wild, vengeful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chant of natives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He knew what would happen next. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tempo would suddenly change, and they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would come over for him, lift the crucifix</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, to which he was tied, and carry it to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fire and stand it there. They would dance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more wildly then with each warrior find-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing bits of thatch to throw at his feet un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">til the heap had grown waist high. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">might take till midnight, till next morn-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing, or noon. Finally, when they were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ready, fetish priests in black masks would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come from the voodoo hut and poke a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">burning stick into the heap. The stick</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would burn closer and closer, and that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wTould be the real torture--*--watching,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dreading the flame. At last, after an etern-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ity, a shaving or thatch blade would catch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and spread around him. After that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">end would be quick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He opened his eyes.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to stop at the last instant. A scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripped from his throat. He flung his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders back, arms high, but bent knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the branch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bent trunk was released like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty bow.
