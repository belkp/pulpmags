With the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a mood.

That was the thing that came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the house with the money. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the mood.

He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have to pussyfoot when he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongly about anything. He was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those strange products of Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington, a senator's secretary; a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with legal training and newspaper</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience, a sound body and a hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind--too young to be a senator him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self but with more knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">senator's job than the senator would</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever have.

He was holding his chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his chest and he had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair so that the shadows hid his</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression. Cooper shrugged and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention once more upon the sheets</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The penciled figures were the piles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of currency reduced to symbols; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">record of the senator's resources pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this house for some obscure rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. There were bank accounts that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had been closed out, stocks and bonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been sold, debts that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been collected. In none of the transac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions had a check figured. Every deal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the senator's insistence, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed in cash. And the cash was here</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the study of the senator's Virginia</seg><seg type="columnLine">home--heaps of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door to the big hall opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly and Cooper looked up. Hito,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Japanese man of all work, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing there, his squat body bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly forward, his beady black eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the senator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A Misser Terry Black to see you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You see him, yess?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice was a blend of hiss and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lisp that hit the esses hard.

Show him in, Hito."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned to Cooper as the Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed out. "This Black," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtfully.

I can't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greg Cooper snorted. He remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered Terry Black very well; a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression down-and-outer without a job</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had jumped off a park bench to</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock a gun out of the hand of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who tried to assassinate Brad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford Weller. It had been quite a show.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the newsreel cameras grinding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senator Weller had publicly presented</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry Black with a check for five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred dollars and solemnly accepted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">MONEY TO BURN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man's note in exchange. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">applauded for that; for saving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's pride while he paid him a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. Nobody who read the news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers or saw the newsreels took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loan angle seriously. Terry Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought his wife and youngster to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington and bought a taxicab.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now Bradford Weller was trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">collect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T11HE door to the big hall opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and Terry Black came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room. He was a slender man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">medium height with lean jaws, high</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheekbones and large eyes set deep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was wearing a blue serge suit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shiny from much pressing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a taxi driver's cap in one gnarled</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and a creased envelope in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. He bobbed his head rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">awkwardly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you do, Senator. I--I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">over as soon as I could."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The senator half rose to extend a</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp hand. "How are you, Black?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quite well, I hope. You are prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pick up your note, I presume?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry Black swallowed hard. "Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me, you know, that any time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bradford Weller cleared his throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisily. "That was two years ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black. I haven't pressed you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know." There was a strange ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression in the taxi driver's deep eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He laid the envelope on the senator's</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk.

Cut the note</seg><seg type="columnLine">in half."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached out one hand and drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the envelope to him. Terry Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched it across the desk top and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greg Cooper watched Terry Black.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was perspiration heavy on Greg</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cooper's forehead again. He was, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, looking at an honorable man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who met his debts when they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">called; whatever the price to himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The taxi driver's shoulders slumped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, sir," he said. "Thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to go and his eyes rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Greg Cooper's desk and on the box</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside it; the desk that was stacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with currency and the box that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with it. His slightly stooped fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure became rigid. He stared hard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then his eyes swung back to the sena-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor. Bradford Weller was counting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money that he had taken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the envelope and he did not look up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry Black swore under his breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">put his cap on his head and stalked</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the room. Greg Cooper looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was an honorable man when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in," he thought. "What was he</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he went out ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something had risen out of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">greed-polluted room and entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul of Terry Black. Greg Cooper had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen it happen. He passed the hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerchief across his forehead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked toward the senator. Bradford</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weller tossed the currency-stuffed en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velope from one desk to the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two hundred and fifty more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cooper," he said. "Make a record of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greg Cooper made no comment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were times when the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his command were inadequate to</seg><seg type="columnLine">express his thoughts or his feelings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had no awe of the senator. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">written speeches for Bradford Weller</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Weller could never have written</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. He had written diplomatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters to irate constituents and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ferreted out the hidden hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind important bills so that the sena-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor could line up on the right side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had no more illusions about states-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manship and he knew the senator for</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he was. Yet strangely, he had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">affection of a kind for the man; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affection of a foster parent for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoiled and detestable brat which has,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nevertheless, a helpless appeal. Brad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford Weller couldn't walk alone in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">world of politics but he thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could and he was quite vain. Cooper</seg><seg type="columnLine">granted him his vanity and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him. It was all part of a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">political secretary's job.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room was quiet again. Cooper</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the pencil entry on a long sheet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ink entry in a ledger. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked through the thin sheaf of tens</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twenties for which Terry Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">had entered the slave ranks of a loan</seg><seg type="columnLine">shark, then tossed the bills into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box with the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door at the end of the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened. Hito was bowing to the sena-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Misser George Arlington. You see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, yess?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At sound of the name, Cooper raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head sharply.

Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll see him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was squaring away behind his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk like a man of affairs rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the idle dreamer of a long after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon. He made a gesture toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cooper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You might drop the lid on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">box," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cooper had acted ahead of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand.

Six feet tall and over</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred pounds, he looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wealthy western cattleman dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the city. He was carrying a pearl</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray Stetson of the broad-brim type</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand. A broad, white-toothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile split his bronzed face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, Senator. I'm glad to see you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">A whiff of lilac blew across the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Greg Cooper wrinkled his nose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes had narrowed and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting stiffly behind his own desk. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">name George Arlington had been fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar but he had been willing to grant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that more than one man might</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear the name. There was no mistak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the big man in the gray suit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue shirt, however. They had met</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.

The two men looked at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and Greg Cooper was outside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret that they shared. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was outside and that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing that he could do about it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">senator had taken the bit in his teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this once before.

He had his arms folded across</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest and his right hand was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his armpit. He was a guard who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been hired by the day from a famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">detective agency.

This was Tim Weller, a Federal</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge once in the long ago, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elder brother of the senator. Tim Wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler had given up his own political</seg><seg type="columnLine">career when his brother started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb. He was old now, but still the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiser of the two men when he cared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak his mind. At the moment, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin was on his chest and he seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be asleep.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">senator was a bachelor and Emily a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinster. She had been a shrewd hostess</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a town where a woman can make</seg><seg type="columnLine">or break a man by her skill in enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining.

There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a burlesque house and a hamburger</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, a couple of chili parlors, several</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloons, two theaters specializing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grade B westerns--and Hannigan's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hannigan's was a restaurant and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon and a club of sorts. Burglars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pickpockets, petty grifters and yegg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men down on their luck made a hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of Hannigan's and Big Steve Han-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nigan minded his own business. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew his customers by name and repu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation and business, but if they behaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves in his place, he didn't care</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they might plan there against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peace and the well-being of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. The police kept an eye on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they didn't tap anybody on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder in Hannigan's; they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">their collars outside. On the whole, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a decent place; a little long on</seg><seg type="columnLine">odors and short on beauty, but dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creetly shadowed and fitted with booths</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were not sounding boards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beau Bridwell wasn't there, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hannigan knew where he could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found. "I'll have him here in five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, skipper," he said. Cooper</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seated himself in a booth, ordered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beer and waited. Beau Bridwell showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in four minutes flat. Hannigan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">service was always good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE years had not been kind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bridwell. He was undersized and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoop-shouldered and he entered a door</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a kind of furtive duck that</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him in sidewise. His pasty</seg><seg type="columnLine">white face was covered with dirty gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubble. His eyes rolled uneasily under</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushy eyebrows that were already</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You got something for me, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cooper?" he croaked.

Have a beer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cooper gave the order for the beer</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would keep Hannigan from but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting in for a few minutes. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">measuring Bridwell thoughtfully. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hard to believe that this shabby</seg><seg type="columnLine">little down-and-outer had once been</seg><seg type="columnLine">an aristocrat of the underworld; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">master hand at the art of opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">safes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got a box to be opened, Beau,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man jerked convulsively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His lips worked. "Nix. I'm all washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. One more rap would finish me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm running straight, Mr. Cooper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is straight, Beau. I'll take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsibility. I am Senator Weller's</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary. I'll let you into his house and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you open the box. You do not steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything and you won't have to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">from cops or worry about burglar</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarms."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man stopped the nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerking of his features. He lived in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a world of sharp dealing, of chiseling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of games and rackets that played along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fringe of the law. His eyes stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling and concentrated shrewdly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cooper's face. He saw an angle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he was wondering how far he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">play along in safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You ain't risking a swell job and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rep to glom some of the senator's</seg><seg type="columnLine">marbles," he said finally.

He wiped his lips with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers. "If you wasn't a friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">o' mine when you was on the papers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wouldn't touch it," he said. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend or no friend, I gotta have a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">o' money for my work.

I ain't scared o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber in your paper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man had thrown off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of frightened humility. Cooper had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to him and Cooper had hired</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for a job that no one else could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. The thought gave him dignity. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a certain grim stubbornness under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dignity, too. Measuring him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cooper knew that the man would stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the demand for a hundred dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not a cent less. Cooper laid his</seg><seg type="columnLine">check flat on the sticky table top and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One hundred dollars, Beau.

Beau Bridwell took one</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at the check and folded it away</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly. There was a tightening in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's slack lips, a gleam in his eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cooper rose slowly. He could read in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's face the reason for the swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceptance of the check idea, the fix-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the amount above what a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be expected to carry in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That check was Beau Bridwell's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surance against a frame-up or a slip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was his proof of employment by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greg Cooper. Cooper's lips twisted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wry grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped out of the booth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped short with surprise. Terry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black, the taxi driver, was sitting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stool at the bar with a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiskey in his hand and his eyes fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the booth. When he saw Cooper's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes on him, he turned his back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddled over the whiskey glass. Greg</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cooper's eyes narrowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strode out to his car. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken a long step. If everything went</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right tonight, he would take a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and fifty odd thousands of dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the senator's safe. Provided that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not interrupted, he would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">that money and hide it in a panel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had discovered years ago in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parlor mantel. There would be hell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay in the morning but until the sena-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor found his money, he would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to lose any of it to blondes, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence men or second story workers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not stealing money, he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself; it was removing it from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">control of its owner during a period</seg><seg type="columnLine">of danger.

He looked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was Vi Dawson, a sweet child</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her way and quite pretty. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little bit sorry for her because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl would probably have to bear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brunt of her aunt's peevishness when</seg><seg type="columnLine">this business was done.

Young</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotions, he felt, were essentially shal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, subject to too many future</seg><seg type="columnLine">stresses which they probably would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">survive. Only rich maturity could know</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full flower of love. He looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mildred Harney and his shoulders un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciously squared. Mike Deshler</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Hito had come in. He had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">full audience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SLOWLY, with complete apprecia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the dramatic hush in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, the senator moved out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind his desk. He stood, as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">often stood before the senate; his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown back, his audience in a semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle about him. He had a speech to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliver, too, and his eyes were glitter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing points of light behind slitted lids.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would give them the speech and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would watch it strike and wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, watch them stiffen with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock of what he was going to do.

He took a back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward step and cursed himself inwardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for weakness. He was afraid of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother, afraid of the wrath in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">older man's eyes. The conciliatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits of the years ate at his resolve.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, behind him he heard the snap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping crackle of the flames as the paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazed under Hito's match. His back</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffened at the sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nevertheless," he said, "the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">is mine and I choose to burn it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vivian Dawson was standing.

Bradford Weller could see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from where he stood facing his brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he decided suddenly that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid, too, of Cooper.

Vivian Daw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son was looking bitterly at Greg</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cooper. Mike Deshler had his big fists</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched and the perspiration was run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning in large, rolling beads through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seams in his battered face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One hundred thousand dollars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isn't that enough to burn?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greg Cooper's voice snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the tension in the room.

Cooper matched the sena-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor's shrug with one of his own.

He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling good again. He had been chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenged to stop and he had asserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. He felt invincible. The blonde</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl had one leg across the corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his desk and she was very close to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even closer than the physical contact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told himself, there was a mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">bond.

It was the ultimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">test of human love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The senator was feeling better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ever had. When Tim Weller rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went out of the room without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, the senator smiled. The symbol</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his enslavement to relatives and</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsibility was going up in smoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The relatives, themselves, were walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out on the show.

He had to drive even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought from his mind if he were to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoy his triumph. She was so com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely the ruler of this house and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominator of all men that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even be able to command the alle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">giance of Cooper and of Hito if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">were here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She won't be able to do a thing,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reflected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was a thought that pleased him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he held to it. He would be out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the reach of her wrath when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned what had happened and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be helpless to undo what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. The idea of Emily being help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less was the most pleasant thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were only a few packages</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and he watched them hit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames and catch fire with a feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unholy glee. Hito staggered a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the effects of the heat as he rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet. Greg Cooper made a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of marks with his pencil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One hundred and fifty-four thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, seven hundred and sixty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars," he said mechanically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The senator rubbed his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's fine," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine if you think so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greg Cooper hurled the pencil into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire and stalked out of the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The senator called to him and he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not turn around. The door slammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him and Hito looked to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">senator for instructions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">r&gt; RADFORD WELLER looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire. "Scatter the ashes well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hito," he said.

He was about to knock</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly when he became aware of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that Vivian was speaking to some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. He stopped with his hand raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the other voice answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could not distinguish words but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second voice was the voice of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blonde, Mildred Harney.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He let his hand drop arid went slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly up the hall.

Under present circumstances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mildred Harney would not be talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Vi out of any feeling of affection.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was the kind of a person who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">axes to grind.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock of her uncle's bitter speech and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his destruction of the money had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been hard enough to bear, but Greg</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cooper's failure to make a fight on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue had been disillusioning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He was so weak, so helpless.

As she stood in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the room with her fists</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched, she saw her own reflection</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mirror.

It was close enough to three</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock to justify going downstairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His watch had a luminous dial and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not needed a light.

Cooper</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood with his hands on his hips. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes shifted from one man to the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry Black showed less fear but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was trembling with nervousness. Beau</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bridwell kept moistening his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two men to one and with a gun in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand of one of them, they had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage over Cooper and they seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmindful of it. If they wanted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contents of the safe enough to pull a</seg><seg type="columnLine">doublecross to get it, they could still</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry out their original intention. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">his check in Beau Bridwell's pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greg Cooper was in no position to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">for help. The thought, however, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not alarm him. He felt there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was dealing with a broken yegg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had dropped into the ranks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of petty thievery and with a desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxi driver who had turned crooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">only because he had learned bitterness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had washed his bitterness down</seg><seg type="columnLine">with too much liquor. Small time</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooks were always frightened by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of a big job. Their imaginations</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not equal to it. They would steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred or two--and maybe slap a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man like Cooper out of the way to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">it; but a safe holding thousands was</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightening. They let fright paralyze</seg><seg type="columnLine">MONEY TO BURN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Cooper shoved his jaw forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">aggressively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put that gun on the table, Black!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he growled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The taxi driver stopped trembling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a second his eyes were hot with</seg><seg type="columnLine">defiance; then he shrugged and laid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun down. "You got most of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong," he said. "This ain't a double-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross. It's a different deal, that's all. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to bring Beau out here even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you hadn't got to him first.

It was the fear of big money again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beau Bridwell had sunk to a level</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he knew that the mere posses-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of money in large amounts would</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruin him. He wouldn't have dared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it--even with it lying under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.

"There was what?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Somebody down here in this room."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two men were looking at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cooper shook his head slowly. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">regretting that nap that he had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">upstairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you get the box open?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bridwell shook his head. "Nope. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay. Open it up." Cooper sat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner of his own desk. He ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured with one hand toward the ashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fireplace. "There are people in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this house," he said, "who will bet you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there is a lot of money in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashes and nothing in the safe. I'll re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse the bet. I'll bet you that there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing in the ashes and a lot of money</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the safe.

There was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Italian stiletto, that had probably come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his own collection, buried hilt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep in his chest. His fingers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting lightly upon the hilt as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had plunged the stiletto home and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then relaxed his grip as death took</seg><seg type="columnLine">him away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the cruel light of the central ceil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fixture that he so seldom used, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bald head gleamed.

Now Bradford Weller was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead. There was a fine irony in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Cooper could not see the possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive. He did not believe that sane</seg><seg type="columnLine">people killed for vengeance unless there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was another powerful factor working.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were people in the household</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were resentful, but they were peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple capable of seeing that murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make a bad situation worse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T I ''HERE was a clicking sound from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cooper turned.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinked at the light and ran one thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand through his disheveled gray hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bradford," he said huskily. "Dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He continued to blink into the glare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room. He did not have his cane</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he gripped the door frame for sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port. Cooper nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he said gently. "He's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead for hours, I imagine. His body is</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim Weller continued to stare at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. "He was mad," he said. "In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sane."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think so." Cooper had</seg><seg type="columnLine">started for the telephone but he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. "You'd better go to your room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judge. It's pretty tough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He never called Tim Weller "Judge"</seg><seg type="columnLine">except on special occasions.

"You know," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "I made Bradford. Started him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in law. Made a politician out of him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know." Cooper picked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone. He swore softly. There w'as no</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzz in the receiver. The old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up. Cooper put the phone back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the stand. "The wire is cut," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was frowning again. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cold-blooded, professional touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">about cutting the phone wires. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked casually along the line. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't see the break and because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't, he found the wire-cutting more</seg><seg type="columnLine">baffling. A phone in a bedroom would</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally be an extension phone. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolate a house without phone service,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line would have to be cut down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An amateur would never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of that," he said aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim Weller blinked at him. "What?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cooper shrugged. "Somebody fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured that he needed a head start."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved away from the phone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the body on the bed. Despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">his newspaper experience, he felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer sense of helplessness that sweeps</seg><seg type="columnLine">a person in the face of violent death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would have to go after help now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had a strong disinclination to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go. The murderer might want just that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he couldn't figure out any rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son w'hy the murderer would want him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the house--except that the safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been empty when he had Beau</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bridwell open it. If the safe had held a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small fortune in money earlier in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening--as he suspected--then its</seg><seg type="columnLine">present emptiness provided a possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive for murder and a good reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the murderer to want a head start</seg><seg type="columnLine">or time to hide the money after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money was considered. Cooper swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you come downstairs tonight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judge, after once you went to bed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim Weller blinked. "Downstairs?</seg><seg type="columnLine">No."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Somebody did." Cooper ground his</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms together thoughtfully. Tim Wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler lifted his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you know?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cooper did not answer. He was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membering what Beau Bridwell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terry Black had told him. They de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">layed their attack on the safe because</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been someone in the senator's</seg><seg type="columnLine">study. Cooper's eyes passed over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean body of Tim Weller. It was easier</seg><seg type="columnLine">to believe the Judge than to disbelieve</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. It would take a strong motive to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make Tim Weller negotiate stairs that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't have to climb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at the corpse.

Who was left?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girls? Yes. Either one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been in the study. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that either one had. Hito?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, he would have to check up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. The thought of Hito gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">an idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't have to go for the police.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had someone to send.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll have to consider the possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Bridwell and Black lied," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought grimly.

There was a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a criminal record who had one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greg Cooper's checks that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn on the day his employer wras</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greg Cooper had had the opportu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nity personally--and any one of sev-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">2	D--19</seg><seg type="columnLine">MONEY TO BURN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eral motives that would look good to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police--for murdering Bradford</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was aware of Tim Weller's</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinking eyes fixed upon him. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how long the old man had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">studying him, but Tim Weller was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewd. He might be Greg Cooper's</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst witness before a grand jury if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to that. His report on Cooper's</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual actions in the death room</seg><seg type="columnLine">would carry weight. The old man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodding his head slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is no disgrace for a crazy man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill himself," he said huskily.

"I'm sorry, Judge," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "but it isn't that simple. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">commit suicide. He wras murdered."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Murdered?" Tim Weller raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, his eyes widening and, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, ceasing to blink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right.

The girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">took turns taking care of each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there was a difference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vi Dawson had gone to pieces with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock but had found herself when</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was danger to be met.

Instantly there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash of flame from a point near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garage. The dark figure folded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down and Cooper saw another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man crawling out of the garage shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ow, raising himself for another shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold it!" Cooper shouted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started forward. He had lost the sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of personal danger. He knew only that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man out on the lawn had been hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that, with the car lights from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highway behind him, he would be a still</seg><seg type="columnLine">target for the other marksman. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something chilling about the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of seeing a bullet pumped into a fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Cooper raced toward the garage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man with the gun got up on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee. He was wobbling badly but fight-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for balance. Cooper put on a last</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst of speed and struck at the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his open hand. The gun spun end</seg><seg type="columnLine">over end and the man who had wielded</seg><seg type="columnLine">it sank forward on the grass. Cooper</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hito!" he said. "You're hit, aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shot bad." The Japanese rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. He was shaking his head. Blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed over the front of his light pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jama jacket. Greg Cooper dropped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one knee beside him and the Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew a deep sobbing breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lady scream," he said, "and I get</seg><seg type="columnLine">up.

Cooper was wadding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief against the man's wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looking toward the road. A car</seg><seg type="columnLine">with green lights had pulled in through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gates and there were two men with</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashlights moving gingerly toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who was lying on the lawn. Hito</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shoot to scare," he said. "Not try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hit.

One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cops threw a flashlight beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him and he knew that there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun pointed down the beam.

He was wearing the uniform of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the District Park Police that limited</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jurisdiction to the Mount Vernon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Highway, but he had the aggressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of a man who, having blun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered into something, intends to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">it through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's it all about?" he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cooper shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know yet myself. Our Jap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anese servant shot someone running</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.

Three men piled out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered into conversation with the po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licemen down on the grounds.

Arlington's small eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened wide.

Tim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weller sank into a chair, his eyes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mildred Harney's face.

The clouds had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead and a full moon shed its cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">light over the scene. There was no sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two men.

Back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him there was nothing but floodwater,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile-wide bay of it glittering omi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nously under the moon.

That had been years ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The siding was largely overgrown with</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeds now. A little string of boxcars</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there; the door of one was open</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit, and the moonlight revealed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectangular ends of hay bales inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little strings of boxcars held no</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest for the young interne.

Twelve miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Riverside he remembered the brake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man saying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It might as well have been twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred. Danny couldn't walk it; not</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak as he was, drenched and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">chattering teeth, with a head which</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst from smouldering pain into red</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony at every step he took.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned, stumbled across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge. There was a dirt grade cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with a cattleguard, beyond that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden gate crossing a clay-packed</seg><seg type="columnLine">road. It wasn't really a road, but a lane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the end of the lane, Danny could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see a little dark clump of farm build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The farmer would have an automo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bile, a telephone, or at least a horse:</seg><seg type="columnLine">some means of communicating with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city.

The building was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small oblong of dingy gray, set in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddy flat yard with barns and sheds</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the rear. The sound of Danny's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knuckles on the door echoed across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard; brought no other response.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He muttered, teeth clacking, "G-got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to b-break in!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the door wasn't locked. Danny</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed into the stale warmth of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen.

It howled</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasantly into the pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A coffee pot with some dark liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it stood on the back of the stove.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would be hot by the time he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">some dry clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny took down the lamp, pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the door at the other end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen, stopped short. "Holy--!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A MAN lay on the floor just over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the threshold.

An irregular red blotch, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of a dinner plate, stained the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">all bib. There was a good deal more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot more, red on the carpet about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The man had been shot, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the heart, but in the lung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny Lane stood stock-still a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, his throat contracting as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared.

After that moment, he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">away; climbed the stairs to the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">story.

It did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">occur to him that the farmer's death</seg><seg type="columnLine">might in any way be linked with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train robbery. He was not one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">super-sleuths who can be knocked cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">one moment and wake up the next with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a perfect crime solution in mind. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a sleuth at all, just an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted youth, with one thought inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">his battered skull; to get to Riverside</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tell his story to the authorities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny went outside. The eastern sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brightened to a pale mauve which</seg><seg type="columnLine">found reflection in the swollen pond</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering the lower end of the farm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fence lines marched down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, disappeared; the brown thatch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a haystack made a tiny island in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His stare stopped on a muddy ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps forty feet in diameter, a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods from the water and near another</seg><seg type="columnLine">stack, sliced in two like a loaf of bread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It held no particular meaning for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked across the barnyard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were a good many footprints</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mud.

A move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment inside made his pulse leap, sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crackle of agony through his bruised</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. Then Danny grunted--it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a rat scurrying along a manger</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber. Three cows and a team were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabled in the stalls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny's lips twisted in perplexity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A salty rime of sweat traced the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of harness on the horses. Danny</seg><seg type="columnLine">went in, mumbled, "Who-a-a, boy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and touched one of the rumps. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse was warm. The mud on its fet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locks looked fresh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny Lane muttered, "Well I'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time, his fogged brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to grip a meaning in all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances. He came out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barn, hurrying, and looked around</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TI&gt;ACK of the barn, the cattleyard</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a straw-choked quagmire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danny circled the hen house and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plement shed, came abruptly onto a lip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old quarry. It had been closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">commercially for years; but some stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">for local use had been coming out</seg><seg type="columnLine">lately. A wagon track meandered down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the quarry floor. There was a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanse of bare rock across the quarry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beyond that a view of the railroad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A long ways off, Danny could see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving dot. He strained to focus his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes on it. The dot took form--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of an old-fashioned handcar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danny could make out the tiny figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man pumping it along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The interne started down the wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail into the pit. His jarring footfalls</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased the torment in his head as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked his way carefully. A thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange-peel of sun slid over the hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zon as he pushed through the bushes</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the other end of the quarry and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out onto the track siding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A frown tightened Danny's tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">face as he inspected the scene. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddy road along the track was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blandly smooth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But nevertheless the door of the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxcar of the string on the siding, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed. It had been open during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. And the rising sun discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">MERCY, HIJACKED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">certain tiny marks on the rails--</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter bits visible where the rust was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny lurched through the mud, got</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands onto that door. A surge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body moved it only an inch. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next try he got it six inches farther.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently he had an opening wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to admit a man's body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He jumped weakly, succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasping the latch with one hand. Claw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing desperately, he got the toe of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoe braced onto the metal-stripped sill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He climbed shakily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boxcar was filled nearly to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof. There was barely room for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danny to crawl across the tiers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">baled hay. He peered at the bales. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">would weigh around a hundred pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was encircled by two wires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lacking a pincers, he struggled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break one of the wires. Bare hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't do it. Danny drove his heel</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the bale, used all the strength in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his leg, and the wire snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hay bulged out in accordion</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleats. Danny muttered, "Yeah!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove his hands into the pleats. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted out a small wooden box and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again muttered, "Yeah!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't need to open the box. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what it contained.

The oral vaccine was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideal for flood conditions--you didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">need complicated equipment, your pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tients didn't suffer the severe reactions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But still, It could be used only by a phy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sician. No doctor or hospital would buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything like that except through legiti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate supply channels. What in the devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">could the hijackers do with it? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, that problem wasn't for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danny's aching head to solve.

If it had not been for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost miraculous discovery, this box-</seg><seg type="columnLine">car's contraband cargo would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound up in Dr. Randall's stock barns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How did this tie up with Torres' dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny shook his head slowly. Prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was all coincidence--just as much a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of accident as the fact that he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall's interne, had gotten off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train last night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood up, thrust the cards into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">overall pocket, turned to look after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">handcar. It had already _vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a curve below the bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaned against the boxcar, stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully up the barren track to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward Riverside. Gradually his stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowed. There was something wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this scene. Only the rails, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeds growing up to the trackside, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gray waste of water beyond. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">MERCY, HIJACKED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something wrong! Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing missing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet for the life of him, Danny</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't think what. Whatever it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eluded his pain-numbed wits. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled to remember--and failed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like having a name almost at the tip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your tongue, but only almost. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps if he didn't think about it for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, the correct answer would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny jerked around, warned too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late by the sound of a footstep. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising sun silhouetted a head and shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders leaning around the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxcar, cast a reddish glimmer along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rifle barrel aimed at the interne's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come along quiet," the silhouette</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "We got you covered from both</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True enough, they had both ends of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the siding covered. Another man came</seg><seg type="columnLine">up behind Danny, snouted a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his back, and said: "Walk a'</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail, kid. We ain't leaving any foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prints, see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They all walked the rails, Danny</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of the others. Sometimes, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head swimming dizzily, the interne</seg><seg type="columnLine">would stumble and be rewarded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They headed him away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarry, down the track and across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattleguard at the road, until they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a cindered footpath leading back un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Down here, kid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bridge stood on tall, creosote-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated timbers. Flood , water had</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed in, was within eight feet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepers overhead. One of the men went</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of Danny, up to the wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">planks at the lower end of the bridge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a retaining wall, built to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roadbed from landsliding into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek bottom there. The man lifted two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planks aside, said: "You crawl</seg><seg type="columnLine">in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two planks had concealed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of concrete ditch tile. The tile</seg><seg type="columnLine">was barely large enough for a man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawl through. Danny could see a glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of white light at the other end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man with the rifle prodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danny. "Now crawl!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The interne crept into the tile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He emerged into a cave hollowed un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the railroad. It was shored up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">boards, lighted by an electric lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung on a twisted copper tube. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube was part of an old still. Clearly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave had been a bootlegger hideout</seg><seg type="columnLine">during Prohibition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were already two men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dugout. One of these was a pug-nosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, slouch-hatted, with an air of</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority about him. Much of the au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thority derived from the revolver in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny blinked. He'd never seen a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it before. An H&amp;R .38, with three</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches of knife steel protruding from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barrel end--an ugly little bayonet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other man crouched in a corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cave, almost hidden in shadow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knees were drawn almost level with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tropic-skinned features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny muttered, "Torres!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big brown man stared but said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dannv growled, "So it was an inside</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">job!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE pug-nosed one turned the lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tern, aimed its beam squarely onto</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danny. "Never mind him--I'll do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking for the outfit," he said harshly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen, young fella. You want to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of here alive, don't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The question required no answer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Danny gave none.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, you do," Pug Nose said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you can--if you obey orders."</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused, while the other two came</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling into the dugout. Their bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringed Danny into an uncomfortably</seg><seg type="columnLine">small space. Pug Nose drew a slip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow paper from his pocket, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small pencil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You write what I tell you," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Put it in your own words. Just say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a gang has got the vaccine. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">want twenty thousand for it. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">they come across with the dough, we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn you loose to tell them where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff is hidden. They'll know it's on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the level, having your name signed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the note."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny nodded, said, "Sure, I'll do</seg><seg type="columnLine">that." Because, by this time the brake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man would be phoning in the mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In old five dollar bills," Pug Nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Tell 'em to send one man in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowboat along the south shore until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sees a blue shirt waved on a stick. Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny didn't hear the rest. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at the yellow slip of paper. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank check, it had Mutual Savings &amp;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trust printed in big letters across its</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. At the stub side was pictured a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree; smaller letters said, Big Oaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Tiny Acorns Grow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Danny Lane knew what he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been trying to remember. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of it leaped like flame in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain. A crazy flame, burning rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son clean out of him. He forgot that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one against four--and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four were armed. Forgot that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakened by exposure, that his skull</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a thing of torture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny Lane snarled--and smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fist into the pug-nosed one's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't knock the man flat. Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it. The blow was only a gesture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more hurtful than a woman's slap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it brought them all down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Pug Nose's backhanded punch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked Danny to the wall. The rifle's</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt crashed into his groin as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Torres came plunging out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his corner of the cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Torres brought plenty of noise with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. There was baling wire around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big brown man's waist, wire firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted onto the boards at that end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dug-out. Along with the noise, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big man brought the whole boarded-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, ripping the timbers right out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shower of dirt cascaded onto</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danny Lane's head. The dugout was</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of falling dirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny heard a scream: "She's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a-cavin'!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In fact, the whole roof tottered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned. A cloud of dust obscured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern. In the gray half-light, Danny</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the three hijackers simultaneously</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap for the tile's mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What followed wasn't pretty. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were two men wedged and struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tile, screaming and cursing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fought. And there was the pug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosed man standing over them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipping that bayoneted revolver into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the squirming flesh of his partners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Torres stood watching, twisting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">big arms out of the wire. He didn't say</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This lasted perhaps fifteen seconds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then Torres had his arms free.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His hand shot out, caught the pug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosed one by the neck. Shook him, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrier would shake a rat, and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him aside. He reached down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged the other two out of the tile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in each hand, and smashed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads together. Then he threw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on top of Pug Nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bad hombre, that Torres.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, quite gently, he took Danny's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and pushed him to the hole's</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening. He still hadn't said a word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3	D--19</seg><seg type="columnLine">MERCY, HIJACKED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ECAUSE he couldn't say any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing," Danny Lane explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was later, of course. Danny rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a cot in the refugee camp, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head swathed in a great many band-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages, and talked a good deal more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lucy Orr than any nurse ought to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">her patient talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They had tape inside his mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his teeth," said Danny. "So he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't warn me. You see, they'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted him to write the note and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't--figured they'd kill him after</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got the money, rather than leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a witness alive. He'd seen a lot too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. He got off the train just before</seg><seg type="columnLine">it pulled away, and saw the last of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbery. Being unarmed, he ran up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Barker farmhouse to give the alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lucy said, "But Barker was in it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not in the hold-up itself. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a team hitched to the hay baler, so they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hide the loot. An old trick that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang had used. They used to ship out</seg><seg type="columnLine">booze from Barker's still that way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyhow, Barker saw Torres go up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. He followed with a gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And stood guard over him. But Torres</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a break, and in the fight over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, killed Barker. But when he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the house, the rest of the gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">were there and had him covered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny thought a minute. "So they</seg><seg type="columnLine">baled the vaccine into the hay% That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the ker-thunk sound I heard. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the time I got to the farmhouse, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were loading those bales into the car.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They ran the car down to the bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threw out part of the hay in it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and substituted the contraband. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">used a trainman's spud to push the box-</seg><seg type="columnLine">car back up the siding, leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks on the rails I saw. That's why</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there weren't any footprints around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">siding in the mud."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lucy frowned. "But if the car was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being shipped to Randall's farm--?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They knew it wouldn't go in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry. Common freight like that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand on a siding somewhere while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief food trains came through. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">car wouldn't be opened for weeks,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Danny, "no matter who'd bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hay from Barker. Randall being</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it was just coincidence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blonde girl shook her head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "But what possessed you to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight all those men when you even</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought Torres was one of the hijack</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," muttered Danny, apolo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getically. "I didn't have a chance. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I lost my head when I realized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brakeman was the gang's inside man</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that my message would never be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">livered by him. Because he was the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who pulled the cord to stop the Special</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the robbery--and tipped off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang in the dugout to nab me this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning,, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her blue eyes were surprised, dubi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous. "How could you know that?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The check reminded me. The pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of a tree on it. That's what I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to remember," said Danny. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">brakeman claimed to know the quarry</seg><seg type="columnLine">spur so well. But when the Special</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, I overheard him tell Torres</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was probably a tree blown onto</seg><seg type="columnLine">the track."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slow grin spread over most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danny Lane's face, the part of his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">which wasn't hidden in bandages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, honey, I had looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down that track both ways.

I knew all you guys were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing long jolts and I knew you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be depended on, so in order to convince</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deputy that I was on the level with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my snitching I had some of these guys</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying chuck to the cellhouses</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked over. They weren't our kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of people anyway, and none of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doing a long time, so my con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">science don't hurt me none for what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. The result is that we are all work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the night shift and got the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance we'll ever have of leaving this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place without telling the deputy goodby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What do you guys think of the way I</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned this thing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," drawled Red, "I'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit that you got us in a pretty good</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot to lam the joint, but somehow or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other I don't think I could have put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finger on those other guys. Still, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose it was necessary in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">BIG HOUSE CATS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">get in the deputy's confidence and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">him accept your recommendations as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us guys."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those guys who got knocked over</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the chuck don't mean a thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us," said Mickey. "The most of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">are 'Honest Johns' anyway, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days they put up in the hole ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to hurt them. Now we'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get our heads together and figure out</seg><seg type="columnLine">how we're going to crash the joint. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't want to lose too much time, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither do we want to go into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing without figuring every angle. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">we mess up this chance we'll never</seg><seg type="columnLine">get another one like it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Night after night Mickey and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">three companions went over every de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail of their escape plan. Saw blades</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cut the bars of the basement win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow, civilian clothing to don after</seg><seg type="columnLine">scaling the wall, an automobile for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a getaway, these were all discussed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, after several weeks discussion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plans were complete and a definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">date was set for the escape. Hacksaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">blades had been stolen from the auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobile tag plant and were secreted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kitchen ready for use. Saturday</seg><seg type="columnLine">night was set as the time for the es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape, Mickey arguing that Sunday</seg><seg type="columnLine">would afford better opportunities for</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoiding the dragnet which would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown out for them. Mickey's com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions were jubilant over the pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pects of early liberty which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be almost within their grasp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were loud in their praise of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had made it possible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to escape. Mickey also seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be well pleased, but he told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others he was doing this as much for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself as for then*. If his companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been present at an interview be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the prisoner and the deputy</seg><seg type="columnLine">warden they would have had a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding of the patience with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which Mickey had planned the escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eagerness for his companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">to join him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you, Deputy," said Mickey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"when I first came here that I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make you the best informer you ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, and in return I, of course, expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to do something for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You won't lose anything by help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me," said the deputy. "However, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can do is make recommendations to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warden, but any time a man does</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything for me which I believe de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serves a return favor I'll go to the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him until he is rewarded. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have, as you say, been a good man</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me, but still you haven't done any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that warrants me trying to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">your time reduced."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're right, Deputy," said Mickey</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, sir, you're exactly right, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I've been doing is using my head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've been gaining the confidence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate characters in the prison.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What would you say if I told you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of the worst men you have here</seg><seg type="columnLine">are planning to escape and if it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been for me you w'ould not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known anything about it until after</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were gone ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are they?" asked the deputy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to conceal his eagerness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to tell you that," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mickey, "but, first you realize that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">these men had succeeded in getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the newspapers would have put</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and the warden on the pan for it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now I think that I deserve some credit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for stopping this escape, for I am now</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a position to do exactly that.

These</seg><seg type="columnLine">guys expect me to go with them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to throw off suspicion I'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pretend that I am going along. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have a long rope with a hook on</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to use in climbing the wall, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can tell your guards that I will be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth one to go over so they won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot at me. In that way it won't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread over the prison that I stooled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on these fellows. If you want to, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can keep me in the dungeon a few days</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make it look on the level."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The deputy agreed to the plan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised that the men would not es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," he said, "I could put</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in solitary confinement before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they tried to escape, but if I did that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wouldn't have any evidence on them</seg><seg type="columnLine">except your story and the chances are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warden wouldn't stand for them</seg><seg type="columnLine">being kept in solitary on that alone, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll let them go through with the es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape and have enough guards planted</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the wall to stop them if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to mow them down to do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mickey was well pleased with him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and began to plan on enjoying his</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberty within two years instead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five years the judge had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but to his companions he talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stolen liberty which he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be theirs w'ithin a few days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mickey found himself unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep on the Friday preceding the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">set for the escape.

Bob Durant, an oil stock swindler</seg><seg type="columnLine">serving a term in a western prison, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the central figure in a case of this kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Durant was educated, more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">refined, and was of a type among whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">are seldom found informers.

Because of his like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able personality and readiness at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">times to write letters for other inmates</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to advise them, he was liked by</seg><seg type="columnLine">both officials and the inmate body. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At some time during his life Durant</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done newspaper work and his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributions to the prison publication</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that he possessed some writing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability and for this reason he was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted to organize the first journalism</seg><seg type="columnLine">class in the prison. Durant was smart</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to realize that his success with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this class would probably determine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of time he would have to serve</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on his five-year term, consequently he</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked tirelessly with his students.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Durant soon learned that his class</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more interested in fiction writing</seg><seg type="columnLine">than reportorial work, so he frequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave them story assignments based</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon plots which he would outline for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.

That is why I am going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give you an idea for a story to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night which will have a prison as its</seg><seg type="columnLine">locale. Here is the situation: A warden</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a prison is worried because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">large amount of dope finding its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his prison.

One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoners, who makes a practice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">buying up these bags from other in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mates who have no outside markets is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who is the 'dope king.'

I tossed a quarter on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar, started toward the front door.

Read my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind? Was I actually planning on do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it? No, I thought; no, it isn't me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's the liquor.

He looked bored, but waited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaning his elbows on the bar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching me. I poured a stiff drink as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it were a very difficult feat. It wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">so easy at that. My hands were shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that some of the rye slopped over</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bar. I lifted the glass and held it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the light; then, very deliberately, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">inverted it and dumped the lousy stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a gobboon.

He was a tall rangy guy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pronounced stoop and a dark serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. He hadn't changed much in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last ten years. Marriage and a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of kids on a cop's pay had given him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stoop, I guessed. The serious look</seg><seg type="columnLine">had always been there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE WENT out and sat in his car</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the curb.

I'd get back from a three weeks'</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip and find Cora hadn't been exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonesome, if you know what I mean.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not that I was in love with her; not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like I'd been with Fran. But still and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all she was my wife and a guy likes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry his head up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slats went on as though I'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking out loud. "There weren't any</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio jobs ashore and all you could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the chance to nurse a truck around</seg><seg type="columnLine">all day. Only thing was, you weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">making enough dough to please cutie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She kept nagging you about how you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown up with Big Ed, and why didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get him to do something for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gave him a surprised look. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you know that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got eyes," he said, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">profile looked older, more tired. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I couldn't get sore at him. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">using No. 4 sandpaper on me and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">I couldn't get sore. He said, "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">working for Ed, aren't you?" Explain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing quite simply that one and one added</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to two. "Working for Big Ed is also</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad medicine, Jerry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said stubbornly, "It pays some real</seg><seg type="columnLine">dough. And what I'm doing is on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and up as far as the law's concerned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the D.A. says the machines are</seg><seg type="columnLine">games of skill who am I to tell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suckers different?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached forward, wiped fog off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inside of the glass. "All right, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're doing now is maybe not so bad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But how do you know it'll stop there?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once you're in, boy, you're in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nuts," I scoffed. "Ed would be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first one to mitt me if I got out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">racket. The only reason he gave me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">job at all was because of old times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Show me a real job and I'll get out."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned then, grinned at me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Okay, keed, that's a promise. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to Kramer up at C.B.S. I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him how good you were and he said if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were that good--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean a technician's berth at</seg><seg type="columnLine">C.B.S.?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe chief. They're having a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shakeup. Maybe you could talk your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self up better than I did."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I couldn't say anything for a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute. I mean, this guy beside me was real</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. Ed was okay too, of course, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd been thinking about what I'd do</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he ever asked me to step over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. This way, I wouldn't have to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. I could take a brace and maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay Cora off some way and ... I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">go any farther than that. The reason I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't was that Slats had gotten tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">of waiting for me to say thanks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was talking again. About something</seg><seg type="columnLine">PUNK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">else. "I can't get a line on the lug," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was complaining. "You wouldn't hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen to know him, would you, Jerry?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guy by the name of Heinie Ziegler?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt as though he'd just clouted me</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the ear. This guy Ziegler was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be pretty hard to find--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped. He was the mug I'd killed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">month or so back. Thirty-seven days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be exact. You don't forget the date</seg><seg type="columnLine">of things like that. I got a cigarette</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, scratched the match, but somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">I couldn't get the two together. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that my hands were shaking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ziegler?" I coughed. "No, I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I know him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slats reached over, held the match</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady for me. "I'm glad you're off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff, keed. Another week and you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in the D.T. ward out at the County."</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes burned me. I flipped the match</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the window as an excuse to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">away so he couldn't read the fear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been plastered all over my</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't seem to notice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Funny you don't know him," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said musingly. "He used to be one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ed's punks. I went up to see Ed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he said the guy had gone to Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cago, but I think he was lying."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cigarette fell out of my mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I just couldn't help it. Slats McKenna</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't my friend any more. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dick and I was a murderer. He leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and got the cig where it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning a hole in the floor mat, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of quick drags, threw it away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It reminded me of how we used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">share snipes when we were kids south</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tracks. For a second I almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke down and told him the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">works. Then I took a gander at his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knew I couldn't. He was not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tough cop; he was an honest cop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'd crucify me if he knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	twisted the door handle. "Well,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks a million, Slats. I'll go up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Kramer tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better make it tonight, Jerry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These things don't wait. I told Kramer</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd have you on deck if I could find</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay, tonight, then." I was out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sidewalk now, in a hurry. I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to Big Ed and find out what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">happening. "I'll go down and check in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then I'll go see Kramer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Swell," Slats said. "A shower will</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap you out of it, Jerry. Better take</seg><seg type="columnLine">something for that breath, though."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him I'd do that too, and then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slogging toward my own car, lug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging the sack of nickels. That damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">sack was beginning to remind me of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchor, something I couldn't get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from. I laughed at that. Of course I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get awray. Just as I could from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ed Harmon. All I had to do was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop them both. Getting in my car I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surprised to note that it was rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Then I remembered that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been raining all evening. I reached in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door pocket for the spare bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I usually carried, had the cap off</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the neck rattling against my teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I remembered; remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">what fat little Luigi had said, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slats. I hurled the bottle through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrindow. It smashed on the sidewalk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and little rivult of liquor ran down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curb. Somewhere dowrn the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of me, a horn tooted twice. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be Slats, I thought, applauding</seg><seg type="columnLine">me for busting the bottle. I didn't feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">very heroic. I felt like hell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rpHE Title Guarantee Building was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all lit up like a church when I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Usually at that time of night it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pretty quiet, but it must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">tax time or something because every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body connected writh the real estate</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">racket, title searchers and all, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">working late. I'd always gotten a kick</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of Big Ed having his headquarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a building like that. Of course, Ed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the first big shot I'd ever known</seg><seg type="columnLine">personally, but nearly every one 1 re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered reading about transacted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">business from a more or less swanky</seg><seg type="columnLine">night club. It seemed to be the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. Big Ed was different. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">over half of the seventh floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Title Guarantee and the doors that</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't marked "Private" were labeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Harmon Amusement Enterprises,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inc." As far as I knew he didn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">any hideaways, or cafes, or any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual clap-trap. Maybe he had 'em, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 didn't know about 'em. I didn't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rode up in the elevator with four</seg><seg type="columnLine">or five clerks w'ho'd been out for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snack. A couple worked for Ed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they looked at my leather grip and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned. I might have been a collector</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the telephone company, even in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluding the gun in my shoulder clip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only I wasn't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I checked in with the cashier, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a couple semi-private offices</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knocked on Ed's door. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple gorillas sitting there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anteroom, coats off and rods exposed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they didn't pay me a bit of atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Believe it or not, they were play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing checkers. After a minute Ed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self opened the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it's you, Jerry." He was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger than I was, though it wasn't his</seg><seg type="columnLine">size that got him his name. He wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">good clothes as if he were used to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">always had a'gardenia in his lapel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint scent of soap clung to him, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he'd just stepped out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bath. He looked like a senior executive</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a business whose stock was selling</seg><seg type="columnLine">above par. I guess he was, at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said, "Yeah, it's me. Could I talk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to you for a minute, Ed? Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">has come up that . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave me a smile, opened the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">wider. I went in. He came around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down behind his desk. "Okay, Jerry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 told him first about Slats McKenna</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for Heinie Ziegler. "You sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm covered, Ed? Sure somebody hasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">popped off?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed looked at his nails. Like every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else about him they'd had plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the right kind of attention. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a long way since he and 1 and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slats prowled the freight yards for</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrap iron to sell to the junkie. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I ,was embarrassed in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; not like 1 was with Slats. I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's the same as two guys who go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">college together and one of them turns</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to be a success. I hadn't gone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">college, but 1 was the other one, just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same. I didn't blame Fran for picking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed looked at me and for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I noticed how cold his eyes were.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're covered," he said briefly. "Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less you've gotten drunk and belched to</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone yourself. Have you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought about how I'd told Cora,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wife, the night I did it. God, I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to tell someone! 1 was half off my</seg><seg type="columnLine">nut. Not that this Heinie Ziegler hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it coming; in a way it was even</seg><seg type="columnLine">self defense, but there wasn't a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of making a jury believe that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed's voice had a little undertone of</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace in it when he repeated, "Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Jerry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think I'm crazy?" I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "It's bad enough to have you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danville and Skeeter in on it. I'm not</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing any advertising, thank you. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just that McKenna picking me to ask--</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, I got the jitters is all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," he said. And then, giving me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quick, level stare: "What else did</seg><seg type="columnLine">PUNK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you and McKenna talk about? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">were with him quite a while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't get it for a minute. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did and I was sore as a boiled owl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Having me tailed, huh? What's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, afraid I'll knock down a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your lousy nickels ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now don't get red-headed, Jerry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the punks just happened to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Luigi's and phoned me. He thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">you might be in a jam of some kind."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"As if I'm not! And that reminds</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, Ed, I've got a chance to go to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">for C.B.S. I'm checking out on you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went back to studying his nice</seg><seg type="columnLine">nails. "McKenna?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, he's the one got me the break."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And will your wife think it's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">break, Jerry? They tell me that even</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you're making with me isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for Cora."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To hell with her. I'm through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head. "No, Jerry, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't let you do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean you won't? You mean I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't walk out if I want to? The hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that. I'm going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he shook his head. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling, but it didn't mean a thing. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were diamond hard. "Nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">walks out on me, Jerry. Maybe they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried out, but they don't walk. I need</seg><seg type="columnLine">good boys, Jerry; boys I can depend</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. I can depend on you, can't I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You couldn't miss what he meant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You either stuck--or you got stuck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With me, it was just a little murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">rap, of course. Nothing serious. Look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at it from his angle I wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had to be afraid of from me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The answer was nothing. I didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing more than the whole town</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew. He could hire a hundred guys to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do the work I was doing. Well, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why didn't he? Why did he want to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hang onto me? Sort of desperately I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked him. "I wasn't cut out for the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, Ed. I'm just a punk, I guess.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What's it to you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time when he looked at me I</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually shivered. "Punks," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"are useful sometimes, Jerry. Espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially with a rap hanging over them like</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours. And if you ever get the bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea that I could be clipped as an ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessory, just forget it. I couldn't." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat up a little straighter, touched a but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton on his desk. "I think we'll be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get along, Jerry. Now that we un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand each other,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">111HE door opened and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorillas came in. I took my hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from my gun. Yep, for a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd seen the well-known red. I'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the point of letting him have it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sick, actually sick at my stomach, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled towrard the door. Ed's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted me. "Better lay off the liquor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keed. It's bad for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," I said dully. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the fifth guy that's told me to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night." I went out and got in an ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vator and dropped to the lobby. A guy</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at the building directory turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave me a screwy stare. "Did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak to me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I guess I must have been mumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">out loud. I said, "It was two other</seg><seg type="columnLine">guys, mister," and pushed out to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. In the car I reached for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle in the door pocket before I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered that it wasn't there any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. There didn't seem to be any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to do except stop somewhere and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get tanked to the eyes, only I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of any place where there wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be somebody else too and I didn't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see even a bartender for a while. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went home hoping Cora hadn't found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that last pint. She had, though. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">flopped on the davenport in the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">room, too tired to even undress. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while I went to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ringing of the front door bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">woke me. I didn't identify it as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front door bell right off the bat. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been dreaming I was in a broadcast sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion control room, trying to get an</seg><seg type="columnLine">S.O.S. through on account of an earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quake was rapidly making kindling out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our fair city. It was pretty real. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean, I could feel the building tottering</seg><seg type="columnLine">under my feet. But the most vivid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all was Big Ed Harmon holding a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">on me and telling me to lay off; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't want anybody to know there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an earthquake. I kept thinking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They've gotta know. I've gotta tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em," and then I remembered the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm button recessed in the floor. I put</seg><seg type="columnLine">my foot on this and a dozen alarms</seg><seg type="columnLine">started singing so loud it woke me up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dozen alarms turned out to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment bell. Maybe I should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been relieved at that, but I wasn't. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">just lay there for a minute, shivering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering if maybe Big Ed hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed his mind about me. Not about</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting me go, but about making the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parting permanent. Maybe I'd worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, almost pulling my rod like that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe he'd sent a couple of the boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to see that it didn't happen again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bell kept ringing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally I couldn't stand the suspense</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more and got up and went over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. Maybe, I thought, it's just</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cora. She might've forgotten her key.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I jerked my gun out of the clip, twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knob and leaped back. I was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised I couldn't shut my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. It wasn't Cora standing there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It wasn't the couple of hoods I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined. It was Fran. Yep, that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right: Frances Harmon, Big Ed's wife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was as scared as I was. Her big</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes looked enormous in the dead white</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her face, and her dark hair was all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mussed up and wet from the rain. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't have any coat on and her gown</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sopping, what there was left of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somebody had been playing rough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I grabbed her, yanked her inside be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore some of the other tenants could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her in case they got curious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She started sobbing then; not noisily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as if she'd run her heart out. I put</seg><seg type="columnLine">my two arms around her, held her close</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a minute, trying to kid her out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. "It's okay, Fran. I'm here and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how I've always felt about you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Take a brace, keed. Tell papa."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She put her hands on my chest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed me away a little, so that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could look up into my ugly mug. "Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry, I'm sorry if I'm putting you on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spot. I--I just couldn't seem to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anybody else to go to, and I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have any money, or clothes or--" She</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke off and her eyes sort of rolled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her head. "Oh, Jerry, I'm scared!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That makes two of us," I said. 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked her up and carried her over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the couch. "Come on, Fran, tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happened and then I'll see about</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting you some dry clothes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE wiped her mouth with the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her hand. Not like a guy remov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the last of the mashed potatoes, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to stop her lips from quivering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ed just shot and killed a man. I--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where? In his office?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, at home." Home was a pent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house out in Beverly Hills.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">PUNK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">three of them went into the library and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went to bed. Not long after that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard shots. I ran to the library door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">got it open and--and there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">senator on the floor. Ames was stoop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over him, cursing, but it was Ed</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had the gun. It--it was still smok-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I guess I must have screamed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. They turned and Ames started</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursing Ed. Then they both started for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. They caught me in one of the guest</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms and Ames insisted they kill me</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. Ed said that could wait. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">they locked me in and went back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">library, I guess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did you get away?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shivered. "Out the window. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled along a ledge till I got to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire escape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 did a little shivering myself. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the penthouse; knew how it was built</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a corner instead of in the middle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof. Crawling along a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">parapet, in the rain, thirteen stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the street--well, it was no won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der she was jittery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said, "Look, Fran, how much do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know of Big Ed's business besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">this kill ?

About Ed--well, I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard rumors, of course. I read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers. Lately things haven't been go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing so well between us." She gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a direct look. "I--I guess I never loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">him enough to overlook some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things they're saying about him. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's all I know; he's never told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything himself, except to mind my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay," I said, "I'll get you some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cora's clothes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's what you think," Cora said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was standing in her bedroom door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nasty little grin on her face and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">much else on her body. You could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">right through the filmy nightie but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow I didn't get a thrill. I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered how long she'd been there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She told me that, too. "Long enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get the whole picture, you heel."

She brought a hand around, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one she'd been holding behind her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had one of those small pearl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">handled purse-guns in it. I'd dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own rod when I picked up Fran. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt kind of foolish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said, "Now take it easy, Cora.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll work this thing out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're damned right we will, punk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll work it out so it adds up to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">real money.

She got a curious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculative look on her beautiful pan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You had to hand her that much; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly was beautiful.

At another time I'd have tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, at least. But she was all keyed up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot and she had everything on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. I mean, she was my wife; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">our apartment. Fran didn't have many</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes on either and Cora could shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">the both of us and claim we'd violated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sanctity of the home. Probably Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed and this Ames guy would pay her</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bonus for doing the job herself in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of just fingering us. A sweet set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, huh?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said, "Okay, baby, it's your play."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She came out into the room, kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">my rod under a chair. Then, gun held</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost negligently, she gestured us into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coat closet in the hall. The key</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. I'd never noticed it before but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that damned closet door opened in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fran and I were liable to stay put for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The situation wasn't funny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   ORA'S tinkly little laugh, brittle</seg><seg type="columnLine">as glass, came to us. After that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't hear any more until the outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">door closed. In the dark I wrapped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare overcoat around Fran. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivering with the cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said, "Cheer up, kid.

"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know women like that really</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed, Jerry. Do they, or is it all just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bad dream?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," I grated, "it's bad, but it isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dream. Cora is just part of the well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known Cassidy luck. Funny, you com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing here, Fran. I mean, of the million</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a half people in Los Angeles you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to pick Jerry Cassidy and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife." I didn't tell her that she'd run</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one killer straight into the arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of another. There didn't seem to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">any point to making her feel worse than</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did. Well, I thought, I won't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to worry any more about taking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rap for the Heinie Ziegler kill. I'll just</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappear like he did. And like Fran</seg><seg type="columnLine">will.	- r</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frances said, "You think she will try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sell us to Ed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I'm sure of it." I told her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move over out of the way, grabbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorknob with both hands, wedged my</seg><seg type="columnLine">back against the wall and put my feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">up under the knob. You get a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">leverage that way. My luck still held.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The knob came off in my hands. I hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor at the same time the other half</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the knob did, only it had the edge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was on the outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fran flopped down beside me. "Jerry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you hurt ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only my vanity," I told her. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly I chuckled. Not because that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new name for the place that hurt, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I'd just remembered some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Up on the shelf in that closet</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a kit of car tools; the ones I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiped out of the old car when 1 traded</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in. You've probably done that same</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing yourself. It's one of those little</seg><seg type="columnLine">not-quite-honest tricks that goes under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head of good sense. You don't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more allowance for a car with tools</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you do without, so why waste</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em? They say crime don't pay. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if lifting those tools was a crime, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moralists must have slipped because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they sure came in handy. We were out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side in twro minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fran picked out an armload of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cora's clothes, went into the bath. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowded through Cora's vanity, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with two diamond rings I'd given</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and a small roll of bills. You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe get a better idea of Cora when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you there were two C's in that roll.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two hundred dollars, and not three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours ago she'd nicked me for my last</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fran came out. She'd picked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more quiet things: a brown sport suit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown hat and shoes. She looked tired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but like a million to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fran," I said, "I've found a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">stake. Enough to do us for a while if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're careful and stick together. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't make it separately. You ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go with a bum like me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She gave me her hand. "Anywhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry Cassidy. If you're a bum, we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be bums together."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I couldn't say anything to that. I just</seg><seg type="columnLine">took her arm and went out to the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, stooping on the way to get my</seg><seg type="columnLine">PUNK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rod from under the chair. We went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to my car. It had stopped raining</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I thought that might be a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      WERE about half way down</seg><seg type="columnLine">' ' the first block when I happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look in the rear vision mirror. A car</seg><seg type="columnLine">without lights had just pulled up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the apartment. A couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">guys got out, started inside. Then one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them half turned, looked down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street and spotted my tail-light. Any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, I guess that's what made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave his arm in my direction. The car</seg><seg type="columnLine">without lights got under way. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all 1 waited to see. I romped on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">accelerator till the Chewy thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a super-charged vibrator. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced around the first corner on two</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels, straightened out from a skid</seg><seg type="columnLine">that almost smashed us against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curb, reversed at the next turn and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all over again. We were probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">making about fifty but it seemed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fran was on her knees, looking out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear window and cheering me on</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it was a race of high school kids at</seg><seg type="columnLine">three in the afternoon. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little pinggg and a slug cut through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window and smashed the mirror. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, I thought, you're asking for it. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled at Fran : "Get down on the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nit-wit! We're gonna play games too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scenery, consisting mostly of</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened store-fronts, was going by us</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile a minute; the street was still as</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet as the bottom of the ocean, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">slicker. Fran was down on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, saying little prayers, and I hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chewy's body was as good as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ads said. I didn't slam on the brakes. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afraid to on that greasy pavement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It wasn't necessary, anyway. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail of my eye I saw the emblem on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other car's nose creep up, then part of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the hood. All I did was take my foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the throttle. You'd think we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped dead. I put two quick slugs in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an open window as the other job leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, not knowing how many guys</seg><seg type="columnLine">were inside, not caring. The big car</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a full length up on us before it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrent into a kind of tail spin. It skidded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the width of the street, bounced back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the center, started whirling. Round</seg><seg type="columnLine">and round it went and I knew its brakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were locked. I was half around in a U</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn by this time. Somebody in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning car took a shot at us, missed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the machine he was in suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit acting like a dizzy ballet dancer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went flying off at a tangent. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">last I saw of it was when it crashed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light pole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I straightened out in the opposite di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection and began fanning the air in</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest. The main reason was a prowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">car's siren. I didn't want to meet any</seg><seg type="columnLine">cops till I'd had time to stash Frances</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a safe place. Maybe not even then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What with Big Ed being on familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms with State Senators and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing and another, I had no assurance</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd be any safer in jail. This guy Ames</seg><seg type="columnLine">had me kind of worried too. I mean, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought his name had a familiar sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it, but I couldn't seem to place it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fran had said he'd cursed Ed. Any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body big enough to curse Ed must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no small potatoes. Maybe he's lieuten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant-governor or something, I thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyway, between the two of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were pretty sure to swing a mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">drag politically; enough to see that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">punk named Jerry Cassidy didn't talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wrong cops. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I left the car in an alley and Fran</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I walked the two blocks to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hotel Mercer.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">let that ride because there was no use</seg><seg type="columnLine">kidding her. After a while she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jerry, would you mind kissing me?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just once?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't any chore. I kissed her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then straightened and stood looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at her. "Why did you want me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do that ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," she admitted. "I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">just thought it might be a good idea."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She got up, took her--or rather Cora's</seg><seg type="columnLine">--hat and coat and went to the connect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing door. "I'm going to lie down for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while, Jerry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But look," I said, "hey, you just</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed you wanted to stay in here</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," she nodded. And then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We gals are funny, Jerry. You'll find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that out some day." The door closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I just stood there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOMEBODY knocked on the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and I thought it was the hop</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming back with the cigarettes. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">on in," I said. The door opened quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was Detective-Sergeant Slats</seg><seg type="columnLine">McKenna, as big as life and just about</seg><seg type="columnLine">as unpleasant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To give you some idea of how un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant he really intended to be, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his gun out in plain sight. His lean</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark face was drawn, tired-looking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the dow7n-drooping mouth was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than just tired; it was cynical.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes looked like two burned holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a navy blanket. He shut the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly behind him, stood leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Jerry," he said, "we do find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out things about people, don't we ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why'd you do it? I mean, why did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have to do it that way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why did I do what?" I sparred. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, of course. Somehow the guy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out about the Heinie Ziegler</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill. "And what do you mean by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way? What difference does it make?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gave me a screwy look. "So you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do know what I'm talking about! I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of hoped you wouldn't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, I'd certainly left myself open</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that one. That's the trouble with</seg><seg type="columnLine">cops and a guilty conscience. They ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">you two questions at once and you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">PUNK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•so busy trying to evade one that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip on the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said, "All right, Jerry, turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. Slowly, now. I don't want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to hurt you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," I said, "I can see that. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want to do is have my neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched about a yard." I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, though, and he came up behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, reached around and got my gun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was sniffing it when I looked at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Like a bloodhound. I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite figure this out. 1 mean, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been thirty-seven days since I'd blasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ziegler and even a punk as dumb as me</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be expected to carry a dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun all that time. Besides, it wasn't the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same gun. Big Ed had gotten me a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Then I remembered that I'd just</seg><seg type="columnLine">got through using the rod on the hoods</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were chasing us. Maybe, I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he don't know about Ziegler. Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm being picked up for this other</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said, "Now wait a minute, Slats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">.Maybe I can explain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't have to," he said tiredly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's all quite clear. Cora caught you</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheating with this other dame and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">let her have it." He dropped my heater</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his pocket. He could have made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanish in thin air and I wouldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been surprised. I was numb from head</seg><seg type="columnLine">to foot already. I was supposed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed my wife!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Funny,'huh? I'd reallv killed Ziegler.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd more than likely killed a hood or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two in that car. But was I wanted for</seg><seg type="columnLine">either of those things? No, indeed. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was being arrested for murdering</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cora. It was to laugh--if you felt like</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing. Me, I didn't. My brain sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly unlocked. Slats was saying: "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew you hated her, Jerry. Everybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it. And you had plenty cause. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do it over another woman--to just</seg><seg type="columnLine">toss her out in the gutter like that--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">well, you never seemed like that kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a guy, is all. Who is this dame pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as your sister?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried not to look at Fran's door. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was closed a little while ago, I knew. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped it still was; hoped she wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting a load of this. Oh, I know; it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks quite simple on the surface. All I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to do was get Fran to tell Slats it</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't have been me who let Cora</seg><seg type="columnLine">have it. She'd say, "Why, Big Ed did</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, of course! Right after he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">through killing Senator Delgardo!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only thing was, Slats wouldn't be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve it. There was the old record of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fran and I going together back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days when we were all kids. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">my known hatred for Cora, and my hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. Ballistics, of course, could prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it wasn't the gun that had done for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cora, but at the moment I was all out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ballistics experts. Slats would nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urally think Fran was trying to cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and not doing a very good job of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. He'd say, "Okay, you can come</seg><seg type="columnLine">along too, Fran." Suppose he did that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suppose we all went down to Head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters. By this time Big Ed and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ames party would thoughtfully have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten rid of Delgardo's body. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be any proof. They'd think</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fran was lying, and let Big Ed spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Once sprung, it didn't take a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid imagination to picture what</seg><seg type="columnLine">would happen to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wet my lips. "Look, Slats, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">come you found me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave me a sour grin. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">found Cora first. After that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a general alarm out for you. A prowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">car located your car in an alley near</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and it had a bullet hole in it--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have missed Cora with that one--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so they sent me out because I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">describe you better than most. Funny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">huh?" He wasn't liking this much bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter than I was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I said yes, it certainly was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny. All the time I kept wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to do about Fran. If I didn't drag</seg><seg type="columnLine">her into it, let Slats think she'd lammed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then what? Why, then he'd grab me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she'd be left alone. With a general</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm out, he couldn't keep the pinch</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet. Big Ed, knowing Fran had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me, would send a batch of hoods</seg><seg type="columnLine">after her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I almost went down on my knees to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guy. "Slats," I jittered, "I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill Cora. She had it coming, and I ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit I'm not so awfully sorry, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't kill her. I sw7ear it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His dark eyes said I was a snivelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">heel. "Who else would want to, punk?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WELL, I'd look cute telling him</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ed had done it. I wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">even sure he had. He'd probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered it done and had an unbreak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able alibi. Maybe I wasn't thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight; maybe you can figure what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should have done. All I'm telling you</seg><seg type="columnLine">is what I did. I took a chance on Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kenna's gun, came out of a sort of half</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouch and hung a hard right on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern jaw. His head snapped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the hall door. After that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">just kind of folded up in sections, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little at a time, till he was sprawled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat. All but his head. That still leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the door. I wondered if I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken his neck, got down on my knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him. His neck was all right. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fran's door opened and she popped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, gave a little screech. "Oh, Jerry, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dead?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," I said. "Better get your coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hat, Fran. We've gotta go places</seg><seg type="columnLine">before your dear husband hears where</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are." I was going through Slats'</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets now, after my gun. Believe it</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not, the guy had a big hole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket he'd dropped my rod in. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">damn thing had slid way down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lining. I let it go, grabbed his own gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clipped it under my arm as Fran came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. Together we went out and caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">a down elevator. The lobby of the Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cer was L-shaped, the elevator bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the turn from the desk. Fran</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 1 got to the turn just as the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk glanced in that direction. I saw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth flop open, saw the movement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body as his toe reached for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm button under the desk. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">step on it, just waited to see if Slats</seg><seg type="columnLine">McKenna was behind us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I grabbed Fran's arm, pulled her</seg><seg type="columnLine">back out of sight. My left hand located</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roll of dough, pressed it into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist. The elevator operator was watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing us now. I said, "Here, kid, don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop to argue. You've got clothes now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and money. Beat it out the back way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">go down the alley and snag a cab on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fifth. Go to the Palais in Hollywood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wait for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head. "Jerry, I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave you like this. You're in trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some kind. Besides me, I mean. I--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard part of what Slats said. I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You might," I agreed. "If you lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough." I put on the old act here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's really for my sake, Fran. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds like Ed and this guy Ames</seg><seg type="columnLine">might swing a lotta weight. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want you picked up by either Ed or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cops till I know just where we stand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In other words you'll do me more good</seg><seg type="columnLine">at present if nobody knows where you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are." A fat house dick waddled around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ell, looking important. I gave Fran</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shove toward the service entrance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripped the fat guy as he went by. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">started yelling bloody murder. So did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kid in the elevator. I took it on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lam out past the desk. The clerk had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. He shut his eyes as he pulled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger and naturally you can't expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">PUNK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to hit much with your eyes closed. AH</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hit was one of the big plate-glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows and this went out with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">booming crash just as I made the side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk. Slats McKenna's police job was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the curb; there was not a cab in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. I scrambled into Slats' car. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-known Cassidy luck was still with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Slats had taken his keys with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clerk and the operator and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat house dick were all stuck in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolving door. T crawled out the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the car just as another car</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung into the street. Two men got</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, slanted toward me, not running,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a couple of jay walkers headed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel. The car came on. I swiveled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran smack into a second car. This one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was without lights, coming from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other direction. I hadn't even heard it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I went to my hands and knees from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impact, the brakes locked. Two guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">started a sort of rhythmic one-two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-two blasting and from the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling glass I guessed they were shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the revolving door of the Mercer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had Slats' rod out when the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">nudged me again, not hard, just enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to knock me sprawling without exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">running over me. Somebody stepped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hand. .Somebody else kicked me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head. Then both somebodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached down and hauled me to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Going some place, Cassidy? We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">give you a lift." This polite offer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed by a swing that practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked my head right off and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only vaguely conscious of being shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a car. Motor sound drummed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ears. Presently that too faded out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Y AND by 1 got the idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody was shaking me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening my eyes I discovered that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the first Jerry Cassidy idea that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had panned out all evening. The guy</seg><seg type="columnLine">really was shaking me. I was still in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car, in the back seat, and the guy</seg><seg type="columnLine">working me over had an assistant. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sandwiched between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up front, under the wheel, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">third guy who was paying strict atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to his driving. We must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles away from the Mercer Hotel. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped Frances was too. The guy shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me found out that I was awake and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapped his knuckles against my teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other one said, "Hey, cut that</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. You been working for ten minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">tryin' to get him awake and the minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do you wanna slap him back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. Where's the percentage ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My pal," I thanked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yeah?" he said, and smacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me himself. He was nothing but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypocrite, that guy. He took out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife and flipped open a four inch blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tested the edge on his thumb. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched that knife with a great deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of interest, wondering which part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me he was going to try it on first. First</seg><seg type="columnLine">my stomach got goose pimples, then my</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. He fooled me. He jabbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point into my knee. "Where's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dame?" he wanted to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What dame?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jab went the knife again. This time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my ribs. He must have measured off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exact distance because it didn't go</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the ribs. He pretended it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corkscrew, taking it out. The other guy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had an arm under my chin. That's all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that kept me from yelling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guy with the knife wiped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade fastidiously on the back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front seat. "All right, Percy, leave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk." He had a face like a wedge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Percy took his arm away and I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk. You learn a lot of nice words</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the navy. I gave them the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">works in one breath. Percy got hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of my flailing arms, shoved it up</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">between my shoulder blades. "Shut up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">punk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shut up. The guy with the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">licked his lips. He reminded me more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more of a hyena I'd seen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zoo when I was a kid. This hyena had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been watching a keeper with a chunk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat, and it was a toss-up which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted most: the keeper or the meat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatchet-face made up his mind on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exact spot he was going to carve next.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned a little more in the seat, got</seg><seg type="columnLine">my right ear between a thumb and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger and sliced off a little piece of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lobe. I let him have my right fist in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kidney. Percy snapped my left arm. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have no recollection of being taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the car or going up in the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vator or anything. The first I remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">was waking up in a chair in front of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big desk, and on the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk was Big Ed Harmon. My broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">left arm was swollen tight inside my</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat sleeve and shooting flaming arrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pain clear out the top of my head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed's face would loom up big as a house</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a minute, then fade out till you</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't see anything but the eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Percy and Hatchet-face wrere telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">him all about it.

Not until then had</seg><seg type="columnLine">I associated the name with the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. The reason, of course, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that probably there weren't more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half dozen people in the whole town</seg><seg type="columnLine">who called him Ames. He was A. H.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hutchins to the papers and the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">at large. He owned the Title Guarantee</seg><seg type="columnLine">Building; the one where Big Ed had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his offices. He was chairman of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">State Central Committee, on the boards</seg><seg type="columnLine">of most of the banks, an honorary po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lice commissioner and a lot of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things I was too busy to think of. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had nice curly white hair and one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those skins you love to touch. Boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would I have loved to touch it! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers of my right hand started jerk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing I wanted to get at him so bad. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand didn't do much of anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">except hurt like hell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS Hutchins guy was the first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice I was awake. He said, "Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">rid of these--these men." Meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">Percy and Hatchet-face. Ed told them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get the hell out. I got the impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they didn't really know what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all about. All they'd been told was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get me and the gal that was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. The short wave had given Ed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general locality of where I might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">holed up and he'd sent out a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars to patrol the neighborhood. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cops didn't know the gal was Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed's wife, though.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got up as soon as the two mugs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone, came around the desk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held a glass to my lips. I drank. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">room stopped going round and round.</seg><seg type="columnLine">PUNK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">79</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed sat on the edge of the desk, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot on the floor, the other swinging.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 remember he was wearing spats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where is she, Jerry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gave him a grin. "In China, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached down, quite casually, got</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of my broken arm and twisted it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You could hear the bones grating. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went off my nut for a minute, tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kick him. It was then I discovered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ankles were tied to the front legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chair I was in. "Where is she,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I screamed then. I couldn't help it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But screaming or not I stuck to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">story. "She's in China!" I yelled. "In</seg><seg type="columnLine">China, China, China, you hear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hutchins said, "Stop it, Harmon! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't stand it!" As if Big Ed had hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his arm. I wanted to laugh at that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but somehow all I could do was sob.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And here I'd been thinking I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough guy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed let go my arm, held the glass to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mouth again. I slobbered all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Then 1 remembered I had two arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to. paste him one with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. He just pushed it down as if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a baby. "Did you tell Slats Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kenna anything?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he knew about Slats being there</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. I choked on the last swallow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure," I gasped. "Fran and I told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the w'hole works. He oughta be along</seg><seg type="columnLine">most any minute now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Hutchins said, "Great Scott!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed just laughed at him. "Imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">me working for you all these years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, you're a weak sister, Ames, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought you were a big shot. I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have guessed when you went haywire</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shot Delgardo. Well, we'll have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">show-down after we get this thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened out. Maybe you'll be work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Hutchins groaned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed said, "Don't worry, the punk</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't tell McKenna anything. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">bopped the dick and lammed. All we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to do is find Frances and then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can wash the whole thing up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The telephone rang. Ed swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, answered it. "Okay," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"bring her right up." I almost passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Something told me the "her" they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bringing up was Frances. Des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately I got the kinks out of my neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and really looked around. We were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the living room of the Beverly Hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">penthouse. I hadn't known it before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened and two guys car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried Frances in. They must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought her up in the freight elevator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even the dumbest clerk on earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have passed them like that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her feet and hands were taped very</seg><seg type="columnLine">neatly and there were two strips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">adhesive crossed over her lips. X mark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the spot, 1 thought. The spot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed will kick her teeth in. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it right away, though. He just</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked his big, good-looking head</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward a fireside divan and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">lugs dumped her on it. Her eyes met</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine with a sort of horrified surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I guess I didn't make a very pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture. I could feel the smear of dried</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood on my cheek where the guy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">operated on my ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two guys looked kind of like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ones that had got out of the car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in front of the Mercer. I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure because it had been pretty dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the street at the time and I'd had</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two other things on my mind. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't see that it made much differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence anyway. Neither Frances nor I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going to do any identifying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed said quietly, "You have any</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A little," one guy admitted. "She'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">already gotten a cab and was on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">way by the time we found out all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">angles. We had to wait for the cab to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back. Then it was duck soup. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palais is a nice dump," he added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll make a note of that," Ed said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mr. Hutchins, over by the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows, cursed him irritably. "Let's get</seg><seg type="columnLine">this over with, Harmon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed said, "Sure, Ames, sure. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to take care of it personally?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Hutchins turned green and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like he was going to be sick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hell, man, no! How can you be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">callous?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," Ed said, "after all, it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">I who killed--" He broke off as Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hutchins lifted a shaking hand. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling a little as at some secret joke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "Excuse it, please," and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two mugs to scram. They went out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That left only him and Mr. Hutchins</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Fran and me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HUTCHINS said accusingly, "See</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, Harmon, it's true I shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senator Delgardo, but it was in a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of panic. I'm not a cold-blooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"No? Then what would you suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">we do with this pair of tramps--give</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em our blessing and turn 'em loose?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Couldn't--couldn't you have your</seg><seg type="columnLine">men . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed gave him a hard little laugh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen, lame-brain, you and I are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this together. It doesn't make any dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference to the police who actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled the trigger on Delgardo. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">my gun and it's my penthouse. Nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the four of us here even knows the</seg><seg type="columnLine">senator is dead. We'll just keep it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and after a while there'll only be</seg><seg type="columnLine">two who know. You and I will take</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The telephone buzzed again. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be Big Ed's busy night. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked it up, listened a moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time I actually saw emo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion register on his face. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared. Then he slammed the phone</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, whirled on Mr. Hutchins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Okay, punk, we'll have to make this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. A flatfoot named McKenna is on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't--can't you have him stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">downstairs ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," Ed said. "Sure I can but I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">not going to. Now don't go off your</seg><seg type="columnLine">nut. Just give me a lift with the punk's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They lifted me, chair and all, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried me over to what looked like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid-paneled wall. I couldn't see how</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed worked it but the wall opened, up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was a cute little room behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It was already occupied. Yep, that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. Senator Delgardo was lying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a leather couch with a very pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Afghan pulled up to his chin and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of utter peace on his face. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body had very thoughtfully closed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes for him. I wondered if I'd look</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nice--afterward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed had a roll of adhesive. He slapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strip of it around my right arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinning it to the chair. I tried to bite</seg><seg type="columnLine">him when he tackled my mouth but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no go. That got taped too. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and got Fran and tossed her care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly on the floor beside the senator's</seg><seg type="columnLine">couch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, appraisingly, he looked at Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hutchins. "You'd better stay in here</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, baby. You're too hysterical for</seg><seg type="columnLine">McKenna. You'd make him nervous."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I want a gun," the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">babbled. "I want a gun in case any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing happens. I won't be taken alive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tell you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you don't shut up," Ed said, "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">take you myself." He went back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big room and got a gun though.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tossed this through the panel, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone to a whining pup. The panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5 D--19</seg><seg type="columnLine">PUNK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">81</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little room wasn't soundproof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You could hear Ed moving around out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, straightening things. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an awfully long time before some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body opened the hall door and said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lieutenant McKenna, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed said, "Hello, Slats," in a careless</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice and there was a faint rustle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers. I could imagine him sitting at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his desk, very preoccupied with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. "What's new with you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Same old sixes and sevens," Slats</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Nothing startling except I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">that heel Cassidy. You knew he mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered his wife, didn't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed said yes, he'd heard about it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the radio. "Too bad about Jerry. I kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling him to lay off the liquor, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know how some of these guys are.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Have a slug yourself, Slats?" There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a tinkle of glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slats said, "No. No, thanks, I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bad liver and I have to watch it." I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could picture him walking around</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously while Ed drank. Slats never</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stay still very long. Presently he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went off at a tangent. "What time did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senator Delgardo go home?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought Mr. Hutchins was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to faint. His eyes rolled up in his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he leaned weakly against the panel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasping. If it hadn't been for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned chair I'd have tackled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. Even bound I could have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">something happen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed, taking his time, answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question. "About eleven, I think.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I just wondered. Did he take his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair with him? There's one missing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can see the leg marks in the rug and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there don't seem to be another chair in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room that would fit. Maybe you</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him a present of it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a hell of a long pause this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Finally Big Ed said with a trace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of irritation: "What's on your mind,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">6	D--19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">McKenna? I paid for the chair. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did with it is none of your business</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I don't mind telling you some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body burned a hole in the fabric and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it taken out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," Slats said, "I hope there</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't somebody tied in it at the time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I mean the hole might have been burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the party first, huh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TT WAS very quiet for a minute; so</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet I thought Slats might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone and I got jittery. Trying to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the chair I overturned it instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell on my face, skidding smack</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Hutchins. Well, he'd heard every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I had and was pretty jittery to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start with. He fell down on top of me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the gun went boom-boom-boom</seg><seg type="columnLine">right in my ear. Like an echo another</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun blasted out in the living room, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">this one did it just once. That was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a signal touching off a whole string of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannon crackers down in Chinatown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe it was because I had my ear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor that it sounded so plain; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting wasn't going on in the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. It was farther away than that. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to scrooge around to see what Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hutchins was doing all this time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the wall panel opened and Slats</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bent down and took the gun out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mr. Hutchins' fist. Mr. Hutchins</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't seem to mind a bit. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">look quite as peaceful as State Senator</seg><seg type="columnLine">Delgardo but he was just as dead. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">last of those three slugs he'd fired had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone in his mouth. Maybe he'd done it</seg><seg type="columnLine">on purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slats still didn't say anything. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">righted my chair, went over and untied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frances. There was a lot of noise out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the living room now. Sounded like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marines had landed. A harness bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sergeant's stripes came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel and said, "All clear, Lieutenant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">82</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DETECTIVE FICTION WEEKLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ed's awake if you want to talk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slats nodded gloomily. His lantern</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw needed a shave and his dark eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had pouches under them. Fran got</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffly to her knees, clumped over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my side. "Oh, Jerry, what have they</seg><seg type="columnLine">been doing to you?" She fumbled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the adhesive on my mouth. It hurt so</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad coming off I forgot about my</seg><seg type="columnLine">busted arm for a minute. Slats seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come to some kind of a decision and</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped Fran get me out of the chair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I tried to stand up I fell flat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my face again. A couple of cops came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in at that and picked me up and carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">me out to the divan by the fireplace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slats looked down at me threaten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly. "You wanna drink?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did. But all I did was give him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin that he mistook for a sneer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, "Nuts, I'm off it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sneered right back at me. "Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yeah?" He turned away to answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody's question, turned back after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute and said carelessly, "By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, you didn't kill your wife with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gun. We checked."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frances, kneeling beside me, gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him an indignant, "Of course he didn't!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could have told you that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slats said, "He did a pretty good</seg><seg type="columnLine">job on Heinie Ziegler, though."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 nearly passed out. Well, I'd been</seg><seg type="columnLine">expecting it and here it was. I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakly, "How--how did you know?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your gun, sappo, your gun.

Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was just looking at his face, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fran; maybe it was my broken arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made my vision get kind of fuzzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of a sudden. Somehow I got a hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerchief out and blew my nose and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded just like a foghorn at sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everybody in the room turned to stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me resentfully. Even Big Ed Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon who was cuffed to his chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">submitting to an interne's cursed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structions. Apparently all that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong with Big Ed was a creased scalp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slats said, keeping his voice low, "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hadn't been such a punk you'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelled the frame, Jerry. It's the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">gag, pinning a trick kill on a new re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruit so he won't squawk when lie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">really told to do something. Only some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times it's a real kill and that's what 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afraid of. That's why I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to break out of the racket before</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was too late." He reached down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched Fran's head lightly. "I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a job, kid. Not much dough in it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it's the right kind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I COULDN'T see why he was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaining this to her. They seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have something in common that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know about. I said, "Okay, okay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm a punk and I don't know which end</seg><seg type="columnLine">is up. So maybe you'll tell me how you</seg><seg type="columnLine">got wise to so much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," he said. "I was up here</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier in the evening looking for Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed to ask him about Heinie Ziegler.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We got a pick-up order from St. Louis</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Heinie. An old rap. Well, Ed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still at the office but I saw Senator Del-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardo who was waiting. That's how I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew he'd been here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">PUNK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then we found your wife, and try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to find you we found where some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body had busted out of your hall closet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I figured that might have been Cora at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first. Later on the boys bring in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked car and a dead guy named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ziegler who I knew used to work for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ed. You were also working for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ed. And when I finally woke up</seg><seg type="columnLine">after you bopped me there in the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">--well, I got curious about this sister</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yours and got a pretty fair de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scription of Frances, Ed's wife. It all</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to tie into Ed, see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kind of," I admitted. The interne</seg><seg type="columnLine">was working on my busted arm now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I wasn't feeling so hot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," Slats went on, "Ballistics</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported that your slug hadn't killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">your wife, but that it had done for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heinie Ziegler. I couldn't, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that it was Heinie you thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd killed before. I just figured it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a similar frame on account of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't gone to see Kramer at C.B.S.</seg><seg type="columnLine">like you promised. Again it sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Big Ed's work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then there was the battle in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Mercer. The clerk and the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">dick said you'd been snatched. I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered what had happened to Fran--if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was Fran. It stood to reason that</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of you knew something big;</seg><seg type="columnLine">something Big Ed didn't want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread, and that reminded me of Sena-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor Delgardo who I'd seen here. Any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, it was a fair guess that somebody</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make a try for the gal, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">just waited around till a couple of guys</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">started asking questions of a cabby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I followed the two guys out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Palais and there you are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like hell I am!" I snorted. "Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">did kill Cora, and why'd you let those</seg><seg type="columnLine">mugs grab Fran?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got the boys that killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cora," he said quietly. "She came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Ed with the news that she had you</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked up in that closet. She wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. He paid her off by sending her</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with Heinie Ziegler's crew and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they just dumped her on the way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About Fran: I didn't have a damn</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing but guesses so far. I figured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two mugs would take Fran to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were, and if I couldn't do any bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter I'd hand Big Ed a kidnap rap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I grunted. "Well," I said, "I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 helped some. I sort of helped wreck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Hutchins anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If he didn't commit suicide," Slats</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneered. "The only thing I can think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you're good for is for really tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">guys to practice on. Just a punk at</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fran said indignantly, "He is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">such thing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slats grinned then, shook his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, you're entitled to your opinion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When you're finally free of Big Ed</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe you can explain the answers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the punk.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow up on the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, in the auditorium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as handsome as a matinee idol.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mangasarius, he called himself.

What he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said didn't have to make sense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had a good racket, if it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">racket. Free lectures, like this, several</seg><seg type="columnLine">mornings a week. Just enough to lure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mangasarius knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answers to all prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lems--except his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">             them into special courses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lectures, for small</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups, at a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucks a course; and pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vate lessons, at still</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher fees. Besides that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he collected anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">they wanted to give--</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, stocks and bonds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">property, jewels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That's why I was here. Mrs. Rufus</seg><seg type="columnLine">G. Hyde was about to give Mangasari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">us something, and Rufus objected. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know what to do about it, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hired me to watch her and Man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasarius. If she handed him a necklace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bunch of securities, or a wad of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dough, I was to try to get the goods</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him, evidence that would show he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had unduly influenced her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tough job, but Rufus was paying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bills. Rufus had plenty of the root</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all evil; he could afford to let his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife shell out to a grifter, if Mangy</seg><seg type="columnLine">--as I got to calling him--was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MIRACLE MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grifter. But Rufus hated to see the jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had taken away from people dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Mangy's hand. Rufus hated to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">out-smarted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mangy spread his hands in a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture. "Let us not pray, dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends," he said in that dulcet voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Rather, let us pause for a meditative</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. Let us look inward. Let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">tap that reservoir of power, that well</seg><seg type="columnLine">of spirit, that dwells within our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a moment's silence. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gestured finally and walked briskly</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the platform. Immediately, a beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful girl in a white dress came out. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Mangy's niece and co-worker, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. She went into a crisp, busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesslike number. Mangy's book was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">sale in the lobby; they'd better buy it or</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd never know happiness. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only four dollars. And for those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to take Mangy's special course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lectures, the line formed on the left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For private lessons in the Miracle Way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was what Mangy modestly called</seg><seg type="columnLine">his method, they'd have to see her, Do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lores, the niece, and pony up. She an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced other lectures. She was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, clever baggage, but she didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have Mangy's velvet flow. But she sold</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was watching Mrs. Rufus G. Hyde.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was a little woman, and she must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been very pretty once. Now you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that she was desperately try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to hang on to her youth. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been through the mill--diet, facials,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair dyes, massage and all the rest. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked worked over. She had a kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of silly look on her face, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was probably only one idea in her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to try to stay young and beautiful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was getting on to fifty, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to take, because she had the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she should always be a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-year-old. She had nerves. She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fidgeted. But Mangy was her hope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could give her everlasting youth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as no one else could. He had even im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied that his dope would conquer</seg><seg type="columnLine">death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I chewed my gum and looked at her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also, at the girl beside her. Her social</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary, a sweet blonde package</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Irene. The blonde wasn't fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for Mangy's line. She didn't need</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--yet. She had youth and beauty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">allure. When Mangy's dark, beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">niece, Dolores, went into the sales song</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dance, Irene smiled cynically. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the ropes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE meeting was breaking up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">People moving around. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dames had a glow in their eyes. Mangy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given them something, whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was. Faith, hope, but no charity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My job was to follow Mrs. Rufus. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. But my eyes were on Irene. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have had my vote in any beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">contest--bathing beauty, especially.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl had everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Rufus was heading for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall, back-stage, that led to Mangy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">office here in the auditorium. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he gave his small group lectures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Private lessons were dished out at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, a big old place on a knoll over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking a lake on the edge of town. Do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lores, the niece, lived there, too. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few servants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolores met Mrs. Rufus and greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her warmly, cordially. They were go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to collect. For Irene, she had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">an icy nod, a cool "How do you do?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">No soap from Irene, and she probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the secretary was trying to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old dame from tossing baubles into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mangy's kitty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Darling," Mrs. Rufus gushed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolores, "tell the dear master that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have arranged it.

Dolores led her to the door that</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened into the suite of offices. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">another girl at a typewriter as the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened. She got up, at a word from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolores, and led Mrs. Rufus on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear master's private office. Well, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't going to see what she gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, or hear what she had arranged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I moved up next to Irene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great stuff, isn't it?" I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She froze me, but said, "What?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Miracle Way," I said. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">master, Mangasarious."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excuse me," she said, and hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the mob to a tall, quick-mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing young fellow in gray tweeds who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going towards the master's office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She joined him and they went on to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. Just before they entered the of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fic, she looked back over her shoulder. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been staring at her, but I wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. I was telling the fussy old woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">next to me that it was great stuff. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was agreeing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went into the office. The typist</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't at her desk. Then the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I missed Dolores in the crowd, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes. Then I heard her talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to a woman near me. She had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere and had come back. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was telling the woman, who wore ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pensive clothes and some real jewelry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Mangy would see her soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Dolores moved off toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. But she didn't go in. She went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another door and entered that. Her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">private office, I guessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Irene, Mrs. Rufus, and the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow in tweeds came out of the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe ten minutes later. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud scream and the girl I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the typewriter ran after them, point-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her finger, crying "They killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T CRASHED through the mob and</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to the door. Dolores ran out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her room and started asking excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions. She called to somebody to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear the hall. Mrs. Rufus looked dazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and happy. Irene looked mad. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">young fellow, holding both women by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arm, looked silly and surprised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The typist was still yelling, "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed him!" And the women of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience didn't want to be shoved out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If it was their dear master the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">was yelling about, they wanted to lynch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three who had just left him.

The knife must have gone right</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his heart. I gave his office the once-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, standing in the door so I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch the others. The typist was sob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing; maybe she liked Mangy, or may-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be she wondered where she'd get an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other job. The look of goofy happiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the face of Mrs. Rufus had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed; now she looked stricken, gray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathetic. Irene was downright mad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The young fellow still looked silly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a coat closet at one side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door partly open. The office was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground floor, with large windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a court. They were closed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole place was furnished like a movie</seg><seg type="columnLine">set--a six-inch carpet, chairs uphol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stered in velvet, heavy drapes at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows, swell pictures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Opposite the coat closet was another</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, closed. I took a chance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed to it. The door was unlocked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It led into a simply furnished office</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a desk, a typewriter, a dictaphone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a filing cabinet. This was where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolores wyorked--the room she had en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered from outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were all sitting there when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back. But the young fellow had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been leaning over to whisper to Irene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Kelly started hammering on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and I let him .in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some day," he growled, "you'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corpse at one of these killings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who's dead and why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS gang got to work in Mangy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. Kelly started questioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others. According to the typist, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three--Mrs. Rufus, Irene and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young fellow7--had come out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. She had heard the young fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, "That's that!" She had gone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mangy's door, to give him some let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters to sign, and had seen him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knife in his back. She had run</seg><seg type="columnLine">out after the others, accusing them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young fellow was the nephew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mrs. Rufus--Ronald Darrow. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Irene admitted they had followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Rufus into Mangy's office, hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dissuade her from giving him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">necklace worth ten grand, hoping to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scare Mangy into refusing it. Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rufus would not be dissuaded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mangy wouldn't be scared. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been smooth and hypocritical; he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he could not reject the free-will</seg><seg type="columnLine">offerings of his devoted followers, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to help him w'ith his great work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you threaten him?"

She was still angry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Rufus couldn't talk much. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dazed.

But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't there now; or anywhere else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went out to a phone booth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Rufus. He exploded, when I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him what had happened, and said he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">come right down. I met him outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his big car slid up to the curb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rufus was a handsome, gray-haired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pink-faced old boy; gruff and surly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface, but with a hearty laugh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He put away plenty of good food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquor, and he had an eye for a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. He grabbed my arm and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussing; he cussed like a longshore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Then we went in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put his arm protectingly around</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife, nodded to Irene and Ronald,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared at Kelly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He suggested to Kelly that they all</seg><seg type="columnLine">be allowed to leave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah?" said Kelly. "Where were</seg><seg type="columnLine">you when this guy was stabbed?

With all of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mangy's followers in town, it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swell story. In spite of Rufus' objec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, they shot pictures all over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolores, sitting by herself in a cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, was a perfect picture of a grief-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken niece.

Now--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kelly cut in with an announcement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm holding you, Darrow," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"on suspicion.

Two bulls grabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, then. Rufus protested, but it didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do any good. There was nothing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do. Irene put her arms around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ronald, kissed him, whispered some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to him. Then Rufus shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and said he'd send his lawyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, get him out quick. I went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the car with Rufus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you were any good on your job,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MIRACLE MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Burke," he snapped at me, "you'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevented this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah," I said.

"Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irene. So it's no concern of mine."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Okay. Then I quit, huh? No con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cern of mine, either. But if you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kelly can't build a case against Ronald,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're wrong. Somebody has to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried and convicted.

But they're your friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not mine." I shrugged and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait, Burke!" he protested. "Stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Murder cases come higher, boss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From now on the ante is raised.

He was ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">A tioning Dolores, pretty gently, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. I grinned to myself. I was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one who knew she had had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance at Mangy. There'd probably be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of women willing to testify she'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been talking to them from the time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting ended until the typist yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The necklace was missing. Kelly's</seg><seg type="columnLine">men searched the place, but couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">find it. The knife belonged to Mangy--</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Oriental thing he had picked up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">India, Dolores said, where he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied with the masters, whoever they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kelly had traced the call Mangy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been making. He had been talking to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich divorcee, Mrs. Lindsey Barrett,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">when the knife had silenced him. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of his followers. She had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying, ever since he was silenced, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get him again. One of Kelly's dicks told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her he was dead and she must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">fainted. A cop went up to her pent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house to see how she was taking it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found her maid had called two doctors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a nurse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kelly's mob was moving out, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ronald with them. Kelly stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to me, "Joe, if you know anything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">come clean! I'll get your license, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, if you hold out on us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's open and shut, ain't it?" I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ronald or Irene had to do it, didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">they?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll know more when we get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingerprint checkup," he grunted.

There wasn't much about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mangy. He had advertised his meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, but they hadn't run many news</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories about him. In one ,or two brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">notices, Dolores was mentioned. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I dropped around to the printing com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany that had published his book.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mangy had paid for it, cash in advance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they had run off five thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">copies. He had just placed an order</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another five thousand. At four</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars a crack, he was doing pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">well for himself. The head of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany was moaning because he had read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extras; with Mangasarius dead, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order would probably be cancelled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you no faith?" I handed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolores' line. "Leave it to his niece.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She'll carry on and sell his books.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe he'll autograph 'em, if there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ink in heaven."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I didn't gather up any info</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Mangy. He had hit town a year</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, returning from years of study</seg><seg type="columnLine">in India, so he said. Dolores had joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a little later. He had gone over</seg><seg type="columnLine">big from the start. Once the dames</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard him talk, they were sold--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">told their neighbors over the back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence or the bridge-table. The cops had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing on him; they can't tackle a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great teacher like Mangy unless com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaints pour in. A few husbands, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rufus, may have kicked; but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fault if their wives tossed pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ents to Mangy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Getting into the penthouse apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of Mrs. Lindsey Barrett, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 went next, was no cinch. I finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">got in, but I didn't see the lady. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her doctors talked to me. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MIRACLE MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering from severe shock; she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to commit suicide by jumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the parapet that surrounded her</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden. The doctor was a dry, cool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacled fellow; he made no bones</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his feeling for Mangy. Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barrett had refused medical care and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had put her trust in Mangy's Miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like hundreds of other fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">women," the medico said savagely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"she was in love with the fellow."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How did he feel about her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mrs. Barrett is an extremely rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman," he said.

Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barrett can see no one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay, doc," I said, and strolled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the butler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had skipped lunch. 1 gathered up</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the papers and found a steak and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chop joint. I chewed a thick one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed it down with a bottle of beer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and read the papers. Kelly had Ronald</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging. His prints were on the knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with Mangy's. He admitted he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had touched it as it lay on the desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him while he had argued with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mangy. No other prints. Both Ronald</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Irene told the same story: they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">accused Mangy of hypnotizing Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rufus and had threatened him. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at them, fingering the neck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lace the old lady had given him. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they hadn't killed him. He was alive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and triumphant, when they walked out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If that was true, he had been killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the few minutes that elapsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the typist gathered up her let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters and started in to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought of Dolores again. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">might still be the candidate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I saw a sob sister's story. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been to Mrs. Barrett's penthouse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, and she had it from the rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">dame's secretary that Mangy and Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barrett had planned a trip to Yuma--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and marriage. They were talking about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it when he was stabbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uh-huh," I said. "And what does</seg><seg type="columnLine">that add up to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't know, but I checked on Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barrett's ex. No, he wasn't interested;</seg><seg type="columnLine">married again, and on a world cruise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who else wouldn't want her to marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mangasarius? Some of her family,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe; others who might hope to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">herit something from her or otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">get it; perhaps a disappointed suitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mangy had cut out. But how could</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of those get in and stab Mangy</seg><seg type="columnLine">at just that time? No dice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I still gave Dolores a good deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. She was smooth; Kelly didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspect her. She put on a good act.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even if the cops had suspected her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would have a time proving any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Mangy's followers would spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her defense; her act would convince</seg><seg type="columnLine">any jury. Dressed in white, with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgiving smile and her dark eyes, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked too angelic for murder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I phoned Rufus from the steak and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chop dump.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen," I said, "they've got a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your wife's niece.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had everything Dolores or Irene had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plenty of brains in her red head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was back pretty soon, too soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have got an interview.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The lady is not seeing the press,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said. "So I was told by a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of servants. They pushed me around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I got in.

Their "Distributor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agreement" was drawn, of course, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the company's attorney. Even a super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial examination disclosed several in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting points wholly at variance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the impression conveyed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advertisement and the original letter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">122</seg><seg type="columnLine">PICKING YOUR OWN POCKET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The $700 "cash deposit" wasn't a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cash deposit at all but constituted pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment for the merchandise delivered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distributor by the company after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the route was established, and the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributor was required to consign (to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be paid for if and when sold) this to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storekeepers on the "route" to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">established by the company's repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentative.
