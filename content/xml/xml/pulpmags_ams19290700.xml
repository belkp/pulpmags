Such men, we find, are unusually successful as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Draftsmen, because they know how things are done, and that'8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a priceless asset to the man who makes the blueprint plans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For there's a great deal more to Drafting than mechanical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drawing" and reading blueprints. The real jobs, those paying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">$50 to $100 a week, give you a chance to cash In on your entire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">past mechanical experience. Get in touch with me and I'll</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tell you how.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Drafting Is Logically Your Next Move!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Of course you realize the biggest handicap to mechanical work</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is that you're limited in earning capacity to the output of your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two hands, as long as you live. Even the skilled mechanic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earning $50 to $60 a week has reached his limit. He can never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earn more and when he gets old he will earn less. So I don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blame any man for wanting to get away from his futureless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">outlook. For wanting to get into something where he can use</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his head as well as his hands--where he will be paid for what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he knows, instead of only for what he does.......You know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enough about blueprints to understand that PLANS govern</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">every move in factory and construction job. The Draftsman</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who makes them is several jumps ahead of the workman who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">follows them. And so I want you to know that DRAFTING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is a logical, natural PROMOTION from mechanical and building</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">work--better-paid, more interesting--just the kind of work</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you'd enjoy doing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Get My NO-RISK Plan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The way to a fine Drafting Job for you--Is easier than you think.

The accelera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of a heavy electric train, which in a few seconds goes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest up to forty or fifty miles an hour, is seen every day in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subway by crowds of people, who are very much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to get home or to their offices, than they are to notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">this wonderful exhibition of power. The writer once excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion, perhaps unpleasantly, in an acquaintance, by saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was astonished every time he crossed the river in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferry-boat. But to one who has sailed on the same river in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a twenty-foot catboat, and has struggled against a head-sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">close-hauled, the ferry-boat majestically driving through every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing as if waves were unknown and heavy seas were null,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a wonder. The way the boat is built; the steel plates with</seg><seg type="columnLine">what may be termed hermetic joints held together by rivets</seg><seg type="columnLine">heated up nearly white-hot, and headed while hot so that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrinkage operates to tighten the joints, the steel frame, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">members bent accurately into shape, stiffening the hull, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the perfectly working, thought uneconomical steam-engine driv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the screws, one at the bow and one at the stern, its width</seg><seg type="columnLine">four times or more the length of the little sail-boat;' if this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is rightly considered, it is a miracle of engineering.

The hero in this play adopts electricity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the dynamo as his gods, and in the end is killed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very dynamo which he almost worships. The same idea, inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dentally, was used by H. G.

In many cases stories of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">type might rank as impossibilities.

The ferry-boat in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Golden Gate of San Francisco or on the Hudson River of</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York, embodies in its construction and action wonders</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to supply material for an epic poem.

As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am a mathematician and not a laboratory man, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">less to do with the actual construction of the hyperster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eoscope. But even there I helped. I worked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">refractive indices of crystals that he made in an elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric furnace; and I worked out the mathematics of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very ingenious instrument for integrating light rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">from two directions into one composite beam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently the thing was a complex job. Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor Cosgrave spent three weeks in the research labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory of the Mechanical Engineering Department. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to Chicago and remained there for a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, leaving as his address the Psychology Depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the Chicago University. One day he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced to me calmly that the hyperstereoscope was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May I look?" I asked eagerly, expecting to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to see out into the fourth dimension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The instrument was pointed out of the window at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the campus. It had three telescopes arranged in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of a triangular parallelepiped. One end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was full of apparatus, electron tubes and photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric cells, a scanning disk, and tangles of wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">strung between boxes and cabinets faced with dials and</seg><seg type="columnLine">meters. At a small table there were two oculars to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look into. I put my eyes to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It made me dizzy. It looked like rolling vapors--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dense, heavy vapors, and boiling clouds, rolling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turmoiling swiftly and dizzily. It looked vibrant with</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat. Through a rift here and there I got glimpses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a glowing liquid, like the white-hot metal in a foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry coming from the ladle. There were boiling, bub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling lakes of it. I shrank away from the instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" I gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not sure," returned Professor Cosgrave. "Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed observation and correlation of observed data</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be necessary before we can explain what we see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was whirling dials rapidly. I looked again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were vapors, but they were thin spirals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisps. Mostly there were bare, smoking rocks. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a bleak, insufferably dreary stretch of them, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tending on into the infinite distance. It looked hot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was infinitely depressing. I didn't like it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I STOOD for a long time behind Professor Cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave, as he sat at one little table with his eyes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oculars of the instrument and twiddled the dials.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was about to turn around and slip out of the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leave him to play with it alone, when he sat up</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly. A new idea had struck him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beyond a doubt these places that we see are regions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some sort, not in our 'space' at all, or else infinitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away. But, in the direction of the fourth dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion they are quite near us. Just as if you are in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">window on the top story qf a skyscraper office building</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a dozen feet away is a man in the window of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjacent building. To your three-dimensional vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is quite near you. But to your body, whose motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">is confined to two-dimensional surfaces, your friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a long distance away. To your touch, instead of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen feet away he is a quarter of a mile away; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is how far you have to travel before you can reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Or, if I make a mark at each end of this sheet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper and then bend the sheet double, from a three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensional standpoint the marks are a millimeter</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart. But from a two-dimensional standpoint they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are thirty centimeters apart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This stereoscope sees across, in the same way, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other universe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My analogies are poor. It is a difficult idea to</seg><seg type="columnLine">express. But look!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to the eye-pieces. There was water. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">endless. Just water. It swelled and rolled and pul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sated. A swing of the telescopes over at the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought into view some black rocks. Over the rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slime. A slime that flowed and rounded itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">into worm-like forms. It was hideous. I left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloating Professor Cosgrave and hurried away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that, as my recollection serves, things moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly. I saw him a couple of days later at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stereoscope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have it!" he said elatedly when he saw me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened to look into the instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" he exclaimed, pulling me away. "I mean an</seg><seg type="columnLine">analogy. Like points on the leaves of a book. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">see ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded.

You see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now look!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw a dense swamp, among huge trees with broad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich green leaves.

It is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a continuous story. There are steps. Definite jumps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing between. I can see any one of them at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Like the leaves of a book!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked again. The professor had not touched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting and the scene was exactly the same. A huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">saurian was devouring some living creature from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. The water was threshed into a pink foam, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-red blood was splashed over the green foliage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The professor was talking:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What we see is worlds or universes arranged side</seg><seg type="columnLine">by side in the fourth dimension. Like leaves in a book.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Heavens! What an encyclopedia!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," I said slowly, not sure that I really did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Like serial sections cut in a microtome."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Comparable. But not really sections. Separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds. Three-dimensional worlds like our own. Side</seg><seg type="columnLine">by side, each of them one page ahead of the preceding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three-dimensional leaves in a four-dimensional book."</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a little difficult to grasp. I thought a while.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'd like to have Carver of Purdue see this," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do you remember his article in the Scientific Monthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">about your four-space equations?

Let's bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">him down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Cosgrave shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What object can there be in causing the man any</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasant feeling?

That is</seg><seg type="columnLine">just how considerate and sympathetic he always was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Always he was trying to spare other people unpleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antness or discomfort. The man was wasted on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">present-day selfish and discourteous age. He ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been born into some future Utopia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT would he do now? I wondered. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was obviously a vast number of worlds to ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve. It would take a lifetime to have a good look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at each one of them. Would he spend his time on</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfying his curiosity and turn his back on mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matical physics? He still had numerous important</seg><seg type="columnLine">problems ahead of him in the latter field. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely started on his career as a mathematical physicist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet the world was expecting great things of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, for the present there was apparently one</seg><seg type="columnLine">phase of the purely observational pursuit for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The 'leaves' in this book seem to be arranged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely orderly succession," he said. "By chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began at the end where the evolutionary development</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lowest. By swinging my visual field through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown dimension in one direction, I can see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds in succession, each a little further evolved than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preceding. Now, I'm a physicist, and cannot af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford to waste much time in gratifying idle curiosity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, I must spend a few days or weeks in following</seg><seg type="columnLine">out this evolutionary series before I turn it over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some biologist. This is too much of a temptation</seg><seg type="columnLine">for any kind of a scientific man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several days I would come into the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him there with his eyes glued to the oculars, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed even to notice my entrance. His attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of tense and motionless concentration. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would steal out again, loth to disturb him. Once I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in and noted that he was trembling violently all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over as he gazed into the machine. A couple of days</seg><seg type="columnLine">later I found him in the same position, as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not moved since I had been there last. His whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was set and rigid. I was alarmed at the way he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked. I stepped closer; his jaw was set and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing was shallow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt concerned about him, and I made a sound to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attract his attention. He started suddenly and leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet, and turned to me a face that was white with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been a student!" he gasped. "A scientific man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I never stopped to realize that men wrere like that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sank into a chair, his hands on his knees, his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">drooped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked into the stereoscope. This time there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.

The foreground was red and active; every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was splattered with blood; men were swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">swords. There were rows of captives and men cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads off. I watched only a second before I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiled, but saw a dozen heads roll on the ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountains of blood gush over victims and executioners</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have no business looking at that!"

The nearest approaches to</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfection have been achieved by those who used com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite models, combining the face of one with the torso</seg><seg type="columnLine">of another and the limbs of a third.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even with this method, the results produced have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been far from faultless. Witness, for instance, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned criticism of the classic example of feminine</seg><seg type="columnLine">grace, the statue of the Venus de' Medici. Edwin Chad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick, a noted scientist and connoisseur, says that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus de' Medici is lacking in two most important attri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">butes of human beauty--health and mentality. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest is too narrow, indicating insufficient development</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lungs; her limbs are without evidence of due</seg><seg type="columnLine">training of the muscles; and her cranium and face are</seg><seg type="columnLine">deficient in all traits of intellect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Were it possible for the sculptor to produce a flaw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less model of a woman's figure, he is still woefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">handicapped since he can only represent form, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">color or any other attribute of the living being. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">painter has the advantage of being able to impart the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hues of nature. By skilful shading he also gives his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat canvas a third dimension, suggesting solidness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and elegance of contour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But neither the painting nor the statue can depict</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the most important attributes of living beauty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">namely motion.

But the fault with this method</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that, although it is possible to develop strongly</seg><seg type="columnLine">some peculiar or characteristic variation, it is not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy to remove completely those irregularities which</seg><seg type="columnLine">make an organism imperfect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take a specific instance.

Then, too, the matter of sex variation</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduces an element of uncertainty; and, worst of all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments of this sort require an inordinate amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time, besides being attended by overwhelming dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficulties, the nature of which you can readily surmise."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broderick became restless again.

"I don't under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand you," he stammered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must have heard of bone grafting, homoplastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">transplantation, and other marvels of modern surgery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps you are familiar with some of my attainments</seg><seg type="columnLine">along that line."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I remember reading about a girl whom you treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">after her face was badly burned. Didn't you cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">her cheek with the skin taken from her thighs?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ES. That is a very simple operation. Those in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volving the transplanting of organs and limbs are</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more difficult, yet not impossible to the surgeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">who knows his trade. As early as 1908, Debert suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in grafting the lower leg of one dog to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thigh of another, in such a way that it appeared per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly normal. It was even before that time that Lexer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">using the method of juxtaposition, transplanted the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire knee joint of a child. But more wonderful still is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work of Alexis Carrel, who, you know, invented a</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of joining large blood vessels by clamping</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to stop the flow of blood and then sewing them</seg><seg type="columnLine">SUPERPERFECT BRIDE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">303</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">together with silk thread.

Taking another</seg><seg type="columnLine">hint from the artist, I resolved to create a living</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman of unsurpassed beauty, by joining together parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, though taken from imperfect individuals, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves free from flaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course it was necessary that the greater part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my composite woman be taken from one body, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is of course extremely difficult and dangerous to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">many alterations in the so-called vital portions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human anatomy--the head and the torso. My first</seg><seg type="columnLine">task, therefore, was to find a woman who embodied</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfection in these essential parts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I finally discovered, in the person of a young woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">for whom I set a broken leg, all the qualities which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">required. By good fortune, she, like yourself, was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">orphan with no near relatives living. She had an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dependent income of about eighteen hundred dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">a year. A well-known university had granted her a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bachelor's degree, although she was only seventeen years</seg><seg type="columnLine">old. Her interests were mainly for art, literature, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">music, but she had also done work in science and</seg><seg type="columnLine">philosophy. She was very fond of all forms of outdoor</seg><seg type="columnLine">sport, in fact it was while skating that she sustained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the injury which first brought her to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Her torso, her neck and her head were absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect, although the other parts of her body were</seg><seg type="columnLine">susceptible to improvement. You may fancy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicacy with which I broached my purpose to her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, by appealing to her devotion to art. and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feminine ambition to surpass all others in beauty, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">won her consent. She became my adopted daughter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the heiress to my entire estate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I began by providing Eve with a new head of hair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her own hair was pretty enough--a glossy amber</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown,--light and fluffy,--but bobbed, as is the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">with nearly all women today. The scalp she now wears</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to belong to a Norwegian servant girl, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom I bought it for five thousand dollars, giving her</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eve's hair in exchange. When Ingemar recovered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that she still had a full head of growing tresses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was immeasurably pJeased. She said her long</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden hair had always been too much of a bother to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her anyway, and she liked her new hair better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a similar way, I exchanged Eve's imperfect parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">for flawless members from other girls, who consented</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the transfer for considerations varying from one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty thousand dollars. Her ears belong to an Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish girl, and her lips used to grace a French beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but her nose is her own; I merely remodeled it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifle, reducing its size by removing portions from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I got her left arm from a girl who is an expert</seg><seg type="columnLine">swimmer, and her right from one who loves tennis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but hadn't played enough to overdevelop it. Two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dancers, chosen from among five hundred chorus girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplied her legs, at ten thousand each. I found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier to induce two women to trade each a leg, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get one to take the risk of sacrificing both limbs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, it very rarely happens that both arms or both</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs of any one person are perfect mates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The feet belonging to this pair of legs I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not use.

I solved the problem by selecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl who had always worn sensible shoes, and having</seg><seg type="columnLine">her go barefooted for two months before I operated</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had the hardest job in obtaining a perfect right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.

She refused to sell her hand at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any price, and I actually had to kidnap her. When she</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that I intended to take her hand by force,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she agreed to submit voluntarily for twenty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars. Four months after the operation, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to play the piano as well as ever. It was just six</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks ago that I put the finishing touches to my master-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece. Now Eve is completely perfect."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You speak of exchanging member for member,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Broderick, "I don't understand how you can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Â«*T%yTY assistant, Doctor Mann, and I work together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1V1 He removes the member from Eve while I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">separating the corresponding part from the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman.

Then, while the members are still warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and living, they are exchanged and attached by methods</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which every surgeon is familiar. While I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastening the new part to Eve's body, Doctor Mann</seg><seg type="columnLine">performs a similar operation on the other girl.

Yet his involun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary admiration for her was rudely tempered by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocking thoughts; one was the domineering influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">which her foster-father exercised over her, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other was the repulsive notion that she was stuck to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, like a picture puzzle or a crazy patchwork</seg><seg type="columnLine">quilt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Repelled as he was by these considerations, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were far outbalanced by the overwhelming force of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">many attractive attributes. Three-quarters of an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the appointed time, he presented himself at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of Doctor Goddard's lordly residence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're early," the doctor greeted him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Am I ? Is Eve at home ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. I'll send your card up to her. She'll be down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a few minutes. You're fond of chess, aren't you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broderick? I judge so from the fact that you repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented Princeton in the last cable tournament with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oxford and Cambridge. I've arranged to have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">play chess with Eve this evening, if you care to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Broderick suppressed a smile. "Who ever heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman who could play chess?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will remember questioning the existence of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">SUPERPERFECT BRIDE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">305</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect woman yesterday. As then, I'll answer--judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">for yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drew from a corner a small, beautifully finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">table with a chessboard inlaid in squares of ebony and</seg><seg type="columnLine">basswood. The pieces were of ivory, exquisitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">carved. The doctor began placing them on the board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me see, Queen on her color, isn't it? I haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">played for such a long while, I've almost forgotten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ah, here comes Eve."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Broderick's eyes were already fixed on the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtains, as if loath to miss a single instant of delight</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her loveliness. They parted and she appeared, bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fresh causes for wonder and admiration. Now her</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure was veiled in the graceful folds of a short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">waisted empire gown, which smacked of the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages, yet suggested the trim smartness of modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion. Her arms and neck were barer The style of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her heavily massed golden tresses reminded him of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet of Minerva. She bowed, but did not utter a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, as she sat down in the chair which the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "White to move, and win," Goddard chuckled; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she immediately responded by leading with her king's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Broderick played an indifferent, listless game, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">more attention to his opponent's face than to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">moves. But suddenly he woke up to find one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bishops in direct line with an unprotected castle. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out giving the usual careful inspection of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces he swooped down and removed it from its corner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly Eve reached across the board and removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pawn, putting in its place one of her bishops. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">this placed his king in check, Broderick could do noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing else but take the bishop with his knight. Eve re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved the horseman with her queen, which was thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed in the square next to the king, but protected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a knight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Checkmate!" laughed the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Jove, so it is. That's a new one on me. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost the same as the fool's mate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A modification of it which Eve invented herself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rook was just left for bait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She won't catch me napping next time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pieces were replaced, with the whites on Brod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erick's side of the board. There was no more careless</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawdling after that. He started out with the fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">aggressiveness which had won him fame in college</seg><seg type="columnLine">matches, but still kept every piece carefully protected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eve played a defensive game, anticipating his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plex plots with the weird magic of a sooth-sayer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">foiling them with consummate ingenuity. He realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had met an opponent worthy of his skill; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the moment, his fascinated interest in this unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">game, overcame the distracting magnetism of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gleefully felt that he had the upper hand, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, and came near venting his satisfaction in a vain</seg><seg type="columnLine">boast, "Checkmate in three more moves." Luckily for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he restrained this ungentlemanly impulse; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eve, by an unexpected exchange of queens, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke through his line of attack, and put him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deiensive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Broderick fought like a cornered lion, and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">won his way out of a precarious hole, by a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">judicious swaps. He had one piece to the good, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that any even exchange was to his benefit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, after over an hour of playing, he found him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self with a rock and a knight, while she had only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single pawn to support her king. He moved the castle</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a more advantageous position, where, however, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not bear on her king. With seeming unconcern, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed her solitary pawn from the protection of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">king, placing it directly in the path of the threatening</seg><seg type="columnLine">castle. No sooner had Broderick swept the last pawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the board than Doctor Goddard slapped the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yelled, "Stalemate. She can't move, and she's not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in check. The game is a draw." -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, so it is." He glanced at Eve. The smile on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face was not one of triumph. He knew by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glitter in her clear blue eyes that she, like himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a keen lover of the game, and that she played for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sport and not for the pleasure of winning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Goddard snapped open his watch. "Hello, it's past</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eve's bedtime. She has to keep regular hours, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. Mr. Broderick will excuse you now, my dear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he wants revenge, you can give him a chance some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a word, she arose, bowed to the two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gracefully withdrew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Goddard, "what's the verdict?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She certainly knows how to play chess, or else I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dub."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To-morrow, if you wish, you may have an oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to test her physical skill. What is your favorite</seg><seg type="columnLine">outdoor sport?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have three favorites--skating, swimming and ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eve skates and swims unusually well, but tennis</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be the best. Shall we say to-morrow afternoon at</seg><seg type="columnLine">three ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That suits me all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Perfect Sportswoman</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT night, in the seclusion of his chamber,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broderick was beset by a multitude of unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas and conceptions, some of them felicitous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">others distressing. The methodical mind of a chess</seg><seg type="columnLine">player he had never expected to find in a woman, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this added another strand to the chord which he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">binding him to her. "A woman who can play chess</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that would certainly make a man's home life at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tractive. He wouldn't need to go to the club for recrea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus he reflected, showing that he was a true de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">votee of the ancient game of war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, though her prowess at chess was to him an indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation of superior intellectual caliber, yet the mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">control which her foster-father seemed to exercise over</seg><seg type="columnLine">her suggested mental weakness. Broderick even har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bored a suspicion, that Goddard's own mind had en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineered his defeat, and that he had merely used Eve</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a human tool for translating his thoughts into acts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fulminated in his brain the realization that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never heard her speak. Was she deaf and dumb? Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">306</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not deaf, since she responded immediately to sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions addressed to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of several hours of musing, Broderick</seg><seg type="columnLine">was certain of only one thing--he wanted to see her</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tennis match took place at the appointed time</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Goddard's private court. Eve was more delectable</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever, for she had shed her unnatural air of</seg><seg type="columnLine">statuesque antiquity and was a thoroughly modern girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great outdoors. She was attired in a short wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirt of white flannel and a low-necked, short-sleeved</seg><seg type="columnLine">middy blouse. Her blond hair was coiled in thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">braids around her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doctor Goddard acted as umpire, calling the score</seg><seg type="columnLine">after each point. Eve served first. She began by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending a swift twister which fell just inside the corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the court, and spun along, hardly an inch above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fifteen love," Goddard called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the other court, Eve served with her left hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with equal speed but not quite so much English, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broderick hooked over a neat back-handed Lawford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fifteen all," and thus the match progressed, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the honors close to even. Nearly all were deuce games,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hotly contested. Eve played a clever, heady game,</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting unusual cuts on the ball, and placing it in out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the way corners. She was constantly shifting her</seg><seg type="columnLine">racket from one hand to the other, and seemed equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">skilful with either. Broderick depended more upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed than generalship and won most of his points by</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicious chops and tearing smashes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of an hour of playing, the score stood at</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleven and twelve, with Eve serving. Two beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lawfords and a lucky stroke which sent the ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the top of the net so that it dropped gently into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his opponent's court, won three successive points for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broderick. Then Eve made a superb burst of unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed and brought the score up to deuce. Time after</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, he smashed her left-handed serve, but each time</seg><seg type="columnLine">she recovered the point from the other court. At last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the score at " Vantage out," she served a ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Broderick had no difficulty in returning. For sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral minutes, the ball danced back and forth over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">net, then Eve drove a pretty Lawford into his back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand court, immediately following it up to the net. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful footwork, Broderick reached the ball and</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned it, but Eve met it at the net and sent it</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing into the opposite court. It bounded fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet in the air. Broderick dashed back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped for the ball, meeting it squarely, but in doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he crashed into the back-stop, and fell to the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a heap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His high lob fell but a few feet on the other side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the net, where his opponent was ready to receive it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She could have easily dropped it in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">court where he could never have reached it; but in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead she struck it underhand, sending a rainbow lob to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back court. It gave Broderick just time enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">regain his feet and send the ball back to her. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of thirty more seconds of playing, Eve misjudged</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of Broderick's smashes and sent it into the net.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Game and set. Score thirteen to eleven," announced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor. "Broderick, that was marvelous playing."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broderick leaped the net, grabbed her extended hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and panted, "Thank you for a wonderful game. You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best woman player and the finest all around sport</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've ever met."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled and bowed in acknowledgement of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid compliment, but said nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you want to play any more?" This from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Broderick, who was drenched with perspiration and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still puffing, answered, "I've had enough for today."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, that was enough for anyone. I don't care to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have Eve over-exert herself. Now you'd better both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry back to the house and take your showers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a refreshing bath and a change of raiment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broderick joined Goddard in the library.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, how do you like her tennis playing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I certainly enjoy playing with her. She's a clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">sport, and refused to take advantage of my accident.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After beating her I couldn't very well say that she is</seg><seg type="columnLine">an exceptionally good player, but it's the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've ever played a twenty-four game set."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They conversed for some time, then Broderick, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an apparent display of embarrassment, said, "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that's been worrying me, Doctor, and I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to know the truth--Is Eve dumb?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dumb ?" Goddard exploded. "I should say--But as</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual, you'll have to judge for yourself. Come around</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-morrow night at eight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The First Musicale</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HEN he arrived the following evening, Brod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erick was ushered into the music room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've arranged a private musicale, or rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">recital. Eve will entertain us, if you care to have her</seg><seg type="columnLine">do so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'd be delighted," was the trite response.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The first number will be a piano solo. Have you any</seg><seg type="columnLine">special preferences in music?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm very fond of Grieg."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well, we'll have the suite from Peer Gynt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was arranged with all the formalities of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cert hall. Eve was dressed in a modern decollete gown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stepped to the grand piano and immediately struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening chords of the Morning Mood. The trill</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lark, the ripple of the brook, all were marvelously</seg><seg type="columnLine">counterfeited in this superb combination of tones. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed the lugubrious strains of the Death of Asefi the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird, oriental cadences of Anitra's Dance, and last of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the grand climax of thundering chords which cul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minated in the Hall of the Mountain King.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you very much," was Broderick's sole com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Next will be a vocal solo," the doctor announced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The younger man held his breath in blissful expecta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. At last he was to hear her voice. He was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointed, for her tones were characterized by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich mellifluence which appealed to his layman's musical</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense far more than those of any professional diva.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The piece she sang was unfamiliar to him, but was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraught with intricacies in the form of runs and sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den transitions from low to high notes, which displayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">SUPERPERFECT BRIDE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">307</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">unquestionable technical skill. It fascinated him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not nearly so potently as the exquisite lyrical orchid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I love you truly," which she sang as an encore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the close of this selection, Doctor Goddard arose;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, offering a conventional excuse, quietly withdrew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Left alone with the perfect woman, Broderick ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perienced a singular shyness, which was entirely foreign</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his nature, for he was usually quite at ease in</seg><seg type="columnLine">feminine society. He wanted to pay her a compliment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet hesitated lest it sound like the adulation of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sycophant. At last he said, "You have a beautiful voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Goddard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a suggestion of conceit or feigned modesty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she answered simply, "I'm glad you like it. But I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you sing also. Won't you try this with me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She opened a sheet of music, which was by no means</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfamiliar to him. It was a duet in which the woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice and the man's took alternate parts, finally blend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into a united, harmonious appeal:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh love, stay one moment, oh love, stay one moment;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One moment of ecstacy, thy heart throbbing on my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Life's long dream is o'er, life's dream is o'er.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farewell, farewell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So perfectly did their voices blend that an expert</seg><seg type="columnLine">critic would have judged they had practised together</seg><seg type="columnLine">for months. Several other songs they essayed, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">complex, some simple; some sentimental, others hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last she turned to him with a smile and said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pardon my seeming inhospitableness if I remind you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my father is very exacting and insists that I retire</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly at ten. I know you won't be offended, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope we are good enough friends to be perfectly frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">with each other. But before you go, I want you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise to bring your violin with you next time you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I play only in a very amateurish way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are both amateurs, and enjoy our art all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more because we pursue it for pleasure alone. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">your singing, I know you have the soul of a musician.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll bring your violin and your favorite pieces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">music, won't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you wish. And may I see you to-morrow eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall be very glad to have you call to-morrow."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The following evening Broderick found Eva alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the music room. She rose from the piano bench to</seg><seg type="columnLine">greet him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Father is working at some experiments, and asks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be excused."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A courteous bow was Broderick's response; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not stultify himself by any insincere expressions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">regret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see you didn't forget," she remarked anent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument case which he carried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I didn't forget, much as I hesitate to play be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore you. Please don't be too critical, will you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't expect to have anything to criticise. Shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">we try something right away? I just love to play ac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">companiments," and she struck the A key on the piano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Imbued with the desire to make a good impression,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inspired by her faultless accompaniments, Broder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ick played with a brilliancy and ferver which astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Evelyn complimented him in the most cogent</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner possible, by continually asking him to play</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of an exquisite Strauss waltz, she ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, "Oh, wouldn't that be wonderful to dance to ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wish we could play and dance at the same time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you like to dance?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Indeed I do. I enjoy dancing better than any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of amusement."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There's the phonograph," he suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And we have the record of that very waltz. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">start it while you roll up the rug."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A moment later, the phonograph began to send forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">its regular cadences, and Eve fluttered into Broderick's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. He was accustomed enough to the feel of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's body in close proximity to his, but Eve was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unquestionably different. The fragrance of her hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gentle heaving of her womanly bosom, the touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fingers on his arm thrilled him with ecstatic, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure emotions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And if she charmed him by her mere proximity, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">incomparable skill as a dancer fascinated him. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he danced with original abandon, following no set rules</seg><seg type="columnLine">or conventional steps, she followed him as if her</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles were dominated synchronously by the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves which actuated his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The great clock in the hall boomed out ten resonant</seg><seg type="columnLine">strokes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The witching hour," smiled Eve. "I have a fairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">godfather who is more exacting than Cinderella's god-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother by two hours; and unless I obey him, I am in</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger of losing the gifts he bestowed upon me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Broderick took the hint and his departure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Proposal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE daily meetings soon became a matter of cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom rather than appointment. Though her chess</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing, her athletic prowesses, her music, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her dancing had in turn attracted and charmed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broderick soon discovered that he enjoyed conversing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her most of all. There seemed to be no subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">in literature, art, science or philosophy interesting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, which was not at least passably familiar to Eve.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He learned that she had been abroad for a year, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a fluent command of French, German, Italian and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One evening the talk turned to John Stuart Mill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What is your idea of perfect happiness?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fervently he responded, "My idea of perfect hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piness is to hold you in my arms and press my lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">against yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surprised and hurt by his seeming rudeness, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned, "Oh, you don't mean that. It's so unworthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Genuine contrition gripped him. "No, I didn't mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">it exactly that way. But if you ask me to paint a picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Paradise, it would include a little six-room bungalow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">presided over by the one perfect woman in the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">308</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There would be a lawn, and a garden, and two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three youngsters to rush out and meet me when I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">home tired after the day's work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That's a little better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it's very commonplace, and rather lacking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambition, I know, but I'm dreadfully selfish, and I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the greatest happiness comes to a man through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own home and family. Now tell me what your idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I've had such lofty aspirations--altogether im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible and impractical, I fear. If I could only ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complish something really big--something which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a blessing to all humanity--like the invention of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio, for instance, then I should indeed be happy. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, that can never be. So I do the next best</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, and get all the pleasure I can out of working</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my hands for those whom I love. Would you</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to see my workshop?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anticipating his assent, she led the way to a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">room at the rear of the building. "Here is my room. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">consider it more characteristic of me than my sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing chamber. Father won't let me have all the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus I'd like, for fear I'll injure some of my precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">members, but I manage to do some work in brass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Broderick cast interested glances about the room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was struck with the neat orderliness, which nevertheless</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seem to remove the impression that it was put</seg><seg type="columnLine">to frequent use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Eve saw him stop to inspect an object lying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bench, an involuntary cry escaped her. A second</seg><seg type="columnLine">look explained the cause. The article was a card case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of leather, beautifully embossed, and Broderick was</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounded to see his own initials worked in the cover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I didn't want you to see that. I made it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. To-morrow is your birthday."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, so it is. I'd forgotten it myself. How in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world did you know?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I got it from the application blank you made out</seg><seg type="columnLine">for father."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It certainly was thoughtful of you.

And now I want to talk with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a matter of great importance to both of us, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing which we both must have had in mind right</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, though we have scrupulously avoided mention-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it. You know what I mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean father's proposal?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and I want to supplement it with a proposal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my own. First, let me tell you that I love you very,</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much, so much that I can think of nothing else.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I want to ask you if you, of your own free will,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without thought of the obligations you owe your foster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, agree to the proposition he made me.

He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything in readiness for the first operation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to the man who was to provide the new member</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a perfect right leg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scenes of the operating room were new to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broderick, who had not experienced a sick day since</seg><seg type="columnLine">childhood. With undisguised interest he watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful preparations; and when the sickening reek of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether reached his nostrils, he welcomed it as a har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">binger of new experiences. Heavy, irresistible drowsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness slowly took possession of him; then he had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation of falling, or rather drifting through space;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally came a thought-free void.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he again recovered consciousness, he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself lying on a bed in a many windowed room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed filled to the bursting point with sunlight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Goddard was bending over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you feel?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, all right. Just a little dizzy and sick to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will soon pass off. Does your leg ache?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the first reminder of the reality of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation. At first he was not sure that he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">right leg, and he had to feel with his hand to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain. He was surprised at the touch of his bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin, instead of the bandages he had expected. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously, he wriggled his great toe. It seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work very naturally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May I move my leg?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely. You can do anything you want with it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broderick elevated his knee, twisted his ankle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to kick like a man whose foot has fallen asleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he threw back the covers of the bed and sat up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Try to walk on it," suggested the doctor; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broderick complied, with the tread of a man suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fering from a severe attack of the gout. Five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cautious limping brought him to a chair. Here he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down, and began to examine his right leg. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a puzzled expression on his face, he appealed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor. "Do you know, that leg looks exactly like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one I've been using for the last twenty odd years?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddard smiled. "It is the same one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean you didn't perform the operation?" Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uine disappointment was echoed by the question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I didn't undertake it. Get into your clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'll explain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "First," the doctor continued, "I want to apologize to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and to confess that I have deceived you from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very start. Eve is not an adopted child but is my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural daughter. Moreover, she is not perfect, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">she comes as near to it as careful nurture and training</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make a woman. As for my scheme for creating</seg><seg type="columnLine">a perfect being, that was but a yarn invented for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">SUPERPERFECT BRIDE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">309</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion. It is accurate enough in theory, but I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel far enough advanced to undertake it in actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice as yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You naturally wonder what it is all about. To me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eve's happiness is the most important consideration in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world; and I believe that she can only attain hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piness through marriage with a man who is all that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man should be. There was just one thing concerning</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I wanted to assure myself, and the story of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect woman was the last crucial test. This you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed successfully, and you have convinced Eve and</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that you possess the highest form of courage--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage which prompts a man to risk life and limb in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interests of science and human achievement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now. I suppose you would like to see Eve. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will find her in the room where you first met her. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before you go, perhaps it might interest you to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the nude figure you saw that first day, was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but a life-sized oil painting, which was so well done</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so skilfully lighted that it looked just like a living</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. No doubt you've heard of 'Stella' and similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">illusions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a mumbled commonplace of some sort, Broder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ick left the room, and, his mind teeming with intoxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating, puzzling thoughts, strode along the corridor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found Eve clinging to the curtains through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had first stepped into his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anxiously she greeted him, "Has father told you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Everything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now that you know, what do you think of me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">By way of answer, he gathered her up in his arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crushed his lips to hers in a fervid, suffocating</seg><seg type="columnLine">kiss. "That is what I think of you," he panted. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">love you a million times more, now that I know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are a real woman, and that every part of you is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own dear self."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I'm far from perfect."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To me, you shall always be more than perfect--my</seg><seg type="columnLine">superperfect bride."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Are you sure you have 110 fault to find with me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There have been only two things about you that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">objected to.

Naturally, such a spending of the twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hours did not provide his wife with the luxuries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life and, gradually, through the years, she had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to regret the fact that her husband was just plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robert Smith instead of an Edison. Of course, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she married him she was under the delusion that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">really would invent something which would make them</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealthy.

A sample of it, properly polarized, will rest in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the air unsupported an inch or more above a magnet. What</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a mass of this highly permeable alloy would do with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">huge magnet, has not yet been shown. But several ideas</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suggest themselves to anyone who can visualize scientific</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">possibilities or possible future inventions as to what might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">happen if this metal were combined with others or if it were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">used in a somewhat restricted form. But Dr. Keller is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">well known for the unique manner in which he makes a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">future possibility seem a thing of current occurrence. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">human interest in the story only adds to its literary value.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think that is a good thing. We have too many</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws as it is. What State does this man Einstein come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from? I do not recall his name. But I really do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how all the laws could be put into one law. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be a newspaper mistake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Einstein, my dear, is a German," replied her hus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">band.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, of course, they have to be represented. Still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think that they ought to be careful in regard to elect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing these foreigners. He may be a Bolshevik."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You still do not understand. This man is not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">senator. He is a scientist. When it says that he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">formulated a new law, it means a law of physics. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">has nothing to do with government."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">said a law. I guess I know what a law is. And an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other thing, don't yell at me so. You talk so loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it is no pleasure to listen to you any more. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would spend your evenings in taking a correspond-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence course in something instead of reading about things</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody understands, you would get away from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribbon and lace counter. I showed you that paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Improvement Institute. A man was taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that course and he changed from a salary of twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars a week to ten thousand a year, and he only</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied ten weeks. Well, what about this new law?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It means this," replied Smith, in a rather low</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         voice, "many centuries ago</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    1 â  â 	man realized that light and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heat were related. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joule and Rumford showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that light, heat and energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">are related according to</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite physical laws. Thus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy was added to light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heat. Now, gradually,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scientists have shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">that to these three forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be added matter, space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, gravitation and elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity. The only factor</seg><seg type="columnLine">absent was to determine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">relation between electricity and gravitation. According</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Einstein, there is only one substance, 'the field,' and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this field contains electrical and gravitational compo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nents which are closely tied together by a single for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mula. That, to me," said Smith gravely, "is a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable discovery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And to me," replied his wife, "it does not mean a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you do not understand just what this means!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost shouted Robert Smith. "This article says that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it means that man can fly. Not in a plane or a balloon,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">310</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fancy, Smith was now up In the air. Now he could stay up without turning over. He could press a button and go up, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">press another button and slowly come down--like a thistledown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">311</seg><seg type="columnLine">312</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but just go up in the air! The thing that holds us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the earth is gravitation. If that can be overcome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why mankind can go up into space. I believe I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in that, a very simple machine, which could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be produced for a few hundred dollars--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his wife interrupted him. She was led to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so by past experience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A few hundred dollars would pay our expenses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for several months."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Robert Smith was so absorbed that he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard her remark. Just then the baby cried in the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Robert," said Mrs. Smith, "will you go and tend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the baby? I must finish this mending. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is your child as much as it is mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please stop calling the baby 'it.' She is too old, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides, she has a very nice name."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless, he put down the paper and disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the shadows of the next room to attend to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN he returned from the care of the baby,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found that his wife had gone to bed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds from their bedroom indicated that she was fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep. So, relaxing, Smith started to read the article</seg><seg type="columnLine">very carefully. He read that a New York professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was making some startling statements about the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">law of Einstein. He prophesied that the time would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come when airplanes would be able to remain in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air without engines or visible support; that a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly equipped, could step out of a twenty-story</seg><seg type="columnLine">window and not be in danger of falling; and that, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">it not for the deadly cold of the regions beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's atmosphere, a trip to the moon might be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very easy matter. This law provided a means for</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulating the body against the laws of gravitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That would be rather fine," said Smith, softly, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. "That would be the real thing. This air</seg><seg type="columnLine">work they are doing now is too complicated. I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that it will ever be popular. Besides, it is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">very dependent on machinery and fuel, and a person</seg><seg type="columnLine">has to keep on going. Now, my idea is to go up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air about fifty feet and just slowly mosey around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I feel that it would be so much more pleasant than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way they do it now. Then I would want to stop, if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw anything interesting beneath me, and stay where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the air till I had made a thorough examination</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the particular object my attention had been called</seg><seg type="columnLine">to. You cannot do that in a plane--in one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">things a man has to keep on moving or fall. The big</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing would be to have a cheap apparatus, costing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few hundred dollars. Something that would go up</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily, stop at any point and stay there in the air;</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that would move slowly, be easily guided</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in some way obtain all of its power through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. It would have to go up like a slow elevator and</seg><seg type="columnLine">come down like a feather or a thistledown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That would be a fine apparatus to own. A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could go on little excursions in the evening, after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife was asleep, and it would sort of take his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">off of things. There are so many things that I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to see from the air. I bet Broadway would be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an interesting sight, or the Statue of Liberty, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly would be a lark to take a piece of chalk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">write your name on the top of the Washington Monu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Of course, for a long trip it would be necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me to tell the wife just where I was going--but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, she would have no objections if I brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">back a nice present for her. Going across the ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a little dangerous, but it ought to be safe to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go up the Hudson. After a little practice a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could go a great distance, if he had a box of lunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It all ought to be rather easy. All we need is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">starter and a stopper, and, of course, the stopper</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be just a gradual shutting off of the starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">force. Then there would have to be something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause a progressive movement in the air, something like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the propeller of an airplane and something more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide the thing with, and there would have to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of obtaining power from the air; of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is lots of power and all kinds of electrical waves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the question of hooking the engine on to them is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I could just do that--just that simple invention--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would be rich--perhaps, rich enough to educate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby. I believe I can do it if I can only work out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few of the details. There would have to be some kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a chair to sit on and something to keep the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine from turning upside down. That would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">most embarrassing, even to be a hundred feet in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and have it turn over and dump you out. I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not like that to happen--at least, not until I have more</seg><seg type="columnLine">insurance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next morning he was once again a seller of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribbons and laces, but it was hard to keep his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind on the delicate difference in the tints and colors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the various designs of lace. He sold these things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing behind a counter, to dozens of ladies stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing before the counter, but his soul was far away--</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air. He day-dreamed of floating up and whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pering in the ear of the Sphinx, that peculiar woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who could live a thousand generations without betray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a secret or uttering a word. He thought that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be fine to go slowly over the top of Mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ararat and see if. the Ark was still there, where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grounded in the days of Noah. He promised him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self that he would spend a Sunday over the Battle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field of Gettysburg, a place sacred to him because his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandfather had died there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That noon, as he ate the lunch that he always brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him from home, he feverishly read the evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper. He was still on the trail of Einstein. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a singular coincidence that he found one of the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts that he was looking for. It was just a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement to the effect that the Bell Telephone labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tories had produced a new alloy called permalloy, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was particularly sensitive in its relation to magnetism.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When a bar of it was placed above a magnet, the bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of permalloy rose in the air and floated an inch above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magnet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That made Robert Smith do a lot of thinking. Could</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man pull himself up in the air by lifting on his boot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FLYING FOOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">313</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">straps? Suppose there was a magnet and resting on it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a bar of permalloy? Both the magnet and the bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be of the same size. The bar is repelled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnet to such a degree that it rises two inches above</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and remains suspended in the air. What Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not make out was this problem. Suppose the bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fastened to the magnet so that it could only rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">one inch in the air? But is the other inch to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignored? There is a pull there. Would it go up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extra inch? If it did, it would have to pull the magnet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it, as they cannot be more than an inch apart. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">it kept on doing that, what was there to keep it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on right up into the air? The magnet would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the same. The permalloy would always try to with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw two inches from the magnet, and in doing so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would always pull the magnet upward. If it did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then gravitation would be overcome, and if a man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated on the bar, he would go up with the magnet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, Smith realized that certain formulas</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to be determined. Just how much should</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar of permalloy weigh in proportion to the weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the magnet? Would the lifting ability of the bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in proportion to its weight or in relation to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of the magnet. How long would the magnet re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain its magnetism? Could it be recharged by elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical induction while it was in the air? But to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith's eager mind these were but details, petty trifles</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be worked out after the larger facts had been de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined. What he was sure of was his ability to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise in the air, provided he had a magnet and a bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of permalloy and a chair to sit on fastened to the bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hastily eating his dinner, he went to a public tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone booth and called up the Bell Telephone Company.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had they any permalloy to sell? To his surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they said they had and how much did he want--it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten dollars a pound--in the form of a very fine wire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said that he would call them later, and went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ribbon and lace counter. He knew that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could secure a magnet without difficulty, but how</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he manage with five pounds of wire? For fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars was about all that he could spend. Even that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a birthday present that he had carefully con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed from his wife. Then the wonderful thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him. After long months of careful saving</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the part of his wife, she had finally put aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to get a new suit for him--a real tailor-made</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit. There had been several trying periods of measure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and fittings. He would take this five pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fine wire and have the tailor sew it in, in some way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all through the suit. Then all he would need was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair tied to the magnet and himself tied to the chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and up they would go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I may be a flying fool," he whispered to himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but it certainly will be wonderful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took him several days of going without his lunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">to buy the metal wire and show the puzzled tailor</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what he wanted done. Of course, this increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">the charge for the suit, but Smith paid that himself out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his personal allowance. He was particular in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions that under no circumstance was his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be told about the wire. He finally obtained a prom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ise that the suit would be delivered in a few weeks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As a matter of fact it was delivered and hung in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moth bag a full week before the rest of the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was completed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN fancy, Smith was now up in the air. He had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time at all in perfecting a simple arrangement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wires which, when a button was pressed, would ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tract a powerful current of electricity from the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere, and this, as everyone has known from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days of Benjamin Franklin, is constantly surcharged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this mysterious force. It was no trick at all to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the magnet and attach to it the wires. He arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have the starting button at the side of his chair. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to press the button; that would greatly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease the magnetism which would repel the permalloy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his clothes, and up they would go. When he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come down, he would cease to pull the electricity</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the air, the magnetic force would slowly wear</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and down he would come, like a thistledown--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked the idea of coming down like a thistledown--</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other thought made him shudder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the question of balance bothered him. Suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tilted? And turned over? Where would the pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">come then? Certainly it would be difficult to enjoy a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride upside down. And landing on the ground, head</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, tied to a chair, would be too ridiculous. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought of the gyroscope! That solved everything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would be the stabilizer. Nothing would be easier</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to have a gyroscope under the chair. All he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do was to make the gyroscope the wheel of an electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor, with finely adjusted contact mechanisms to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce to a minimum the problem of friction. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">run the motor from the same electrical source that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to electrically induct his magnet. Now, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the air and was going to stay right-side-up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The securing of a small gyroscope was a problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">that almost proved to be too great for the ribbon seller.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He probably never would have solved it were it not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friend, who, knowing of his problem, told him of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small private yacht that was being torn to pieces as</seg><seg type="columnLine">junk. This small pleasure boat had an equally small</seg><seg type="columnLine">gyroscope to keep it from rolling at sea. Smith found</seg><seg type="columnLine">out what the cost was, and it was possible, by selling</seg><seg type="columnLine">some very special jewels left him by his father to buy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gyroscope. It was very small, but it worked per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly and fitted to perfection in the space under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat of the chair. And it was almost noiseless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he could stay up without turning over. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could press a button and go up, and another button</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slowly come down, like a thistledown, and all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the little gyroscope would keep him right side up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, all his problems were solved and all his money</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, and he still had the problem of moving through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. It would not be very interesting to just go</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from the balcony and stay up for a while and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">come down on the balcony again, though, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would be pleasant on a hot evening and rather a</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief at other times. But he wanted to move. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to go somewhere, if only to Coney Island. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew rather tired of seeing his wife darn stockings</seg><seg type="columnLine">--every night; though it was dear of her to do so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">314</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as a last resort, he conceived the idea of using</seg><seg type="columnLine">an electric fan. He could attach it to the back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, or he could fix it so that it would have a mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able point of attachment. Then he could go and come</seg><seg type="columnLine">and perhaps even turn around. He would not go fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but he did not want to go fast--He just wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go somewhere and see something. It made no dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference what it was, just so he could get away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the daily grind of laces and ribbons and ribbons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laces and more laces and starting to work every morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and back again every night and stockings--He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ashamed of himself, but he was nervous about</seg><seg type="columnLine">those stockings, and he knew that it was his fault that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were not thrown away and new ones bought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men were wearing such fancy stockings now-a-days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he only got stockings at Christmas as presents from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife, and from his mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had an electric fan. He experimented and found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his surprise, that he could run it on electricity taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the air in the same way that he was securing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the electric current for the motor of the gyroscope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And right there Robert Smith hovered on the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming a multimillionaire. Had he patented that</seg><seg type="columnLine">little idea and protected the patent, his wife would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had no more need to darn stockings, but all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could think of at that time was going up in the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He adored calling himself a flying fool. It sounded so</seg><seg type="columnLine">very devilish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naturally, he could not assemble the pieces of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus without his wife having some idea that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new invention was in process of birth. But she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived through so many of these wonderful money-</seg><seg type="columnLine">making plans that never amounted to a hill of beans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this latest effort of her husband's left her cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and uninterested. She simply deplored silently and</seg><seg type="columnLine">openly the fact that he was not getting more sleep, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was sure this insomnia would result in his lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficiency as a salesman of ribbons and laces, and that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she often said, was really the way that they managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live from year to year, and it was especially im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant now, since little Angelica had come to live</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them. She always said it that way, as though, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing the initiative on the baby, she took from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own shoulders the burden of having made a failure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the major factor of companionate marriage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Smiths lived in an old-fashioned part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. In fact, unkind friends said behind their backs</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they lived in the slums. However, their house</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a balcony extending back from the second story</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this balcony having no roof, it was especially de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sirable as a starting and landing place for Smith's</seg><seg type="columnLine">new anti-gravitation machine. Two small bedrooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened out on this balcony by French wipdows. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that the bedrooms connected with each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it an ideal arrangement. The baby slept in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and her parents in the other. When she cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was very easy for the one who heard her first to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">after her--and Robert Smith was a light sleeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GRADUALLY, Smith assembled his machine on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this balcony. When he was not working at it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept it covered with an old canvas. It just looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like an old chair to his wife; so, she did not bother it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as the weather was cold, she humored him by al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing him to use the electric fan. In her way she</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved him, but, perhaps, her affection would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">equaled her devotion had he been able to secure for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the family a better income. However, she was really</seg><seg type="columnLine">in love with him, and even if life had not brought her</seg><seg type="columnLine">all she had hoped for, she was inclined to be philo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sophical about it. So she left his funny old chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, and kept on darning the stockings and trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a dollar buy two dollars' worth of food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, the machine was completed. Smith sat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chair one night and tested the different parts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One button started the gyroscope, another started the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fan, while a third made the fan move slowly on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal track. There were other buttons connected with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magnet, but they were useless, so long as he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have on his new suit. Several nights after the suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">came he waited till his wife was asleep and then lov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly took it out of the moth bag. The tailor had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather skillful in sewing the wire in through the various</seg><seg type="columnLine">garments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All was ready. Valuable evenings had been spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">working on the mathematics of the invention. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to be sure that it was powerful enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry his weight and also the weight of the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine. Even while he was working, the singular</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought came to him that all his calculations were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnecessary, because if the permalloy was repelled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magnet it had to take with it anything that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to. Right here the idea came to him of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small circular track, with a block of permalloy on</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels, constantly retreating from a magnet on wheels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The very idea of it--the constant revolutions--why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was almost perpetual motion--made him so dizzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he nearly fell out of his chair, and his wife in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted on his taking a dose of calomel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of his calculations he was satisfied that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing had been neglected. It was just a question</seg><seg type="columnLine">of putting on that new suit, strapping himself to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair and pressing a few buttons. He decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait till the moon was full and that would be just one</seg><seg type="columnLine">more night. Then when he was sure that his wife was</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep, he would dress and soar. In a peculiar way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was hard for him to understand, this first ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture in the air meant freedom to him, and yet he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not comprehend just what it was that he wanted re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lease from.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that he was afraid of was that it would rain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course, he knew that he could carry an umbrella,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that seemed, somehow, to be hardly suitable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the next evening came, he found that all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fears had been useless. It was not only clear, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a wonderful night. A strong wind had cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atmosphere; it was warm; there was hardly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath stirring at ten o'clock, and the moonlight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so strong that it was almost possible to see the print</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a newspaper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Smith unconsciously helped her husband in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plans by going to bed early. In fact, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound asleep by nine. The baby had been asleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">for several hours. Smith tiptoed into their bedroom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FLYING FOOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">315</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">took the new suit, moth bag and all, and tiptoed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the baby's room. There he rapidly and as quietly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could, changed suits. He was glad to see how well</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coat and vest fitted him. On his way to the bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cony he had to pass the little crib. He paused a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, even touched the little girl's hand. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">always been a wonder to him--he never fully under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood just how it was that she had come into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life--but at night, as she slept, she was almost a</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle. For a long minute he hung over the crib, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfy himself that she was breathing. And the love</seg><seg type="columnLine">that passed between them in some way recalled another</seg><seg type="columnLine">love, and he thought of his wife, of what had been, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their early hopes and ambitions and how, gradually,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one by one those hopes had slowly been blasted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, at the age of nearly fifty, he was still a salesman</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ribbons and laces. He quietly walked to her bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side--she was still a pretty woman--and he realized,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as never before, just what she had meant to him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what she had done for him and sacrificed for him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all those years of their married life. And in addition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had somehow found that little new love of his,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the charming Dresden china baby, Angelica.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bent over and kissed her hair and then, sighing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through the door, out on the gallery, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">his soaring invention awaited him. He sat down in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair and started to fasten the straps. Everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all ready to press the starting button--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the baby cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SMITH sat still; perhaps she would go to sleep; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she cried again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A woman's clear voice came to his straining ears:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Robert, can you take care of the baby? She has</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried twice now and I am sure that she needs atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I am so sleepy, and I know you are still dressed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I will attend to her as soon as I can," Smith re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied. He unstrapped himself and went into the nur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sery. Sure enough Angelica needed help. With skill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, loving hands, he quietly cared for her, talking lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle nonsense verses to her as he did so, in the hope that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would not become wide-awake. But she did. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he left her crib, her little whimperings told him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she wanted him. She even sat up in bed and the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment was standing up, ready to play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to persuade her to lie down. He told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that papa was building a flying machine and if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a good girl, he would let her ride in it, like a bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">some day. He had made this promise to her before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it had always put her to sleep, but this time it</seg><seg type="columnLine">only seemed to make her more excited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Angie fly birdie," she insisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sighing, Robert Smith took his daughter out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crib, and then the wonderful thought came to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would be a fine thing to take her with him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hold her in one arm and manage all the buttons</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the other hand. It was a pleasant night, warm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he would not go far, perhaps simply go up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air for a while and then come right back down again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He carried Angelica out on the balcony and reseated</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the chair. It was a little hard to strap him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self in, but he finally did so, and he even found enough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strap left over to put around the baby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She enjoyed it all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Angelica," whispered the gray-haired man, "your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">father is a flying fool and so is his little baby."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Angie fly birdie," cooed the little one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Robert Smith shut his eyes. At last he had come to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the parting of the ways. Here was freedom and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">adventure and perhaps romance, and he was sure that,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the baby in his arms, the romance would be of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the purest variety. His heart began to beat faster; he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">held the baby so tight that she began to whimper--and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then he pressed the starter button.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Nothing happened--not a thing was different--sick-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ened with disappointment, he realized that nothing was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">going to happen. Somewhere there had been a mistake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As he sat there, the little girl went to sleep. Tired</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of waiting, anaesthetized by the fresh air, perhaps a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little cold, she had cuddled close to her father and gone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to sleep. Almost as in a dream, Robert Smith un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strapped himself and carried his sleeping daughter to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her crib. She simply relaxed and kept on sleeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then Smith undressed--he put his new suit back in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the moth bag and hung it up--and then he prepared for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bed. Somehow, his wife awoke. It was a rather</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unusual thing for her to do this, and Smith did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">understand it till she started to talk to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You know, Robert, a most unusual thing happened</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this week, and I have been trying to find time and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">right occasion to tell you about it. You know how I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have planned and saved for that new suit, and how</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">proud I was to think that at last you were going to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have one tailor-made instead of a hand-me-down. Well,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when that suit came, I examined it very carefully, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it had the most peculiar wire threaded through it, long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pieces. I worked and worked at it and finally got it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all out, and I took it to a dealer in old metals and he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said he would give a dollar a pound for it, and it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weighed just five pounds. So, there I had five dollars,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and I spent it for stockings for you. I bought you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">six pairs, and they are guaranteed to be hole-proof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You needed some new stockings. I have tried to dam</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them as carefully as I could, but I really don't see how</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you could wear them, being on your feet the way you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are all day. Now, how can you explain that wire in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that new suit? I called up the tailor and I believe he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was puzzled himself; at least, he acted so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It certainly is odd," answered her husband. "But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I am glad you bought me the new stockings. You sew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">too much. Did you buy me striped or colored ones?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No. I thought for your ribbon and lace work it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be better to have black ones. Do you know, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">am wide-awake? I want to talk. I was reading today</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about a man's claiming that some day men would float</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the air. What do you think of that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I think that any man who wanted to do a thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like that would be a flying fool!" said Robert Jones</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slowly. Then he forced himself to go to sleep, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the next day he would be busy, selling ribbons and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">END</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Ey Captain S.PMeek, U.S.A.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Author of: "The Murgatroyd Experiment"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ENNETH, there is a legal-looking letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">here for you," said Rose as I entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew that we had a States mail to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day," I replied as I took the letter from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and sank into an easy chair.

It contained the news that Thomas Wallace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of New York had died on December 11th as a result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">injuries sustained in an automobile accident. It also</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated that his will had been examined and that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been named sole heir to his estate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sole heir!" exclaimed Rose. "Was he worth much?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About twenty millions," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rose gasped at the immensity of the sum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heavens!" she exclaimed.

"He was a man who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed with too much knowledge and one who fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">unavailingly against fate and waged a battle that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew from the start was a losing one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nine months before when the Berengaria docked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at New York, I was one of the first men down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gangplank. I had not set foot on the soil of my native</seg><seg type="columnLine">land for nearly fourteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, and I was anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how the atmosphere of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the busiest city in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">would affect nerves attuned</seg><seg type="columnLine">for nearly a decade and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half to Peruvian mining</seg><seg type="columnLine">camps. On the dock I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked eagerly around for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the friend who had prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised to meet me. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing that resembled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trim athletic figure I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">expecting and I started for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the far end of the customs shed, when a hand fell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulder and a tired listless voice sounded in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You haven't changed a great deal, Ken," it said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I whirled around, my hand outstretched to greet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner of the welcoming voice, but I paused in the act</seg><seg type="columnLine">of greeting him. The alert vigorous figure that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected was not there and it took an effort for me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize my friend in the carelessly dressed individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">who stood before me. It was to be expected that four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen years would take some of the bloom of youth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from a man, but Tom Wallace had aged forty years in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that length of time. It was not the droop of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders or the lines in his face that impressed me;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the expression that he wore. His was the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man who had acquired all knowledge and had tasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">all pleasure and had found that wisdom was vanity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the taste of pleasure was the taste of wormwood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ashes. His face was lined with sorrow and grief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I have seen faces so marked that still radiated life</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hope and faith in the future. I could not place his</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression for a moment and then it dawned on me</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I had seen a similar one. It was the same ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression that I had seen shortly before his execution on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of a criminal condemned to die. It was a face</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoid of hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an effort I dissembled my surprise and greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him heartily. He shook my hand in the same tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">listless way, in which he had spoken and asked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">my luggage. Evidently he was a man of some promi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nence, for a word from him was enough to secure a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Customs Inspector promptly and to pass me through in</seg><seg type="columnLine">short order.

We were fraternity brothers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had lived in the same house for several years and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that accounted for our semi-intimacy, which is all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it really amounted to. He had a flair for mathematics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially of the abstruse and philosophical type, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">my energies had been devoted to the more concrete and</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical studies of the course in mining engineering</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was pursuing. My only really close association</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Tom had come in my senior year. He had wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipped at the shrine of a local goddess who heeded only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the offerings of athletes and he had come to me asking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for aid in developing athletic ability.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His frame was too light to offer much hope for suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess in football, and besides, I was captain of the track</seg><seg type="columnLine">team that year, so I persuaded him to come out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance running. He had a little latent ability and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogged perseverance and a willingness to heed coaching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of which enabled me to make a fair two-miler out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him. He won his letter just before my graduation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he swore eternal gratitude. His being, in a way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a protege of mine probably accounted for the desul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory correspondence we had carried on ever since.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our letters were never long but at least each knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the other was, and when I came to return to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States, he was the only one of my old friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom I could locate. Fourteen years in South America</seg><seg type="columnLine">will get a man pretty well out of touch with his friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could recall Bob Jerningham faintly, but little more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the name and a few facts remained in my memory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob had been a graduate student during three of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">four years in college and he had not lived at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraternity house. He had some kind of a research fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowship in mathematics and had spent his time mooning</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the mathematical library and the astronomi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal observatory, and had only shown up at the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">for supper about once a month. When he did so, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head was so far in the clouds that he showed little or</seg><seg type="columnLine">no interest in our mundane affairs. I remembered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and Tom had been rather close friends, their inti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">macy being no doubt due to their kindred interest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematics, although Jerningham, as I remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, went in for the practical end a little more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wallace did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ride ended before an apartment building on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Park Avenue and I followed Tom through the foyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and up to his rooms. I gasped a little at the mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificence of the furnishings as I entered. It was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that he had indeed made "more money than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what to do with."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now I am ready to talk," he said as the valet took</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hats and coats and disappeared with them. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you remember about Jerningham?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him the little that I had managed to recall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he sat in silence for a few moments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That little won't help much," he said. "I'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you the whole thing.

Or do you use the simpler method</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tea-leaves in a cup?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am neither crazy nor the victim of superstition,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he replied. "I hold no more faith in magic than you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, but at the same time, I tell you calmly and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passionately, that I can foretell the future."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I laughed.

I will admit that we know that we all have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die some time, but we don't realize it. Each person</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks forward with equanimity to the time when his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends or even his loved ones will die, but he can't re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">alize the fact of his own rapidly approaching death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Death, to each of us, seems a thing apart from our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. We don't say so, even in our own minds, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">each in his innermost consciousness fancies himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">immortal and doesn't realize that the death, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows is inevitable for others, is also inevitable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. It is this thought, or rather this internal con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viction of immortality that keeps us going.

I had about ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted my funds, but Jerningham seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of money and he offered to stake me to all ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penses and pay me a pretty good salary if I would work</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his problems.

He would bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a mass of data that he wanted collated and cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logued and curves plotted and calculated from, usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">in polar coordinates, and would leave it to me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrestle with. Sometimes it would take me three months</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get the curve that he wanted.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably read about that, the papers were full of it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I read something about it, but I don't profess to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand it," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a splendid mechanical job," he said, "but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle is not hard to grasp. It consists of a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of variable speed electric motors, whose speed is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled by arms attached to them ending in pointers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By moving a pointer attached to the control arm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the motor along a curve plotted out to scale, the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the motor is made to vary according to the value of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ordinates of the curve. If you have an operator</seg><seg type="columnLine">to each curve you are using, each operator can vary</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed of one of the motors according to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinates of the curve before him. Thus you will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of motors, each running with a speed pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portionate to the value of the ordinates of a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve. It is necessary to synchronize the movements</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the operators so that the abscissa value of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve will be the same at any given moment. Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That much seems simple enough," I admitted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Each of these motors has its separate influence on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a central pointer which is extended or retracted ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to the combined speed of all of the individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors, and which, as it moves along a sheet of paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same abscissa speed as is being used on the pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mary curves, plots a curve which is the resultant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">primary curves. What I have described is the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its simplest operation of adding a series of simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">"FUTILITY"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">321</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">taneous curves. By making slight modifications, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more of the curves can be subtracted while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others are being added, or, by further complications, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the curves may be made to multiply or divide the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others which may in turn be adding, subtracting, mul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiplying or dividing one another, according to the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">the robot is set. Am I making myself clear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I begin to have some idea of it," I replied. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds practicable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Practicable ? It's in daily operation," he said. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only the second step in Jerningham's program. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had got that far by the end of my second graduate year</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was then that he suggested that we leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">University where we were rather restricted in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">work and come here to New York where we could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more independent. I was interested by this time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he offered me the same terms that he had offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">me at college--that is, my expenses and a fair salary</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I came with him. We established ourselves with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus in a building which he rented and went ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our experiments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the end of another year we had constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a machine that would handle a hundred separate var-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iables at one time, performing any operations with any</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve that we wished. One great improvement that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">made was that we eliminated the need for an operator</seg><seg type="columnLine">for each curve. One man could do the whole job. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition to adding, subtracting, multiplying and divid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the robot would extract any desired root or raise to</seg><seg type="columnLine">any desired power or would apply any natural or</seg><seg type="columnLine">transcendental function to them. That was the part</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I worked out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We got the machine ready and tried it out. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked perfectly and then Jerningham announced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would have to quit.

I had a little money saved from the salary</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had paid me and I put this at his service</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was too little to make a great amount of differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. While we were arguing about what we would do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I received word that an uncle of mine had died and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left me about twelve thousand dollars and I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hand that over to Bob. He refused to take it at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he knew that it was all that I had and he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see no immediate commercial value to his machine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then it was that I got my great idea which cursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">both our lives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I suggested that we put our robot to a practical use.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since we were both convinced by this time that every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing happened according to natural laws as the product</seg><seg type="columnLine">of certain variables, I suggested that we cease work on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine itself and devote our time to determining</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the rates of change of variables that we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to monetary profit.

When we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the data in usable shape, we ran it through the pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dictograph and obtained a curve which was supposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show the variations in the price of these stocks for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next year. One of them was not so very active,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so we let it go and concentrated our attention on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other one. We weren't quite broke, so we devoted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next three months to minor refinements in our calcu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lations, meanwhile watching the ticker and checking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on our curve. It proved to be absolutely accurate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we were ready to start our financial operations."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is one thing that I don't understand," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke in. "I can easily understand how you could cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culate the price which your stock ought to sell at</seg><seg type="columnLine">from your data, but I don't see how you managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take account of the actions of the buyers and sellers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In other words, it seems to me that you have left</seg><seg type="columnLine">human nature out of your calculations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We didn't leave it out. It was one of the eighty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">three variables that we considered.

The remaining one</seg><seg type="columnLine">per cent didn't affect the market enough to vitiate our</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve. I'll describe later some of the troubles we en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered when we attacked the problem of the lone</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual.

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked the matter over and decided to make a lot right</seg><seg type="columnLine">away or go broke, so we dug up a broker who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">let us stretch our margin out pretty thin and we piled</seg><seg type="columnLine">our whole lot on our chosen stock and sat back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for things to happen. They happened all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly as our curve predicted and we made money fast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the stock rose, we pyramided. When it was due for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small setback, we would sell enough to get our margin</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a firm basis and ride the depression out. When a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big retrogession was due, we would sell out and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sell short and whipsaw the market going and coming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We kept this up for several months and then took our</seg><seg type="columnLine">profits which amounted to about two hundred thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars and went back to our work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We didn't want ever to be financially embarrassed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, so our first task was to determine and calculate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the variable on a bunch of selected stocks which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">give us wider latitude for our operations. We dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carded the less active ones, but we accumulated data</seg><seg type="columnLine">on thirty and went back to the market.

One thing happened that alarmed us</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a short time. Twenty-nine of our stocks behaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to specifications, but one didn't. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we checked back, we ascertained the cause. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due to my carelessness in misplacing a decimal in</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculating one of the primary curves and not to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">fault of the machine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't the war interfere with your work?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. We tried to enlist in the army early in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game, but they wouldn't have either of us.

That was where we ran into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">variable of human nature in the individual but Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally solved the problem.

We found that they were divided up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups which interacted upon and affected one another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The number in a group ran from twelve to ninety-one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were twenty-two groups. Our method was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtain a resultant curve for each group and then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grand resultant from the twenty-two.

When we got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve finished, it showed his early death. We watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trial pretty closely and when he was acquitted, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt pretty sick. However, less than two weeks later</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was shot to death, presumably by some gangster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as near as we could determine, we had hit the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his death to the fraction of a second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That encouraged us, but we wanted more cases.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We obtained them through the courtesy of a hospital</seg><seg type="columnLine">who allowed us to take readings on certain of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">patients, with the patient's consent, of course. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">made twenty calculations and in every case where our</seg><seg type="columnLine">prediction showed an early death, it happened on</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheduled time.

Mabel</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone. I asked where, and when I was told, I nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fainted. She had left on the flyer that evening for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago, en route to Honolulu. I couldn't get any</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction out of her landlady except that her 'boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend had sent her a ticket and told her to come.' I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to wonder if we were really as smart as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought we were about beating fate.

He had had a four-hour lay-over in Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cago and he had apparently taken a taxi in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill time.

I thought she would take the first one, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wired her in care of it and told her what had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Bob and told her to read his last letter and be guided</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the advice he had given her in it about staying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York for a while.

I saw then that there was no use in</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to stop her. especially as she had waited and sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wire just before the boat was due to sail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*Â«T)OB didn't recover consciousness for a week and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> XJ when he did he was too weak to stand a shock, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't tell about Mabel.

It never</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to me to censor or even look at the daily paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he saw it and as it happened, there wasn't a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the one I saw. The nurse brought him a dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent one and there, on the front page, was a head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined account of Mabel's death. She had talked a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal on the voyage and the reporters had got hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the romantic angle of the affair and her death by</seg><seg type="columnLine">ptomaine poisoning was news therefore.

He hadn't told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her where she was to die, but he told her that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving for Honolulu and told her to follow him in ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">days after he left. He had enclosed a check for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">expenses. Whether the girl misunderstood him or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether she paid no attention to the part of the letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling her when to come, no one will ever know, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the facts were that she had hustled off to Honolulu on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fastest trains and boats that she could connect</seg><seg type="columnLine">with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The police found Bob's letter and also the wire that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had sent her at San Francisco and they had wired</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington of their suspicions and asked that Federal</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrants be issued for both of us. The Department of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Justice soon located us and the warrants were for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warded to Chicago and we were both arrested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fortunately my wire had been so worded that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was really nothing to hold me on, except possibly as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">material witness and I was admitted to bail and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to go back to the hospital and keep an eye on Bob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He recovered slowly and I wished that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">recover even more slowly for he was pronounced fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for travel too soon to suit me.

The day that the surgeon said he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be discharged was two days before we had figured out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would die in Ohio.

The Department</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Justice men told us that we would both be taken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington for a preliminary hearing before being sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Hawaii for trial.

It seemed like a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of dirigible car made of glass and there was a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing inside it and staring at us.

He stopped abruptly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps I shouldn't discuss this with you, Metters,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.

I am going to back up his story, whether or not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the commission chooses to believe what I relate. I feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I must talk of it, if only for my own sake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A three-day search revealed Claxon's Waco piled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a mesa in the hills near San Bernardino. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed beyond recognition, and, still strapped in as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was when came out of the barrel, was Claxon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken body. An ambulance hauled the remains back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the city where the broken-hearted and bewildered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sails assisted in the funeral arrangements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning I ordered a supercharger from Los</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angeles, which came by plane three hours later. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightfall I had installed the apparatus on my ship. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next day I consoled Sails as best I could and took off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I cruised all morning and set down at San Diego for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">oil	and gas. That afternoon I climbed to eighteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet and leveled off. Nothing was in sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I flew until twilight before I set down again at Poppy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Field. Sails came out to meet me as I taxied up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hangar. He wished to go with me the next day. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not rest for thinking of the phantom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We searched the sky of California for three weeks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last we gave it up and shook our heads in despair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For all we knew, the phantom might have been near us</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred times, because, as Sails had explained, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent and could hardly be detected in the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weeks passed before I began to think seriously of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incident. I had tried to attribute Sails' story to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirages. I tried to invent a thousand excuses for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">having such a vision. I attributed it to shell shock in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war, optical illusions, or the fact that he was hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the real facts of Claxon's crash. I left San Bernardino</seg><seg type="columnLine">early in April and went to Seattle. The weather was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rougher than I expected, so I packed up and started for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Los Angeles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Phantom Ship</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER the incident at Poppy Field I always flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a high altitude. I was flying a Hamilton with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Â» extra long wings and slow landing speed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship was capable of one hundred and fifty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">per hour under full load. When I left Seattle I shipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">my baggage to Los Angeles by express and in its place</seg><seg type="columnLine">I filled my fuel tanks to capacity. I had decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the southern city in one hop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I climbed to thirteen thousand feet before I leveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">off to look down upon a storm torn array of forests</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was rapidly being obscured by thick, black clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed to come from every direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was thankful to Allah that I had chosen the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, for the flying was smooth and I was comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. I had that feeling of independence which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubly wonderful to the aviator. I could turn wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">I pleased and stay as long as I wished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I crossed the California-Oregon line at nine thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. It was three o'clock in the afternoon and the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shining only in spots. I climbed to nineteen thou-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sand feet before leveling off. Then I sat back to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supercharger do its work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  My ceiling was as clear as a crystal. Rifts of clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscured my view of the earth. I had Dunsmuir in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. I thought of getting my bearings there by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hotel Travelers, which I knew to face directly south.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I was afraid of the mountains. So I climbed again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and approximated my position by my speed and wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowance and the drift indicator. When I leveled off</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was shivering from cold. The altimeter showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-seven thousand feet. In trying to divert my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind from the penetrating cold up there, I finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of Sails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR weeks I had been trying to attribute his story</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a mirage or a reflection in the glass enclosure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his big International. But I could not forget the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Claxon had really crashed the Waco. I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to be so unfaithful as to believe Sails had fabri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated the story. Suddenly I was conscious of some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing a few hundred yards forward and below me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to look at it. It was the most amazing sight I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever saw or expect to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a great transparent object the length of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean going steamer. When I say transparent I mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was as clear as glass, so clear that it did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflect the sun that shone upon it. It was shaped like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dirigible, but it was not the conventional type of air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. It was oval (fitting Sails' description of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object he had encountered), like a great fish turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its side. On its bottom, which I could see because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its transparency, was a cabin, perhaps seventy feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, in which I could see two people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WAS astounded, to say the least. I could not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve the giant ship was an instrument of man. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed like a fantastic object from another planet;</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps from Mars. But I knew that to be impossible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I swung closer and cut my motor to the idling point and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered above, thinking that I would pass onward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">be compelled to turn in order to get another view of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I discovered that it was moving about the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed as my own ship. I noticed that the two people</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a man and a woman. Suddenly the man looked up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">up through perhaps forty feet of whatever his ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was built of, and stared at me frantically. His hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot out to an object which I took to be a switch. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ship started gathering speed. I did not wish to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose an opportunity for a great adventure. My wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">were almost rolling on his upper surface. When I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the nose of his ship was farther ahead than it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I had dropped over him, I dipped and felt my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels touch something hard. I shoved the stick for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and placed it in a becket. Then I opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. Peering out, I saw that I had landed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the phantom. I left the motor running at twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and climbed nervously out on top. My eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell upon a ladder that presumably led down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. I walked with light steps to it, grasped the sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port and looked down. The bottom of the ladder was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a room in the long cabin, which by this time I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see was filled with different objects, most of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SPACE HERMIT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">329</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were made of the transparent material which formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. The man watched me closely as I started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb down. When I had reached safety below the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of what I supposed was the gas bag, his hand shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the switch. The great ship gave a lurch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled quickly over. Before I realized what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened I saw my Hamilton slide from its landing place</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flutter and spin on its way to the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I suddenly felt my shoulders, thinking of my para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chute. I had left it in the cabin of my plane. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone with two people whom I had never seen. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be two remarkable people; they again might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">two maniacs. I decided to face the adventure in good</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits and climbed on down the ladder until I felt my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet touch something solid. I looked about for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people I had seen. The woman had disappeared, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man stood there facing me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE was about forty years old. His face was clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaven and his features were nobly formed. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair was long about the temples and gray as if it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly turned so. He was six feet tall and well pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portioned. His mouth was firm, and his deep blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes seemed to pierce my very soul. I tried to speak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally I managed to say something in the way of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apology.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sorry to have intruded, Sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drew a deep breath, still looking at me as if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a child and helpless in his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I too am sorry, my friend, that I was compelled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy your airplane," he answered, "but it was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary. Please follow me." He led the way into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cabin and pointed to a transparent chair. A table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three feet wide and six in length stood between us. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were teacups of glass and a plate of some mealy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white and yellow substance, which I supposed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may refresh yourself," he said politely. "For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time I am engaged." He bowed and hurried into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next room. I felt a sudden lurch of the ship as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she were gathering way. I looked below me at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. It was receding farther and farther away. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going at a terrific speed. Then, when my host</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished his arrangements, he came into the cabin, pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lever above his head, and sat down to watch me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have not tasted the food?" he suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whereupon I tried to smile and reluctantly tasted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dish. It had a peculiar taste as if it were blended from</seg><seg type="columnLine">several foods. I consumed the contents of the dish with</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident enjoyment, even under the strain of evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful scrutiny by my host. I drank from the cup,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was not tea that I drank. When the simple meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finished, I lighted a cigaret and took several quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffs while he watched me, seemingly amused. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the cue to my attempt at conversation. He de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clined my offer of a smoke, settled himself in his chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not know where to begin, Captain," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Though this is an intrusion, I am curious to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">about you and this strange craft. Must I attribute this</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery to your genius ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Â«TT is mine," he said proudly. "I built it. It is per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">X feet. You had better remove your flying suit, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temperature is adjusted here." He pointed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument board upon which were a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">switches, levers and dials. I noted the thin linen suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wore and proceeded to take off my own heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing. Strangely enough, I was thinking of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, who was now concealed behind a drawn shade</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the forward end of the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally my host asked thoughtfully, "What is hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pening on earth? Is there a new president of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">country ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was amazed, but I answered him with studied non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chalance, "The same one--another term," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought as much," was his only comment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean the silent one," I explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded as if he understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would like to know something of your life here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain," I urged. "This is all so very strange to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it is fantastic." I indicated the craft in general.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By what right do you ask to know of my life?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the Captain. "You have no right to be aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My apology, Captain," I answered sheepishly. "At</seg><seg type="columnLine">least I cannot leave unless you wish to see me die a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible death. I lost a friend by your ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked off through the wall of the cabin into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western sky. A great sadness seemed to come over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "I wish death to no one," he said. He arose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paced the floor for several minutes. Then he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me and said firmly, "You shall never leave this ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir. It will be well for you to resign yourself to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate--particularly since it will not be uncomfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You choose to keep me aboard, even against my</seg><seg type="columnLine">will!" I demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You came of your own accord," he said calmly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking me squarely in the eyes. "I cannot release</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. I have my own reasons for that. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you shall be comfortable at all times, if you give me</seg><seg type="columnLine">your word of honor that you will never try to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">my craft to earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if I do not give you my word of honor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you do not--if you dare violate the hospitality</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have forced me to bestow upon you--I shall over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come you and force you to abide by my wishes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was in a perplexing position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In that case, I promise you I shall never interfere</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your plans," I said, a little relieved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He extended his hand and I took it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, Mr. Metters," he said radiantly. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shall proceed to explain all this to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We both sat down.

You may think it strange that I have that philos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ophy and still accomplish what to you seems fantastic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">great--impossible. I myself look upon these things I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have invented as mere playthings. That is why I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">renounced the world. I care not for the material pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessions for which you struggle. I want only peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silence. Why, I look down there now and see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes and growth in your cities, the long lines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">concrete pavement that stretch across your nation, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamships and airplanes at which you marvel, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not care to know of them. I remain as far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">your turbid world as possible. I hope I shall never be</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliged to communicate with the earth again, which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say that I shall be buried in the air. Do not marvel</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that. Neither should yoq. marvel at this airship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This ship is five hundred feet in length, eighty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide amidships, and is perhaps forty-five feet high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which includes the cabin. It is built of transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel, the discovery of which I made while experiment-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with machinery for taking substance from the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had already discovered the means of taking palatable</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and water from the air, not to mention the salt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all other requirements of the human body. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery of the metal of which this ship is built, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that it was as hard and tough as steel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighter than aluminum. I therefore built my electro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic motors of this material. They, too, are trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent, save for the parts of copper and iron which</seg><seg type="columnLine">constitute the electro-magnets. The gas bag is built of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same material, with many girders running cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise and lengthwise of the bag. It is filled with helium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I have also succeeded in taking from the air. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a machine for the purpose of making each. There-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, when your friend crashed into me near the Mohave</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert and broke a dangerous hole in the forward end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bag, I gained altitude as quickly as possible. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the necessary amount of what you may call trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent aluminum and the necessary repair. I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the gas in that particular cell was slightly heavier</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the other from the onrush of air when the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck. So I turned to my faithful machine for ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracting helium from the air, and I filled it. I tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can do anything with air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps you wonder why I choose to keep my</seg><seg type="columnLine">work a secret.

As it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, I can rest here above the clouds, assured that no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows or cares where I am, and this solitude is what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I most desire. The woman you saw a moment ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">is my daughter.

I took my daughter with me, and hid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a valley in Missouri. Summer came with the proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">density of air to assist my metal-making machine, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went to work. After six months' labor I succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in finishing the*bag structure. Then I built the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath and installed all these machines. The motors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this craft are forward, in the nose. They are silent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are ten of them, but they drive a single propeller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is thirty feet in diameter. The electricity neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary for operating the motors is generated by auxiliary</seg><seg type="columnLine">propellers and a dynamo, which supply exceeds the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mands. I have perpetual motion, if I desire. I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruise at ten miles an hour or two hundred. I have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag so constructed that it resists wind pressure. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strongest ship in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Â«T)UT after having started the building of my ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">.D I found that I had many curious visitors about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was at a loss as to what to tell them. I finally decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say that I was experimenting, and that should any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the way of an explosion occur, they must not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be surprised, and that instruction for the disposal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my belongings in such a case were unnecessary, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no friends or relatives who would be interested.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These people accepted my alarm with fear and dread.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I never saw a single person after that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My daughter was the little soldier always. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked with me, helped me build this craft in its en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirety. It is named for her, the "Glorie." I shall speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of her later. Suffice to say that you must never</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak to her nor must you ever come nearer her than</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are now. She has finally caught the spell of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence of the sky, and she is happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But let me go back to my story. When we finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in completing this ship, which may seem un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">believable to you, we were at a loss to know how we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should escape from the earth unseen. I recalled hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing told the people of a possible impending explosion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So on the night of our take-off I arranged a huge charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nitroglycerin in the scraps of material which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. I set a long fuse and fired it. We simply got</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cabin and took control, cast off the moorings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappeared into the sky. Perhaps the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">down there in that country think I was a maniac. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not know what was reported--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The papers told of an eccentric building--a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass house, it was described by the natives," I cut in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They related a story of being warned, and of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened one night by the explosion which supposedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed you and your structure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He smiled as if he were greatly pleased at this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have never touched earth since. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruised over the entire surface of the globe. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accident which killed your friend we have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the Pacific and on to Russia. I do not really</seg><seg type="columnLine">know my bearings now--and I don't care.

"Yes, I am right, Metters. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">do I wish to hear a single criticism from you again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you understand that ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I assured him I did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He arose and looked off into the clouds His hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought a door knob.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was hoarse and scarcely audible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He closed the door softly and locked me in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Then he went to the instrument board and</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed a switch or two. I felt the rush of heavy air</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my cabin and wondered at its warmth. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dial and pulled another switch, upon which move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment the great "Glorie" rolled slightly, her bow lifted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she gathered speed in the darkness of my first</seg><seg type="columnLine">night aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Cabin of the Glories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next few hours constituted the most weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience of my life, over which I look with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeling of humility and utter unimportance. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thought that my vocation as an aviator afforded me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the respect of science and the world at large, until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to assume that I was a pioneer and a leader of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Yet, fearless as I had been all my life, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been awe-stricken or fascinated by my work. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, everything I did seemed routine-like and ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary, even to stepping into space from an airplane which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had conked and dropping ten thousand feet to earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And once I dodged bullets from a machine gun for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours at a time. I had seen the works of science and</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention and read the words of wise philosophers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not one of these, even in its deepest meaning, was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant after I found myself in the cabin of the Glorie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The people of the earth, all the things of the earth, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came simple and ordinary, meaningless nothings. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attitude into which Captain Hedron had initiated</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again, as the great ship sped on her way through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                 r</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the trackless wastes of the upper strata, I wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how one could be happy without experiencing the trials</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth. I thought of the girl, the captain's daugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, and wondered if she really wished to be with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father here where she could not dance and dress and</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoy the beautiful things of life. I wondered--far into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night. Then the captain came and sat with me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain in his own philosophical way the fascinating</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysteries which surrounded me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have not changed our natures since leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world Metters," he said "We, like all human beings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are bound to the craving for the new and to the love</seg><seg type="columnLine">and respect for the old.

You will hear my daughter play before</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. However, I trust you will abide by my wishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and never speak to her.

And I thought of the material side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my adventure, the world renown and riches which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would reward the inventor of such machinery as I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hope I can be forgiven, but I really started that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment on a train of thought, which seemed a breach</seg><seg type="columnLine">of confidence. I wondered about the possibility of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealing these things to the world; I wondered whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not I could induce the professor to land his craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the startled eyes of millions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Hedron dropped to an altitude of thirteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet and gave me a view of Paris but, know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing there were many aircraft operating in the vicinity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he immediately climbed again, and the outlines of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city were lost behind clouds. I believe that was my</seg><seg type="columnLine">last sight of Paris. I do not know. We remained at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a high altitude for weeks. I was alone for the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the time. Professor Hedron ignored me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once he startled me with the announcement that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were over the north pole, only to say five days later</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were cruising over the Argentine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My food came through a tube from the machine. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could eat at will, for there were no hours. Time meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to the professor, but the monotony wore on</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I felt myself becoming queer. Then I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder how he and his daughter could withstand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loneliness of the upper strata in a glasslike cage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where there were no flowers and trees, no variety save</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different view of the moon and stars. There was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even variety in the weather. One of the machines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the professor had so deftly made of that strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, adjusted the temperature in the cabin. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not venture from my cabin until I had been aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">two weeks. When I did fare forth into the main cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the strange organ was located, I found nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the same glassy deck, the same emptiness that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost driven me mad. But a strange incident took</seg><seg type="columnLine">place while I was there. I suddenly saw the curtains</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SPACE HERMIT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">333</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the girl's cabin being raised, and I looked upon a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle, it seemed to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GLORIE was in her early twenties when I first</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw her. She was white and beautiful with brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair that had been allowed to grow and fall about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. Even here where she had been cramped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for three solid years, she moved gracefully as she came</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward me. Our eyes met as she came down the aisle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opened the door leading to the main cabin. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching her with the deepest curiosity. She closed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and stood looking at me, and it seemed that a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of great relief came into her face. I read in her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the emptiness of her life. I knew at that moment that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did not wish to be aboard the airship. I swear I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw her very soul, the soul of a person who was en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely immune from earthly temptations, but who hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered for the things that nature meant her to have--</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes and friends and flowers and trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I dared not speak to her. I waited for what seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages for her to move on. and yet I did not wish her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go. I wanted to talk with her, despite the orders of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father. Perhaps he had warned her, for she finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">did turn away. She tripped across the deck, gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the filmy gown she wore, and seated herself at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">organ. She cast one more glance at me, a look that</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have made us both happy, and then she played</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had never heard any one play before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the song of a far-off planet, a weird and beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful tune that struck my heart like a bullet and sent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood to my brain. It was fantastic and soul stirring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it seemed to tell of the infinite of which we so</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruitlessly dream. It sent my imagination to other</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets beside our own; it brought pictures of war</seg><seg type="columnLine">and destruction, putting me in mind of Mars. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered something else that seemed to fit the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and the music she played. It was a battle be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween my plane and another plane, over the German</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines in 1918, the weird drone of death dealing-mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters that winged their way through the clouds. I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">always associate the two experiences, for they both</seg><seg type="columnLine">teemed with mystery and fantasy, for men did not seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">real when they flew out to fight. Then the music broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, as if the life of its maker had been snuffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the great battle that is always going on in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">human heart. Glorie looked at me again, her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaming with joy. She looked at me for two minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">without changing her expression, and then her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought the invisible keys again. She seemed to read</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind and to know the music that drew the deepest</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentiment from my heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she played "Mother Machree." Can you im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agine that tune at an altitude of thirty thousand feet, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an airship traveling at the speed of two hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">per hour, and yet going to no place ? The impossibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it impressed me. It was not right. That woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not happy, never could be there. I was deciding</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do something about it when a strong hand grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulder and I turned to face the professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shall never forget his face at that moment. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great rage that had overcome him ,and I attributed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his anger to the tune Glorie had played. Before I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could speak, he pointed to the door. I looked again</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his daughter and saw her staring at me, wild eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and helpless and hurt. Then I went to my own cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw him caress the hand of his daughter as she sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, watched him turn with tears in his eyes and go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the control room. Then I made my final de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision to break my word of honor to him. Nor would</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ask him to release me. To him that would mean only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing. I did not even think of whit Glorie might</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of me for breaking my word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For three days I studied the actions of the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he maneuvered the ship about the skies. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I gained an appreciable knowledge about the hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling of the craft. I learned that one of the levers</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulated the elevators, that another increased the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of the great invisible propeller at the nose. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that the turning of a dial set in motion the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">which forced the food that I ate through the tube which</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended in my cabin. Another lever he used to bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. This lever worked on the same principle as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane control stick and lowered and raised the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">fins at the side. Thus I gained my knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">working of the ship. I decided to put that knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use immediately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Strange Tomb</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE helpless look in Glorie's eyes told me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth. She had been forced by her eccentric</seg><seg type="columnLine">father to remain a prisoner on the airship. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been powerless all those three years, to induce</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to return to the earth. I decided it was for me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">release her from her phantom prison. But I knew I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be cautious. Professor Hedron was a powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in both mind and body. I did not wish to injure</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, nor to have the disrespect of his daughter. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I acquired control of the ship by stealth and bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with strips torn from my clothes, that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak to her. That was the course I decided to follow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two weeks later, as I reckoned time, we lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a maze of fog somewhere in the tropics. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mid-day, in the sweltering heat of the sun. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor seemed to have no control over intense heat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor did altitude appear to solve the problem. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">enraged him. He turned the craft about and headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">north. My next view of the earth came one evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">four days later. We were cruising slowly when I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the main cabin and looked through the telescope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From her own room Glorie watched me closely--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought with intense speculation. I decided that moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to defer my plan of action any longer. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope did not reveal our position. We were over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great plain, and about us, as far as we could see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a haze that reached into the sky like a great en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulfing tide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I left the telescope nonchalantly and turned to pacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck. Still Glorie watched me. I tried to face her</seg><seg type="columnLine">squarely and found it impossible. She must have de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected my purpose at that moment, for her eyes widened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she smiled upon me when I looked again. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitiful, wistful smile, like that of a child that wishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">something for which it dares not ask. I smiled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Continued on page 369)</seg><seg type="columnLine">'The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&amp; ICE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jBy Jules Verne</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Concluding the Sequel to "The English at the North Pole."</seg><seg type="columnLine">What Went Before:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">JjlCHARD SHANDON receives a letter signed "K.Z.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Captain of the Forward" offering him the post of chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">*- officer, on a new brig, giving him full instructions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient funds for the building of the vessel.

Hot air produces perspiration, which pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tects the skin, but boiling water scalds. The maximum</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat of baths is 107Â°, so that this Turk must have been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an extraordinary fellow to endure such temperature."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What is the mean temperature, Dr. Clawbonny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of animated beings?" asked Johnson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That varies with the species," replied the Doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Birds have the highest, especially the duck and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hen. The mammalia come next, and then human be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings; the temperature of Englishmen averages 98.5Â°."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am sure Mr. Altamont is going to claim a higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate for his countrymen," said Johnson, smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, sure enough, we've some precious hot ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">among us, but, as I never have put a thermometer</seg><seg type="columnLine">down their throats to ascertain, I can't give you sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tistics."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no sensible difference," said the Doctor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"between men of different races when they are placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the same conditions, whatever their food may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. I may almost say their temperature would be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same at the Equator as at the Pole."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then the heat of our bodies is the same here as in</seg><seg type="columnLine">England," replied Altamont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just about it. The other species of mammalia are</seg><seg type="columnLine">generally hotter than human beings. The horse, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hare, the elephant, the porpoise, and the tiger are</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly the same; but the cat, the squirrel, the rat, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panther, the sheep, the ox, the dog, the monkey and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the goat, are as high as 103Â°; and the pig is 104Â°.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Rather humiliating to us," put in Altamont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then come the amphibia and the fish," resumed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor, "whose temperature varies with that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. The serpent has a temperature of 80Â°, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frog 70Â°, and the shark several degrees less.

I think it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be far more seasonable to speak of cold, if the Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">could tell us what is the lowest temperature on record ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I can enlighten you on that too," replied the Doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor. "There are a great number of memorable winters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which appear to have come at intervals of about forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one years. In 1364, the Rhone was frozen over as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Arles; in 1408, the Danube was frozen through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out its entire extent, and the wolves crossed the Catte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gat on firm ground; in 1509, the Adriatic and the Med-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iterranean were frozen at Venice and Marseilles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Baltic on the 10th of April; in 1608, all the cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">died in England from the cold; in 1789, the Thames</seg><seg type="columnLine">was frozen as far as Gravesend; and the frightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter of 1813 will long be remembered in France.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The earliest and longest ever known in the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">century was in 1829.

The "Doctor's House" stood out well, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fying storm and tempest, and the snow only seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase the thickness of the walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The storehouses, too, did not give way in the least;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but though they were only a few yards off, it was found</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to lay in enough provisions for the day, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">very often the weather made it almost impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The unloading of the Porpoise turned out to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a wise precaution, for she was slowly but surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">being crushed to pieces by the silent, irresistible pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure around her. Still the Doctor was always hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough planks might be sufficiently sound to construct</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small vessel to convey them back to England; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right time to build had not yet come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The five men were consequently compelled to spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greater part of the day in complete idleness. Hat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teras lolled on his bed, absorbed in thought. Altamont</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoked or dozed, and the Doctor took care not to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turb either of them, for he was in perpetual fear of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarrel between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At meal times he always led the conversation away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from irritating topics, and sought, as far as possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to instruct and interest all parties. Whenever he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not engaged with the preparation of his notes, he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">them dissertations on history, geography, or meteor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ology, handling his subject in an easy, though philo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sophical manner, drawing lessons from the most trivial</seg><seg type="columnLine">incidents. His inexhaustible memory was never at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loss for fact or illustration, while his good humor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and geniality made him the life and soul of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">company. He was implicitly trusted by all, even by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatteras, who cherished a deep affection for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet no man felt the compulsory confinement more</seg><seg type="columnLine">painfully than Clawbonny.

But to reconcile</seg><seg type="columnLine">an American and an Englishman was no easy task. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Johnson had many a talk on the subject, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old sailor's views quite coincided with his own as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difficult complications which awaited them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, the bad weather continued, and leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fort Providence, even for an hour, was out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question. Day and night they were pent up in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering icewalls, and time hung heavily on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, at least on all but the Doctor's, and he always</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to find some occupation for himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I declare," said Altamont one evening, "life like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is not worth having!

The Doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor left his desk and Johnson his cooking, and hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their captain's side, supposing he wanted to talk over</seg><seg type="columnLine">their perilous situation; but Hatteras never gave it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My friends," he said, "let us take advantage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American's absence to speak of business. There are</seg><seg type="columnLine">things which cannot concern him, and with which I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wish him to meddle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnson and Clawbonny looked at each other, won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering what the captain was driving at.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish," he continued, "to talk with you about our</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans for the future."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right; talk away," said the Doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a month, or six weeks at the outside, the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for making distant excursions will come again. Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you thought of what we had better undertake in</seg><seg type="columnLine">summer ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you, captain?" asked Johnson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have I? I may say that not an hour of my life</seg><seg type="columnLine">passes without revolving in my mind my one cherished</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose. I suppose not a man among you intends to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace his steps?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one replied, and Hatteras went on to say:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For my own part, even if I must go alone, I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">push on to the North Pole. Never were men so near</seg><seg type="columnLine">it before, for we are not more than 360 miles distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">at most; and I will not lose such an opportunity with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out making every attempt to reach it, even though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">be an impossibility. What are your views, Doctor?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your own, Hatteras."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yours, Johnson?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like the Doctor's."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yours, Bell?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain," replied the carpenter, "it is true we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither wives nor children waiting us in England, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, it is one's country--one's native land! Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you no thoughts of returning home?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can return after we have discovered the Pole</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite as well as before, and even better. Our diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culties will not increase, for as we near the Pole we</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away from the point of greatest cold. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel and provisions enough.

Then the Doctor aske how he proposed they</seg><seg type="columnLine">should go?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the coast, as far as possible," was the reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what if we find open water, as is likely enough ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we'll go across it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we have no boat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatteras did .not answer, and looked very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">embarrassed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps," suggested Bell, "we might make a boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of some of the planks of the Porpoise</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Never!" exclaimed Hatteras, vehemently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never!" said Johnson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor shook his head. He understood the feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never!" reiterated Hatteras. "A boat made out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an American ship would be an American!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But captain--" began Johnson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor made a sign to the old boatswain not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">press the subject further, and resolved in his own mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reserve the question for discussion at a more op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portune moment. He managed to turn the conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">to other matters, till it abruptly terminated by the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance of Altamont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This ended the day, and the night passed quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">without the least disturbance. The bears had evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Imprisoned in Doctor's House</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE first business next day was to arrange for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunt. It was settled that Altamont, Bell, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatteras should form the party, while Clawbonny</seg><seg type="columnLine">should go and explore as far as Johnson Island and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make some hydrographic notes, and Johnson should</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain behind to keep house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three hunters soon completed their preparations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They armed themselves each with a double-barreled</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol and a rifle, and took plenty of powder and bullets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each man also carried- in his belt his indispensable</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow knife and hatchet and a small supply of pem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mican in case night should surprise them before their</seg><seg type="columnLine">return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus equipped, they could go far, and might count</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a good supply of game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At eight o'clock they started, accompanied by Duk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who frisked and gamboled with delight. They went</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the hill to the east, across the cone, and down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plain below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">340</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor next took his departure, after agreeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Johnson on a signal of alarm in case of danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old boatswain was left alone, but he had plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. He began by unfastening the Greenland dogs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and letting them out for a run, after their long, weari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some confinement. Then he attended to divers house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping matters. He had to replenish the stock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">combustibles and provisions, to arrange the store-houses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mend several broken utensils, to repair the rents in</seg><seg type="columnLine">coverlets, and get new shoes ready for summer excur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions. There was no lack of work, and the old sailor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nimble, clever fingers could do anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While his hands were busy, his mind was occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the conversation of the preceding evening. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pondered with regret over the captain's obstinacy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet he felt that there was something grand and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroic in his determination that neither an American</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor an American ship should first touch the Pole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hunters had gone about an hour when Johnson</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly heard the report of a gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Capital!" he exclaimed. "They have found some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, and pretty quickly too, if we can hear their</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns so distinctly. The atmosphere must be very</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A second and a third shot followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bravo!" again exclaimed the boatswain; "they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have fallen in luck's way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when three more shots came in rapid succession,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man turned pale, and a horrible thought crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind which made him rush out and climb hastily to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the cone. He shuddered at the sight which</seg><seg type="columnLine">met his eyes. The three hunters, followed by Duk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tearing home at full speed, followed by the five</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge bears! Their six balls had evidently taken no</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect, and the terrible monsters were close on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels. Hatteras, who brought up the rear, could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage to keep off his pursuers by flinging down one</seg><seg type="columnLine">article after another--first his cap, then his hatchet, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally, his gun. He knew that the inquisitive bears</seg><seg type="columnLine">would stop and examine every object, sniffing all round</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and this gave him a little time. Otherwise he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have escaped, for these animals outstrip the fleetest</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, and one monster was so near that Hatteras had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to brandish his knife vigorously, to ward off a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous blow of his paw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, though panting and out of breath, the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">men reached Johnson safely, and slid down the rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him into the snow-house. The bears stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">short on the upper plateau, and Hatteras and his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions lost no time in barring and barricading them</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here we are at last!" exclaimed Hatteras; "we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">defend ourselves better now. It is five against five."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Four!" said Johnson, in a frightened voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Doctor!" replied Johnson, pointing to the empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting-room. "He is on Johnson's Island."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A bad job for him," said Bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we can't leave him to his fate, in this fashion,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Altamont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No; let's be off to find him at once," replied Hat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teras. He opened the door, but soon shut it, narrowly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">escaping a bear's hug. "They are there!" he exclaimed. '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All?" asked Bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The whole pack."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Altamont rushed to the windows, and began to fill</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the deep embrasure with blocks of ice, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke off the walls of the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His companions followed his example silently. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sound was heard but the low, deep growl of Duk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To tell the simple truth, however, it was not their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own danger that occupied their thoughts, but that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their absent friend, the Doctor. It was for him they</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled, not for themselves. Poor Clawbonny, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">good and devoted as he had been to every member of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little colony! This was the first time they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been separated from him. Extreme peril and most</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely a frightful death awaited him, for he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">return unsuspectingly to Fort Providence, and find</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the power of these ferocious animals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yet," said Johnson, "unless I am much mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken, he must be on guard. Your repeated shots can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not but have warned him. He must surely be aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that something unusual has happened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But suppose he was too far away to hear them,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied Altamont, "or has not understood the cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them? It is ten chances to one but he'll come</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly back, never imagining the danger. The bears</seg><seg type="columnLine">are screened from sight by the crag completely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must get rid of them before he comes," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatteras.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how?" asked Bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was difficult to reply to this, for a sortie was out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the question. They had taken care to barricade the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance passage, but the bears could easily find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way in if they chose. So it was thought advisable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep a close watch on their movements outside, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening attentively in each room, so as to be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">resist all attempts at invasion. They could distinctly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear them prowling about, growling and scraping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls with their enormous paws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, some action must be taken speedily, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">time was passing. Altamont resolved to try a port-hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which he might fire on his assailants. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon scooped out a hole in the wall, but his gun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly pushed through when it was seized with irre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistible force, and wrested from his grasp before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could even fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound it!" he exclaimed, "we're no match for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This state of things had lasted upwards of an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there seemed no prospect of a termination. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">question of a sortie began now to be seriously discussed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was little chance of success, as the bears could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be attacked separately, but Hatteras and his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions had grown so impatient, and it must be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessed were also so much ashamed of being kept in</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison by beasts, that they would even have dared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk, if the captain had not suddenly thought of a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">mode of defense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took Johnson's furnace-poker, and thrust it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stove, while he made an opening in the snow wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rather a partial opening, for he left a thin sheet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice on the outer side. As soon as the poker was red-hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DESERT OF ICE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">341</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lie said to his comrades, who stood eagerly watching</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him, wondering what he was going to do:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"This red-hot bar will keep off the bears when they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">try to get hold of it, and we shall be able easily to fire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">across it without letting them snatch away our guns."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"A good idea," said Bell, posting himself beside Al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tamont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Hatteras withdrew the poker, and instantly plunged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it in the wall. The melting snow made a loud hissing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">noise, and two bears ran and made a snatch at the glow-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing bar; but they fell back with a terrible howl, and at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the same moment four shots resounded, one after the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hit!" exclaimed Altamont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hit!" echoed Bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Let us repeat the dose," said Hatteras, carefully</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stopping up the opening meantime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The poker was again thrust into the fire, and in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few minutes was ready for Hatteras to recommence op-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">erations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Altamont and Bell reloaded their guns, and took their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">â¢	places; but this time the poker would not pass through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Confound the beasts;" exclaimed the impetuous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">American.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What's the matter?" asked Johnson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What's the matter? Why, those plaguey animals</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are piling up block after block, intending to bury us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alive!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Impossible!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Look for yourself; the poker can't get through. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">declare it is getting absurd now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was worse than absurd; it was alarming. Things</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grew worse. It was evident that the bears meant to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stifle their prey, for the sagacious animals were heap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing up huge masses, which would make escape impos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It is too bad," said old Johnson, with a mortified</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">look. "One might put up with men, but bears!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Two hours elapsed without bringing any relief to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the prisoners; to go out was impossible, and the thick</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">walls excluded all sound. Altamont walked impatiently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up and down, full of exasperation and excitement at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">finding himself worsted for once. Hatteras could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">think of nothing but the Doctor, and of the serious peril</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which threatened him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, if Dr. Clawbonny were only here!" said John-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What could he do?" asked Altamont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, he'd manage to get us out somehow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How, pray?" said the American, crossly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"If I knew that, I should not need him. However,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I know what his advice just now would be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"To take some food; that can't hurt us. What do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you say, Mr. Altamont?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, let's eat, by all means, if that will please you,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">though we're in a ridiculous, not to say humiliating</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'll bet you we'll find a way out after dinner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">No one replied, but they seated themselves round</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the table. Johnson, trained in Clawbonny's school,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tried to be brave and unconcerned about the danger, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he could scarcely manage it. His jokes stuck in his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">throat. Moreover, the whole party began to feel un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">comfortable. The atmosphere was getting dense, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">every opening was hermetically sealed.

I crept cautiously nearer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes going on all-fours, sometimes slipping be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween great blocks of ice, till I came at last quite close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our fort, and then I found the bears working away</seg><seg type="columnLine">like beavers. They were prowling about the snow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dragging enormous blocks of ice towards the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">piling them up like a wall, evidently intending to bury</seg><seg type="columnLine">you alive. It is a lucky thing they did not take it into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads to dash down the blocks from the summit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cone, for then you must have been crushed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitably."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what danger you were in, Dr. Clawbonny,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Bell.

Hatteras, Altamont and Bell hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried out with the guns, but they might spare their shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for four of the bears lay dead, and the fifth, half</seg><seg type="columnLine">roasted, though alive, was scampering away in terror,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fast as his legs could- carry him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurrah!

They em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployed the rest of the day in repairing the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had suffered greatly by the explosion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next morning there was a singular rise in the tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perature, the thermometer going up to 15Â° above zero.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This comparative heat lasted several days. In shel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered spots the glass rose as high as 31Â°, and symptoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a coming thaw appeared. The ice began to crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there, and jets of salt water were thrown up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like fountains in an English park. A few days later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rain fell in torrents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thick vapor rose from the snow, giving promise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speedy disappearance of these immense masses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sun's pale disk became deeper in color, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained longer above the horizon. The night was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely longer than three hours. Other tokens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring's approach became manifest. The birds were</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning in flocks, and the air resounded with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">deafening cries. Hares were seen on the shores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bay, and mice were in such abundance that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">burrows completely honeycombed the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor drew the attention of his companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fact that almost all these animals were begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to lose their white winter dress, and would soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">put on summer attire; and nature was already provid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mosses, and poppies, and saxifrage, and short</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass for their sustenance. A new world lay beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">that melting snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But with their inoffensive animals came back their</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural enemies. Foxes and wolves arrived in search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their prey, and dismal howls broke the silence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">short night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Arctic wolves closely resemble dogs, and their bark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing would deceive the most practiced ears; even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canine race themselves have been deceived by it. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, it seems as if the wily animals employed this</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruse to,attract the dogs, and make them their prey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several navigators have mentioned the fact, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor's own experience confirmed it. Johnson took</seg><seg type="columnLine">care not to let his Greenlanders loose; of Duk there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was little fear--nothing could take him in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For about a fortnight hunting was the principal</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupation. There was an abundant supply of fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat to be had. They shot partridges, ptarmigans, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow ortolans, which are delicious eating. The hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers never went far from Fort Providence, for game</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so plentiful that it seemed awaiting their guns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the whole bay presented an animated appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thaw, meanwhile, was making rapid progress.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thermometer stood steadily at 32Â° above zero, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water ran round the mountain-sides in cataracts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dashed in torrents through the ravines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor lost no time in clearing about an acre</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ground, in which he sowed the seeds of anti-scor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">butic plants. He just had the pleasure of seeing tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">little green leaves begin to sprout, when the cold re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned in full force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In a single night the thermometer lost nearly 40Â°; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down to 8Â° below zero. Everything was frozen;</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds, quadrupeds, amphibia disappeared as if by magic;</seg><seg type="columnLine">seal-holes re-closed, and the ice once more became hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">as granite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The change was most striking; it occurred on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">18th of May, during the night. The Doctor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather disappointed at having all his work to do again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Hatteras bore the grievance most unphilosophically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it interfered with all his plans of speedy departure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think we shall have a long spell of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather, Dr. Clawbonny?" asked Johnson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No, my friend, I don't; it is a last blow from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold.

The old monotonous life indoors recom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced, and was unmarked by any incident except a</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious illness which suddenly attacked Bell. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent quinsy, but, under the Doctor's skillful treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, it was soon cured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During this compulsory leisure, Clawbonny deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to have a talk with the captain on an important</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject--a subject equally important to all--the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DESERT OF ICE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">345</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of a boat out of the planks of the Porpoise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor hardly knew how to begin, as Hatteras</seg><seg type="columnLine">had declared so vehemently that he would never con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to use a morsel of American wood ; yet it was high</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he were brought to reason, as June was at hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only season for distant expeditions, and they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not start without a boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought over it a long while, and at last drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain aside, and said, in the kindest, gentlest</seg><seg type="columnLine">way:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hatteras, do you believe I'm your friend?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Most certainly I do," replied the captain, earnestly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"my best, indeed, my only friend."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if I give you a piece of advice without your</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking, will you consider my motive is perfectly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, for I know you have never been actuated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-interest.

There was no lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood, for, shattered as the old "three-master"</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been by the icebergs, she could still supply the</seg><seg type="columnLine">principal parts of a new ship, and the carpenter began</seg><seg type="columnLine">his task immediately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the end of May the temperature again rose, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring returned for good and all.

At last he might hope to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascertain for himself whether his predecessors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">correct in their assertions about a Polar basin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was a frequent topic of thought and conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation with him, and one evening when he was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">over all the old familiar arguments in support of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory, Altamont took up the subject, and declared his</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion that the polar basin extended west as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">east. But it was impossible for the American and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Einglishman to talk long about anything without</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming to words, so intensely national were both. Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kane was the first bone of contention on this oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casion, for the jealous Englishman was unwilling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grant his rival the glory of being a discoverer, alleging</seg><seg type="columnLine">his belief that though the brave adventurer had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">far north, it was by mere chance he had made a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chance!" interrupted Altamont, hotly.

"Well, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever chance favored anyone it was that McClure. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you pretend to deny it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do," said Hatteras, becoming quite excited. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his courage and perseverance in remaining four</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole winters among the ice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe that, don't I?" said Altamont, sneeringly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He was caught among the bergs and could not get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away; but didn't he after all abandon his ship, the In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigator, and try to get back home? Besides, putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man aside, what is the value of his discovery? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintain that the Northwest Passage is still undis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered, for not a single ship to this day has ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed from Bering Strait to Baffin Bay!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fact was indisputable, but Hatteras started to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will not permit the honor of an English captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be attacked in my presence any longer!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will not permit!" echoed Altamont, also spring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing erect. "But these are facts, and it is out of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">power to destroy them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir!" shouted Hatteras, pale with rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My friends!" interposed the Doctor; "pray be</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm. This is a scientific point that we are discussing."</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Hatteras was deaf to reason now, and said</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll tell you the facts, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And I'll tell you," retorted the irate American.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gentlemen," said Clawbonny, in a firm tone, "al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low me to speak, for I know the facts of the case as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as and perhaps better than you, and I can state</seg><seg type="columnLine">them impartially."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes!" cried Bell and Johnson, who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously watching the strife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, go on," said Altamont, finding himself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minority, while Hatteras simply made a sign of acqui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escence, and resumed his seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor brought a chart and spread it out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, that his auditors might follow his narration in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligibly, and be able to judge the merits of McClure for</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was in 1848," he said, "that two vessels, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herald and the Plover, were sent out in search of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Franklin, but their efforts proving ineffectual, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">others were despatched to assist them--the Investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gator, in command of McClure, and the Enterprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in command of Captain Collinson. The Investigator</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived first in Bering Strait, and without waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her consort, set out with the declared purpose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find Franklin or the Northwest Passage. The gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lant young officer hoped to push north as far as Mel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ville Sound, but just at the extremity of the Strait</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was stopped by an insurmountable barrier of ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forced to winter there. During the long, dreary</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, however, he and his officers undertook a</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey over the ice-field to make sure of its com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municating with Melville Sound."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, but he did not get through," said Altamont.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stop a bit," replied Clawbonny; "as soon as a thaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in, McClure renewed his attempt to bring his ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Melville Sound, and had succeeded in getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">within twenty miles, when contrary winds set in, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged her south with irresistible violence. This de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided the captain to alter his course. He determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go in a westerly direction; but after a fearful struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with icebergs, he stuck fast in the first of the series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">straits which end in Baffin Bay, and was obliged to win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter in Mercy Bay. His provisions would only hold out</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen months longer, but he would not give up. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">set out on a sled, and reached Melville Island, hop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to fall in with some ship or other, but all he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Winter Harbor was a cairn, which contained a docu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, stating that Captain Austin's lieutenant, McClin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tock, had been there the preceding year. McClure re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed this document by another, which stated his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention of returning to England by the Northwest Pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage he had discovered, by Lancaster Sound and Baffin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bay, and that in the event of his not being heard of, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be looked for north or west of Melville Island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he went back to Mercy Bay with undaunted cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, to pass a third winter. By the beginning of March</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stock of provisions was so reduced, in consequence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the utter scarcity of game, through the severity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the season, that McClure resolved to send half his men</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DESERT OF ICE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">347</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to England, either by Baffin Bay or by McKenzie</seg><seg type="columnLine">River and Hudson Bay. The other half would manage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work the vessel to Europe. He kept all his best</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors, and selected for departure only those to whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fourth winter would have been fatal. Everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged for their leaving, and the day fixed, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">McClure, who was out walking with Lieutenant Cras-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, observed a man running towards them, flinging up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms and gesticulating frantically, and on getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer recognized him as Lieutenant Prim, officer on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board the Herald, one of the ships he had parted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Bering Strait two years before. Captain Kellett,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Commander, had reached Winter Harbor, and find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing McClure's document in the cairn, had dispatched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieutenant in search of him. McClure accompanied</seg><seg type="columnLine">him back, and arranged with the captain to send him his</seg><seg type="columnLine">batch of invalids. Lieutenant Craswell took charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these and conveyed them safely to Winter Harbor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leaving them there he went across the ice four hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and seventy miles, and arrived at Beechey Island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, a few days afterwards, he took passage with</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve men on board the Phoenix, and reached London</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely on the 7th of October, 1853, having traversed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole extent between Bering Strait and Cape</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farewell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, if arriving on one side and leaving at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other is not going through, I don't know what is!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, but he went four hundred and seventy miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">over ice-fields," objected Altamont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What of that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything; that is the gist of the whole argument.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not the Investigator that went through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," replied Clawbonny, "for, at the close or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth winter, McClure was obliged to leave her among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, in maritime expeditions the vessel has to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, and not the man; and if ever the Northwest</seg><seg type="columnLine">Passage is practicable, it will be for ships and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sledges.

Hatteras went outside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paced up and down with rapid strides. In about an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hour he came back, and retired to bed without saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">another word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           CHAPTER XVI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           Arctic Arcadia</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the 29th of May, for the first time, the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">never set.

The period was now entered when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day lasts twenty-four hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next morning there was a magnificent halo; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monarch of day appeared surrounded by a luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle radiant with all the prismatic colors. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomenon never lost its charm for the Doctor, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever frequently it occurred, and he always noted care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully all particulars respecting it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before long the feathered tribes began to return,</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling the air with their discordant cries.

On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">15th of June the thermometer stood at 57Â° above</seg><seg type="columnLine">zero.

It was almost com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely thawed, and already the banks were clothed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a species of vegetation, as if the sun had done his best</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fertilize the soil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tell you what," said the Doctor, "a few enterpris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing colonists might make a fine settlement here.

Ah! if I am not much mistaken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has some four-footed inhabitants already.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed against the Doctor's knees, and let him stroke</seg><seg type="columnLine">them till the kind-hearted man could not help saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Altamont:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why give shot to those who come for caresses? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">death of these little beasts could do us no good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say what's true, Clawbonny.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole glen echoed with their joyous cries as they darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to and fro from all parts. The good Doctor seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">some mighty enchanter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hunters had continued their course along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks of the river, when a sudden bend in the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed a herd of deer, eight or ten in number, peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully browsing on some lichens that lay half-buried in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow. They were charming creatures, so graceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gentle, male and female, both adorned with noble</seg><seg type="columnLine">antlers, wide-spreading and deeply-notched. Their skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already lost its winter whiteness, and began to as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sume the brown tint of summer. Strange to say, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared not a whit more afraid than the 'birds or</seg><seg type="columnLine">hares.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three men were now right in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd, but not one made the least movement to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. This time the worthy Doctor had far more diffi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">culty in restraining Altamont's impatience, for the mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of such magnificent animals roused his hunting in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stincts, and he became quite excited; while Hatteras,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the contrary, seemed really touched to see the splen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">did creatures rubbing their heads so affectionately and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trustfully against the good Clawbonny, the friend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">every living thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, I say," exclaimed Altamont, "didn't we come</seg><seg type="columnLine">out expressly to hunt ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To hunt the musk-ox, and nothing else," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clawbonny. "Besides, we shouldn't know what to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this game, even if we killed it; we have provisions</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. Let us for once enjoy the sight of men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals in perfect amity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It proves no human beings have been here be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore," said Hatteras.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True, and that proves something more; these animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not of American origin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you make that out?" said Altamont.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, if they had been born in North America, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have known how to treat that mammiferous biped</seg><seg type="columnLine">called man, and would have fled at the first glimpse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. No, they are from the north, most likely from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">untrodden wilds of Asia; so, Altamont, you have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to claim them as fellow countrymen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh! a hunter doesn't examine his game so closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">as all that. Everything is grist that comes to his mill."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right. Calm yourself, my brave Nimrod! For</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own part. I would rather never fire another shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">than make one of these beautiful creatures afraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. See. even Duk fraternizes with them. Believe me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is well to be kind where we can. Kindness is</seg><seg type="columnLine">power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, well, so be it," said Altamont, not at all un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstanding such scruples. "But I should like to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you would do if you had no weapon but kindness</seg><seg type="columnLine">among a pack of bears or wolves! You wouldn't make</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I make no pretensions to charm wild beasts.

This is true of men as well as animals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They spent the whole day in the glen, which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor christened "Arctic Arcadia," and when evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">came they lay down to rest in the hollow of a rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed to have been expressly prepared for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">accommodation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Altamont's Revenge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEXT morning, as the fine weather still con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, the hunters determined to have another</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for the musk-ox. It was only fair to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give Altamont a chance with the distinct understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that he should have the right of firing, however</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinating the game they might meet.

This New America was evidently either a</seg><seg type="columnLine">continent or an island of considerable extent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duk was running far ahead of his party when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped suddenly short, and began sniffing the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he had caught scent of game. Next minute he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed forward again with extreme rapidity, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily out of sight. But loud distinct barking con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced the hunters that the faithful fellow had at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered the desired object.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They hurried onwards and after an hour and a half's</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick walking, found him standing in front of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">formidable-looking animals, and barking furiously. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor recognized them at once as belonging to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">musk-ox, or Ovibos genus, as naturalists call it, by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very wide horns touching each other at their base, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the absence of muzzle, by the narrow, square fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, resembling that of a sheep, and by the very short</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail. Their hair was long and thickly-matted, and mixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fine brown, silky wool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These singular-looking quadrupeds were not the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of Duk, though extremely surprised; but at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first glimpse of the hunters they took flight, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no easy task to go after them, for half an hour's swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">running brought them no nearer, and left the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">party so out of breath, that they were forced to come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a halt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound the beasts!" said Altamont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Altamont, I'll make them over to you," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clawbonny; "they are true Americans, and they don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear to have a very favorable idea of their fellow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countrymen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That proves our hunting prowess," rejoined Alta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime the oxen finding themselves no longer pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sued, had stopped short. Further pursuit was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently useless. If they were to be captured at all they</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be surrounded, and the plateau which they first</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to have reached, was very favorable for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose. Leaving Duk to worry them, they went down</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the neighboring ravines, and got to one end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau, where Altamont and the Doctor hid themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind projecting rocks, while Hatteras went on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other end, intending to startle the animals by his sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den appearance, and drive them back towards his corn*</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose you have no objection this time to be'</seg><seg type="columnLine">stow a few bullets on these gentry?" said Altamont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no, it is *a fair field now, and no favor,' 'â¢</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned Clawbonny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The oxen had begun to shake themselves impatiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Duk, trying to kick him off, when Hatteras started</seg><seg type="columnLine">up right in front of them, shouting and chasing them</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. This was the signal for Altamont and the Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rush forward and fire, but at the sight of two assail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants, the terrified animals wheeled round and attacked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatteras. He met their onset with a firm, steady foot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fired straight at their heads. But both his balls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were powerless, and only served still further to madden</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enraged beasts. They rushed upon the unfortu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nate man like furies, and threw him on the ground in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is a dead man!" exclaimed the Doctor, in despair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing accents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tremendous struggle was going on in Altamont's</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast at the sight of his prostrate foe, and though his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first impulse was to hasten to his help, he stopped short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">battling with himself and his prejudices. But his hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation scarcely lasted half a second. His better self</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquered, and he rushed forward with Clawbonny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatteras full well understood how his rival felt, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rather have died than have begged his interven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. However, he had hardly time to think about it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Altamont was at his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could not have held out much longer, for it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to ward off the blows of horns and hoofs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two such powerful antagonists, and in a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">more he must have been torn to pieces. But suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">two shots resounded, and Hatteras felt the balls graze</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Courage!" shouted Altamont, flinging away his</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharged weapon, and throwing himself right in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the raging animals. One of them, shot to the heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell dead as he reached the spot, while the other dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly on Hatteras, and was about to gore the unfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunate captain with his horns, when Altamont plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">his snow knife far into the beast's wide open jaws with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand, and with the other dealt him such a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous blow on the head with his hatchet, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull was completely split open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was done so quickly that it seemed like a flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning, and all was over. The second ox lay dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Clawbonny shouted, "Hurrah! hurrah!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatteras was saved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He owed his life to the man he hated the most. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">a storm of conflicting passions this must have roused in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his soul! But where was the emotion he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">master?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, his action was prompt, whatever his feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be. Without a moment's hesitancy, he went up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his rival, and said in a grave voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Altamont, you have saved my life!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You saved mine," replied the American.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a moment's silence, and then Altamont</seg><seg type="columnLine">added:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're quits, Hatteras."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Altamont," said the captain; "when the Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged you out of your icy tomb, I did not know who</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were; but you saved me at the peril of your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, knowing quite well who I was."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, you are a fellow-creature at any rate, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever faults an American may have, he is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">coward," Altamont said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, indeed," said the Doctor. "He is a man, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch as much as yourself, Hatteras."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And, like me, he shall have part in the glory that</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaits us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The glory of reaching the North Pole?" said Alta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">350</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mont. "I can share your glory in this discovery?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," replied Hatteras, proudly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I guessed right then," said Altamont. "And you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have actually dared to conceive such a project. Oh! it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is grand; I tell you it is sublime even to think of it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But tell me" said Hatteras in a hurried manner;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you were not bound for the Pole then yourself?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Altamont hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, speak out, man," urged the Doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, to tell the truth, I was not, and the truth is</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than self-love. No, I had no such grand pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose in view. I was trying to find the Northwest Pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage, and that was all. I would never have dreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such a stupendous undertaking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Altamont," said Hatteras, holding out his hand; "be</seg><seg type="columnLine">our companion to glory; come with us and find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">North Pole."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men clasped hands in a warm, hearty grasp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a strong bond of friendship between them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they turned to look for the Doctor they found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in tears. "Ah! friends," he said, wiping his eyes;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you have made me so happy, it is almost more than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can bear! You have sacrificed this miserable nationality</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the sake of the common cause. You have said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'What does it matter, if only the Pole is discovered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether it is by an Englishman or an American ?' Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should we brag of being American or English, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can boast that we are men? It is an infinitely more</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthwhile boast." .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The good little man was beside himself with joy. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hugged the reconciled enemies to his bosom, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cemented their newly found friendship by his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">affection to both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last he grew calm, after at least a twentieth em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brace, and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is time I went to work now. Since I am no hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, I must use my talents in another direction."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he began to cut up the oxen so skillfully, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seemed like a surgeon making a delicate autopsy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His two companions looked on, smiling. In a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes the adroit operator had cut off more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred pounds of flesh. This he divided into three</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts. Each man took one, and they retraced their</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps to Fort Providence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At ten o'clock they arrived at Doctor's House, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson and Bell had a good supper prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before sitting down to enjoy it, the Doctor ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed in a jubilant tone, and pointing to his two com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions, said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear old Johnson, I took out an American and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Englishman with me, didn't I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Dr. Clawbonny."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I bring back two brothers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was joyous news to the sailors, and they shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands warmly with Altamont; while the Doctor re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted all that had passed, and how the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain had saved the English captain's life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night no five happier men could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found anywhere than those five who lay sleeping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little snow-house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          CHAPTER XVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          Final Preparations</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEXT day the weather changed and the cold re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. Snow, rain, and tempest came in quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">succession for several days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell had completed the sloop, and done his work well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the little vessel was admirably adapted for the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose contemplated, being high at the sides and partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">decked, so as to be able to stand a heavy sea, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">light enough to be drawn on the sledge without over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burdening the dogs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last a change of the greatest importance took place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ice began to tremble in the center of the bay, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the highest masses became loosened at their base ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to form icebergs, and drift away before the first gale;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Hatteras would not wait for the ice-fields to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">up before he started. Since the journey must be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">on land, he did not care whether the sea was open</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not; and the day of departure was fixed for the 25th</seg><seg type="columnLine">of June--Johnson and Bell undertaking the necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">repairs of the sled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the 20th, finding there was space enough between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broken ice to allow the sloop to get through, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to take her on a trial trip to Cape Washing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. The sea was not quite open, but it w'ould have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been impossible to go across on foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This short sail of six hours sufficiently tested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers of the sloop, and proved her excellent qualities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In coming back they witnessed a curious sight; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chase of a seal by a gigantic bear. Mr. Bruin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too busily engaged to notice the vessel, or he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have pursued them; he was intently watching beside a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seal-hole with the patience of a true hunter, or rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">angler, for he was certainly fishing just then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But all of a sudden there was a slight disturbance</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the surface of the water in the hole, which announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coming up of the amphibious animal. Instantly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear lay flat on his belly, his two paws stretched round</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next minute up came the seal, but his head no sooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared above the water than the bear's paws closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him like a vise, and dragged him right out. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor seal struggled desperately, but could not free him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self from the iron grasp of his enemy, who hugged him</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer and closer, till suffocation was complete. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he carried him off to his den as if the weight were noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, leaping lightly from pack to pack till he gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">terra firma safely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the 22nd of June, Hatteras began to load the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sled. They put in 200 lbs. of salt meat, three cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vegetables and preserved meat, besides lime-juice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flour, and medicine. They also took 200 lbs. of</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder and a stock of fire-arms. Including the sloop</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Halkett-boat, there was about 1,500 lbs. weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavy load for four dogs, and all the more as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to drag it every day, instead of only four</seg><seg type="columnLine">days successively, like the dogs employed by the Esqui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maux, who always keep a relay for their sleds. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, the distance to the Pole was not 350 miles at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, and they did not intend to go more than twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles a day, as they could do it comfortably in a month.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DESERT OF ICE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">351</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Even if land failed them, they could always fall back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sloop, and finish the journey without fatigue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to men or dogs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the party were in excellent health, though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lost flesh a little; but, by attending to the Doctor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise counsel, they had weathered the winter without</seg><seg type="columnLine">being attacked by any of the maladies incident to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">climate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, they were almost at their journey's end, and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one doubted of success, for a common bond of sympathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound fast the five men, and made them strong to</seg><seg type="columnLine">persevere. On Sunday, the 23rd, all was ready, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was resolved to devote the entire day to rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dwellers on Fort Providence could not see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last day dawn without some emotion. It cost them a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pang to leave the snow-hut which had served them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such good stead, and this hospitable shore where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed the winter. Take it altogether, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent very happy hours there, and the Doctor made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching reference to the subject as they sat round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table at the evening meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They retired early to rest, for they needed to be up</seg><seg type="columnLine">betimes. So passed the last night at Fort Providence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIX</seg><seg type="columnLine">March to the North</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEXT day at early dawn, Hatteras gave the signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">for departure. The well-fed and well-rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs were harnessed to the sled. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been having a good time of it all the winter, and might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be expected to do good service during the summer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at six in the morning when the expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">started. After following the windings of the bay and</seg><seg type="columnLine">going past Cape Washington, they struck into the direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">route for the north, and by seven o'clock had lost sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lighthouse and Fort Providence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the first two days they made twenty miles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve hours, devoting the remainder of the time to rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and meals. The tent was quite sufficient protection</seg><seg type="columnLine">during sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The temperature began to rise. In many places the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow melted entirely away, and great patches of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared; here and there complete ponds, which a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch of imagination might easily convert into lakes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The travelers were often up to their knees, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">only laughed over it: and, indeed, the Doctor was rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad of such unexpected baths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But for all that." he said, "the water has no business</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wet us here. It is an element which has no right</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this country, except in a solid or vaporous state. Ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">or vapor is all very well, but water--never!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hunting was not forgotten during the march, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh meat was a necessity. Altamont and Bell kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">their guns loaded, and shot ptarmigans, guillemots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">geese, and a few young hares; but, by degrees, birds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals had been changing from trustfulness to fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had become so shy and difficult to approach, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">very often, but for Duk, the hunters would have wasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">their powder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatteras advised them not to go more than a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, as there was not a day, nor even an hour, to lose,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for three months of fine weather was the utmost they;</seg><seg type="columnLine">could count upon. Besides, the sled was often com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to difficult places, when each man was needed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lend a helping hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the third day they came to a lake, several acres</seg><seg type="columnLine">in extent, and still entirely frozen over. The sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays had little access to it, owing to its situation, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ice was so strong that it must have dated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">some remote winter. It was strong enough to bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">both the travelers and their sled, and w'as covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From this point the country became gradually lower,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which the Doctor concluded that this New Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ica did not extend to the Pole, but was most probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">an island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up to this time the expedition had been attended</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no fatigue. The travelers had only suffered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intense glare of the sun on the snow, which threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened them with snow-blindness. At another time of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the year they might have avoided this by walking dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the night, but at present there was no night at all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Happily the snow was beginning to melt, and the bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liancy would diminish as the process of dissolution ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the 8th of June the thermometer rose to 45Â° and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rain fell in torrents. Hatteras and his companions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, marched stoically on, and even hailed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">downpour with delight, knowing that it would hasten</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disappearance of the snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they went along the Doctor often picked up stones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both round ones and flat pebbles, as if worn away by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tide. He thought from this they must be near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polar Basin, and yet far as the eye could reach was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">interminable plain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was not a trace of houses, or huts, or cairns</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible. It was evident that the Greenlanders had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed their way so far north, and yet the famished</seg><seg type="columnLine">trihes would have found their account in coming, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country abounded in game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the 29th Bell killed a fox, and Altamont a musk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ox. These supplies of fresh food were very acceptable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even the Doctor surveyed, with considerable satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction, the haunches of meat they managed to procure</seg><seg type="columnLine">from time to time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Don't let us stint ourselves," he used to say on these</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasions; "food is no unimportant matter in expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions like ours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Especially," said Johnson, "when a meal depends</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a lucky shot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're right, Johnson; a man does not think so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much about dinner when he knows the soup-pot is</seg><seg type="columnLine">simmering by the kitchen-fire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the 30th, they came to a district which seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been upturned by some volcanic convulsion, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered was it with cones and sharp lofty peaks. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong breeze from the southeast was blowing, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon increased to a hurricane, sweeping over the rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with snow and the huge masses of ice, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the forms of icebergs and hummocks, though on</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tempest was followed by damp, warm weather,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">which caused a regular thaw. On all sides nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">352</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could be heard but the noise of cracking ice and falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">avalanches. The travelers had to be very careful in</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoiding hills, and even in speaking aloud, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest agitation in the air might have caused a</seg><seg type="columnLine">catastrophe. Indeed, the suddenness is the peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">feature in Arctic avalanches, distinguishing them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of Switzerland and Norway. Often the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodgment of a block of ice is instantaneous, and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a cannon-ball or thunderbolt could be more rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its descent. The loosening, the fall, and the crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen almost simultaneously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Happily, however, no accident befell any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party, and three days afterwards they came to smooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">level ground again. But here a new phenomenon met</seg><seg type="columnLine">their gaze--a phenomenon which was long a subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">of patient inquiry among the learned of both hemi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres. They came to a long chain of low hills which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to extend for miles, and were all covered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eastern side with bright red snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is easy to imagine the surprise and half-terrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation of the little company at the sight of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">long red curtain; but the Doctor hastened to reassure</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, or rather to instruct them, as to the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this peculiar snow. He told them that this same red</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance had been found in Switzerland, in the heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Alps, and that the color proceeded solely from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of certain corpuscles, about the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which for a long time chemists could not agree. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not decide whether these corpuscles were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal or vegetable origin, but at last it was settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they belonged to the family of fungi, being a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of microscopic mushroom of the species Urcdo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piercing the snow over with his iron-tipped staff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Doctor found that the coloring matter extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a depth of nine feet. He pointed this out to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions, that they might have some idea of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous number of these tiny mushrooms in a layer</seg><seg type="columnLine">extending so many miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This phenomenon was none the less strange for</seg><seg type="columnLine">being explained, for red is a color seldom seen in na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture over any considerable area. The reflection of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's rays upon it produced the most peculiar effect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighting up men and animals, and rocks with a fiery</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow, as if proceeding from some flame within. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow melted it looked like blood, as the red particles</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not decompose.

No mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure, however, befell the party during the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, except the loss of Bell's snow-shoes.

"Listen!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you hear that crash? That is certainly the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of icebergs falling.

About day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">break its fury seemed to have spent itself, and Hat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teras, accompanied by Bell and Altamont, ventured to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the tent. They climbed a hill about three hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet high, which commanded a wide view. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a metamorphosed region met their gaze! All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice had completely vanished, the storm had chased</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the winter, and stripped the soil everywhere of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its snow covering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Hatteras scarcely bestowed a glance on surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing objects; his eager gaze was bent on the northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon, which appeared shrouded in black mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That may very likely be caused by the ocean," sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested Clawbonny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right.

Three hours afterwards they arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the coast, and shouted simultaneously, "The sea!</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ay, and open sea!" added Hatteras.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so it was. The storm had opened wide the Polar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basin, and loosened packs were drifting in all direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The icebergs had weighed anchor, and were sailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the open sea. This new ocean stretched out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight, and not a single island or continent was visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the east and west the coast formed two capes or</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlands, which sloped gently down to the sea. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center, a projecting rock formed a small natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay, sheltered on three sides, into which a wide river</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, bearing in its bosom the melted snows of winter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a careful survey of the coast, Hatteras de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to launch the sloop that very day, and to un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack the sled and get everything on board. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent was soon put up, and a comfortable repast pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared. This important business despatched, work com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced ; and all hands were so expeditious and will-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, that by five o'clock nothing more remained to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. The sloop lay rocking gracefully in the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay, and all the cargo was on board the boat except</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tent, and what was required for the night's en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">campment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sight of the sloop suggested to Clawbonny the</seg><seg type="columnLine">propriety of giving Altamont's name to the little bay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His proposition to that effect met with unanimous ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proval, and the port was forthwith dignified by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">title of Altamont Harbor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> According to the Doctor's calculations, the travelers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now only 3Â° distant from the Pole. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone over two hundred miles from Victoria Bay to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Altamont Harbor, and were in latitude 87Â° 5' and 118Â°</seg><seg type="columnLine">35'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          CHAPTER XXI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          The Open Sea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEXT morning by eight o'clock all the remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects were on board, and the preparations for</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure completed. But before starting, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor thought he would like to take a last look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country and see if any further traces of the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strangers could be discovered, for the mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">footmarks they had met with were never out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. He climbed to the top of a height which</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded a view of the whole southern horizon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took out his pocket-telescope. But what was his as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonishment to find he could see nothing through it, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even neighboring objects. He rubbed his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked again, but with no better result. Then he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to examine the telescope. The object-glass was gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The object-glass! This explained the whole mystery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">footprints and all; and with a shout of surprise he hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried down the hill to impart his discovery to. the won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering companions, who came running towards him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled by his loud exclamation, and full of anxiety</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his precipitate descent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what is the matter now?" said Johnson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor could hardly speak, he was so out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. At last he managed to gasp out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The tracks, footmarks, strangers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" said Hatteras, "strangers here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no, the object-glass; the object-glass out of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he held out his spy-glass for them to look at.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!

"We had lost ourselves in the fog, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been wandering in a circle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the boot marks," objected Hatteras.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bell's. He walked about a whole day after he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost his snow shoes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I did," said Bell. The mistake was so evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they all laughed heartily, except Hatteras, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one was more glad than he at the discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A quarter of an hour afterwards the little sloop</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed out of Altamont Harbor, and commenced her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voyage of discovery. The wind was favorable, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was little of it, and the weather was positively</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sloop was none the worse for the sled journey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was in first-rate trim, and easily managed. John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son steered, the Doctor, Bell, and the American leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back against the cargo, and Hatteras stood at the prow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fixed, eager gaze bent steadily on that mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">point towards which he felt drawn with irresistible</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, like the magnetic needle, to the Pole. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to be the first to descry any shore that might</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in sight, and he had every right to the honor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The water of this Polar Sea presented some peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">features worth mentioning. In color it was a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-marine blue, and possessed such a wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparency that one seemed to gaze down into fath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">omless depths. These depths were lighted up, no doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some electrical phenomenon, and so many varieties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of living creatures were visible that the vessel seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sailing over a vast aquarium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Innumerable flocks of birds were flying over the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of this marvelous ocean, darkening the sky like</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick heavy storm-clouds. Water-fowl of every de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scription were among them, from the albatross to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">penguin, and all of gigantic proportions. Their cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">were absolutely deafening, and some of them had such</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense, wide-spreading wings, that they covered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloop completely as they flew over. The Doctor thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself a good naturalist, but he found his science</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly at fault, for many a species here w'as wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown to any ornithological society.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The good little man was equally nonplussed when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked at the water, for he saw the most wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">medusae, some so large that they looked like little islands</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating about among Brobdingnagian sea-weeds. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the surface, what a spectacle met the eye! My-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riads of fish of every species; young seals at play with</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other; narwhals with their one strong weapon of</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense, like the horn of a unicorn, chasing the timid</seg><seg type="columnLine">seals; whales of every tribe, spouting out columns of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, and filling the air with a peculiar whizzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise; dolphins, seals, and walruses, quietly browsing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on submarine pastures; and the Doctor could gaze at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all as easily and clearly as if they were in glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks in the Zoological Gardens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a strange supernatural purity about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere. It seemed charged to overflowing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen, and had a marvelous power of exhilaration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">producing an almost intoxicating effect on the brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Towards evening Hatteras and his companions lost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the coast. Night came on, though the sun re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained just above the horizon; it had the same in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence on animated nature as in temperate zones. Birds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish, and all the cetacea disappeared, and perfect silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevailed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since the departure from Altamont Harbor, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloop had made one degree farther north. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">day brought no signs of land; there was not even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">speck on the horizon. The wind was still favorable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sea pretty calm. The birds and fishes re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned as numerously as on the preceding day, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor, leaning over the side of the vessel, could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whales and the dolphins, and all the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsters of the deep, gradually coming up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear depths below. On the surface, far as the eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">could reach, nothing was visible except a solitary ice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berg here and there, and a few scattered floes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indeed, but little ice was met with anywhere. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloop was ten degrees above the point of greatest cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and consequently in the same temperature as Baffin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bay and Disko. It was therefore not astonishing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea should be open in these summer months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is a fact of great practical value, for if ever the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whalers can penetrate north as far as the Polar Basin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they may be sure of an immediate cargo, as this part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean seems to be the general reservoir of whales '</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seals, and every marine species.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day wore on, but still nothing appeared on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon. Hatteras never left the prow of the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but stood, glass in hand, eagerly gazing into the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance with anxious, questioning eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Getting Near the Pole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOUR after hour passed away, and still Hatteras</seg><seg type="columnLine">persevered in his weary watch, though his hopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared doomed to disappointment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length, about six in the evening, a dim, hazy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapeless sort of mist seemed to rise far away between</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea and sky.

Why, then, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not volcanoes be found near the North Pole?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is possible, certainly," replied Altamont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, now I see it distinctly," exclaimed the Doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is a volcano!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us make right for it then," said Hatteras.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was impossible longer to doubt the proximity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coast. In twenty-four hours, probably, the bold</seg><seg type="columnLine">navigators might hope to set foot on its untrodden</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil. But strange as it was, now that they were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the goal of their voyage, no one showed the joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">which might have been expected. Each man sat silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed in his own thoughts, wondering what sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">place this Pole must be. The birds seemed to shun it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for though it was evening, they were all flying towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south with outspread wings. Was it, then, so in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospitable, that not so much as a sea-gull or a ptarmigan</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find a shelter? The fish, too, even the large</seg><seg type="columnLine">cetacea, were hastening away through the transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters. What could cause this feeling either of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsion or terror?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last sleep overcame the tired men, and one after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another dropped off, leaving Hatteras to keep watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took the helm, and tried his best not to close his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, for he grudged losing precious time; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow motion of the vessel rocked him into a state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such irresistible somnolence that, in spite of himself, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soon, like his companions, locked fast in deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumber. He began to dream, and imagination brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">back all the scenes of his past life. He dreamed of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, the Forward, and of the traitors that had burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Again he felt all the agonies of disappointment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure, and forgot his actual situation. Then the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed, and he saw himself at the Pole unfurling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Union Jack!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While memory and fancy were thus busied, an enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous cloud of an olive tinge had begun to darken sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sky. A hurricane was at hand. The first blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tempest roused the captain and his companions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were on their feet in an instant, ready to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The sea had risen tremendously, and the ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossing violently up and down on the billows. Hatteras</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the helm again, and kept a Arm hold of it, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson and Bell baled out the water which was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly dashing over the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a difficult matter to preserve the right course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the thick fog made it impossible to see more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few yards off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This sudden tempest might well seem to such excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, a stern prohibition against further approach to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pole; but it needed but a glance at their resolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces to know that they would yield neither to winds</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor waves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a whole day the struggle lasted, death threatening</seg><seg type="columnLine">them each moment; but about six in the evening, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the fury of the waves seemed at its highest pitch,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there came a sudden calm. The wind was stilled as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">miraculously, and the sea became smooth as glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came a most extraordinary inexplicable phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fog, without dispersing, became strangely lum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inous, and the sloop sailed along in a zone of electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Mast, sail, and rigging appeared penciled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">black against the phosphorescent sky with wondrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctness. The men were bathed in light, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces shone with a fiery glow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The volcano!" exclaimed Hatteras.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it possible?" said Bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no!" replied Clawbonny. "We should be suffo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated with its flames so near."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps it is the reflection," suggested Altamont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not that much even, for then we must be near</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, and in that case we should hear the noise of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eruption."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, then?" asked the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a cosmical phenomenon," replied the Doctor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"seldom met hitherto. If we go on, we shall soon get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of our luminous sphere and be back in the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tempest again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, let's go on, come what may," said Hatteras.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor was right. Gradually the fog began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose its light and then its transparency, and the howling</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind was heard not far off. A few minutes more, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little vessel was caught in a violent squall, and swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the cyclone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the hurricane had fortunately turned a point</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the south, and left the vessel free to run before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind straight towards the Pole. There was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minent danger of her sinking, for she sped along at</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzied speed, and any sudden collision with rock or</seg><seg type="columnLine">iceberg must have inevitably dashed her to pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But not a man on board counseled prudence. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were intoxicated with the danger, and no speed could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be quick enough to satisfy their longing impatience to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last they began evidently to near the coast. Strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">symptoms were manifest in the air; the fog suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent like a curtain torn by the wind; and for an instant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a flash of lightning, an immense column of flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seen on the horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The volcano! the volcano!" was the simultaneous</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the words had hardly passed their lips before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fantastic vision had vanished. The wind suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed to the southeast, and drove the boat back</seg><seg type="columnLine">again from the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound it!" said Hatteras; "we weren't three</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from the coast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "However, resistance was impossible. All that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be done was to keep tacking; but every few minutes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little sloop would be thrown on her side though she</seg><seg type="columnLine">righted herself again immediately, obedient to the helm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Hatteras stood with disheveled hair, grasping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helm as if welded to his hand, he seemed the animating</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul of the vessel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All at once a fearful sight met his gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scarcely twenty yards in front was a great block</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ice coming right towards them mounting and falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">356</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the stormy billows, ready to overturn at any moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crush them in its descent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this was not the only danger that threatened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bold navigators. The iceberg was packed with white</seg><seg type="columnLine">bears, huddling close together, and evidently beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves with terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The iceberg made frightful lurches, sometimes inclin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at such a sharp angle that the animals rolled pell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mell over each other and set up a loud growling, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingled with the roar of the elements and made a ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible concert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a quarter of an hour, which seemed a whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">century, the sloop sailed on in this formidable com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany, sometimes a few yards distant and sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">near enough to touch. The Greenland dogs trembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fear, but Duk was quite imperturbable. At last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">iceberg lost ground, and got driven by the wind farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">and farther away till it disappeared in the fog, only at</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals betraying its presence by the ominous growls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its crew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The storm now burst forth with redoubled fury.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little bark was lifted bodily out of the water, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled round and round with the most frightful rapid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. Mast and sail were blown away, and went flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the darkness, like some huge white bird. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirlpool began to form among the waves, drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the ship gradually by its irresistible suction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deeper and deeper she sank, whizzing round at such</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous speed that, to the poor fellows on board,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water seemed motionless. All five men stood erect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing at each other in speechless terror. But suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat rose perpendicularly, her bow went above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the vortex, and getting out of the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">attraction by her own velocity, she escaped at a tangent</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the circumference, and was thrown far beyond,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a ball from a cannon's mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Altamont, the Doctor, Johnson, and Bell were pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat on the planks. When they got up, Hatteras had</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was two o'clock in the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          CHAPTER XXIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          The English Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OR a few seconds they seemed stupefied, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cry of "Hatteras!" broke from every lip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On all sides, nothing was visible but the tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pestuous ocean. Duk barked desperately, and Bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hardly keep him from leaping into the waves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take the helm, Altamont," said the Doctor, "and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us try our utmost to find our poor captain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnson and Bell seized the oars, and rowed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more than an hour; but their search was vain--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatteras was lost!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lost!--and so near the Pole, just as he had caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the goal!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor called, and shouted, and fired signals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Duk made piteous lamentations; but there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">response. Clawbonny could bear up no longer; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried his head in his hands, and fairly wept aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">At such a distance from the coast it was impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Hatteras to reach it alive, without an oar or even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">so much as a spar to help him; if ever he touched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven of his desire, it would be as a swollen, mutilated</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Longer search was useless, and nothing remained but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to resume the route north. The tempest was dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and about five in the morning on the 11th of July,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind fell, and the sea gradually became calm. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky recovered its polar clearness, and less than three</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles away the land appeared in all its grandeur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next continent was only an island, or rather a</seg><seg type="columnLine">volcano, fixed like a lighthouse on the North Pole of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mountain was in full activity, pouring out a mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of white hot stones and glowing rock. At every fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">eruption there was a convulsive heaving within, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">some mighty giant were respiring, and the masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">ejected were thrown up high into the air amidst jets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bright flames, streams of lava rolling down the sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">in impetuous torrents. In one part, serpents of fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed writhing and wriggling amongst smoking rocks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in another the glowing liquid fell in cascades, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of purple vapor, into a river of fire below, formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a thousand igneous streams, which emptied itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sea, the waters hissing and seething like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiling cauldron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently there was only one crater to the vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cano, out of which the columns of fire issued, streaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with forked lightning. Electricity seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to do with this magnificent panorama.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the panting flames waved an immense plume-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped cloud of smoke, red at its base and black at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">summit. It rose with incomparable majesty, and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled in thick volumes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sky was ash-color to a great height, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident that the darkness that had prevailed while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempest lasted, which had seemed quite inexplicable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Doctor, was owing to the columns of cinders over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading the sun like a thick curtain. He remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a similar phenomenon which occurred in the Barbadoes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the whole island was plunged in profound ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurity by the mass of cinders ejected from the crater</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Isle St. Vincent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This enormous volcanic rock in the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea was six thousand feet high, just about the altitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Hecla.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to rise gradually out of the water as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat got nearer. There was no trace of vegetation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed there was no shore; the rock ran straight down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can we land?" said the Doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The wind is carrying us right to it," said Altamont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I don't see an inch of land to set our foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems so at this distance," said Johnson; "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we shall be sure to find some place to run in our boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">at, and that is all we want."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us go, then," said Clawbonny, dejectedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had no heart now for anything. The North Pole</seg><seg type="columnLine">was indeed before his eyes, but not the man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they got nearer the island, which was not more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than eight or ten miles in circumference, the naviga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DESERT OF ICE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">357</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tors noticed a tiny fiord, just large enough to harbor</seg><seg type="columnLine">their boat, and made towards it immediately. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared their captain's dead body would meet their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the coast, and yet it seemed difficult for a corpse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie on it, for there was no shore, and the sea broke on</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep rocks, which were covered with cinders above</seg><seg type="columnLine">watermark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the little boat glided gently into the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening between two sandbanks just visible above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, where she would be safe from the violence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breakers; but before she could be moored, Duk be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan howling and barking again in the most piteous</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner, as if calling on the cruel sea and stony rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to yield up his lost master. The Doctor tried to calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by caresses, but in vain. The faithful beast, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he would represent the captain, sprang on shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a tremendous bound, sending a cloud of cinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">afer him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Duk! Duk!" called Clawbonny,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Duk had already disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the sloop was made fast, they all got out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went after him. Altamont was just going to climb to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of a pile of stones, when the Doctor exclaimed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen! Listen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duk was barking vehemently some distance off, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bark seemed full of grief rather than fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Has he come on the track of some animal, do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think?" asked Johnson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no!" said Clawbonny, shuddering. "His bark</seg><seg type="columnLine">is too sorrowful; it is the dog's tear. He has founcfrthe</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of Hatteras."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They all four rushed forward, in spite of the blind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cinder-dust, and came to the far end of a fiord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they discovered the dog barking round a corpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped in the British flag!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hatteras! Hatteras!" cried the Doctor, throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself on the body of his friend. But next minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">he started up with an indescribable cry, and shouted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Alive! alive!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes!" said a feeble voice, "yes, alive at the North</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pole, on Queen's Island"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurrah for England!" shouted all with one accord.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And for America!" added Clawbonny, holding out</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand to Hatteras and the other to Altamont.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duk was not behind with his hurrah, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth quite as much as the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a few minutes the joy at the recovery of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain filled all their hearts, and the poor fellows could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not restrain their tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor found on examination, that he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously hurt.

Strictly speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the mountain was only a heap of stones thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from a height, and the mass of rocks which com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed the island had evidently come out of the bowels</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The earth, indeed, may be compared to a vast cauldron</seg><seg type="columnLine">of spherical form, in which, under the influence of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">central fire, immense quantities of vapors are generated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would explode the globe but for the safety-valves</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These safety-valves are volcanoes; when one closes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">another opens; and at the Poles, where the crust of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth is thinner, owing to its being flattened, it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">surpising that a volcano should be suddenly formed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upheaving of some part of the ocean-bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor, while following Hatteras, was closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">following all the peculiarities of the island, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">further confirmed in his opinion as to its recent forma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion by the absence of water.

Clouds of scorioe and ashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">would whirl round them repeatedly, threatening them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with asphyxia, or torrents of lava would bar their pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage.

During their ascent, symptoms of insanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become more and more marked, and no one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be surprised who knew anything of his previous his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hatteras," said the Doctor, "it is enough; we can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not go farther!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop, then," he replied, in a strangely altered voice;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am going higher."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, it is useless; you are at the Pole already."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no! higher, higher!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My friend, do you know who is speaking to you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is I, Dr. Clawbonny."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Higher, higher!" repeated the madman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well, we shall not allow it--that is all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had hardly uttered the words before Hatteras, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a superhuman effort, sprang over the boiling lava, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beyond the reach of his companions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cry of horror burst from every lip, for they thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poor captain must have perished in that fiery gulf;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there he was safe on the other side, accompanied</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his faithful Duk, who would not leave him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He speedily disappeared behind a curtain of smoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they heard his voice growing fainter in the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, shouting:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the north! to the north! to the top of Mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatteras! Remember Mount Hatteras!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All pursuit of him was out of the question; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to leap across the fiery torrent, and equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to get round it. Altamont, indeed, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad enough to make an attempt, and would certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lost his life if the others had not held him back</seg><seg type="columnLine">by main force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hatteras! Hatteras!" shouted the Doctor, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">response was heard save the faint bark of Duk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At intervals, however, a glimpse of him could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught through the clouds of smoke and showers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashes. Sometimes his head, sometimes his arm ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared; then he was out of sight again, and a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later was seen higher up clinging to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks. His size constantly decreased with the fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastic rapidity of objects rising upwards in the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In half an hour he was only half his size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air was full of the deep rumbling noise of the vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cano, and the mountain shook and trembled. From time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to time a loud fall was heard behind, and the travelers</seg><seg type="columnLine">would see some enormous rock rebounding from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heights to engulf itself in the polar basin below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatteras did not even turn once to look back, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched straight on, carrying his country's flag attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his staff. His terrified friends watched every move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and saw him gradually decrease to micro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scopic dimensions, while Duk looked no larger than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came a moment of intense anxiety, for the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat down on them an immense sheet of flame, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could see nothing but the red glare. A cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony escaped the Doctor; but an instant afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hatteras reappeared, waving his flag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a whole hour this fearful spectacle went on--an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of battle with unsteady loose rocks and quag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mires of ashes, where the foolhardy climber sank up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his knees. Sometimes they saw him hoist him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self up by leaning knees and loins against the rocks in</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow, intricate winding paths, and sometimes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be hanging on by both hands to some sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">crag, swinging to and fro like a withered tuft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last he reached the summit of the mountain, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of the crater. Here the Doctor hoped the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatuated man would stop, perhaps, recover his senses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and expose himself to no more danger than the descent</seg><seg type="columnLine">involved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more he shouted: "Hatteras! Hatteras!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was such a pathos of entreaty in his tone</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Altamont felt moved to his inmost soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll save him yet!" he exclaimed; and before Claw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonny could hinder him, he had cleared with a bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">the torrent of fire, and was out of sight among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime, Hatteras had mounted a rock which over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung the crater, and stood waving his flag amidst show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers of stones which rained down on him. Duk was</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his side; but the poor beast was growing dizzy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such close proximity to the abyss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatteras balanced his staff with one hand, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other sought to find the precise mathematical point</seg><seg type="columnLine">where all the meridians of the globe meet, the point on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it was his sublime purpose to plant his foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All at once the rock gave way, and he disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A cry of horror broke from his companions, and rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the top of the mountain. Clawbonny thought his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend had perished, and lay buried for ever in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths of the volcano. A second--only a second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it seemed an age--elapsed, and there was Alta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mont and the dog holding the ill-fated Hatteras! Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dog had caught him at the very moment when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared in the abyss;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatteras was saved ! Saved in spite of himself; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-an-hour later he lay unconscious in the arms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his despairing companions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he came to himself, the Doctor looked at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in speechless anguish, for there was no glance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognition in his eye. It was the eye of a blind man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who gazes without seeing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good heavens!" exclaimed Johnson, "he is blind!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He cannot see us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" replied Clawbonny, "no! My poor friends, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have only saved the body of Hatteras; his soul is left</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind on the top of the volcano. He is not blind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His reason is gone!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Insane!" exclaimed Johnson and Altamont, in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sternation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Insane!" replied the Doctor, and the big tears ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his cheeks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">[THE DESERT OF ICE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">361</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXV</seg><seg type="columnLine">Return South</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THREE hours after this sad denouement of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventures of Captain Hatteras, the whole party</seg><seg type="columnLine">were back once more in the grotto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clawbonny was asked his opinion as to what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">best to be done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, friends," he said, "we cannot stay longer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this island; the sea is open, and we have enough pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions. We ought to start at once, and get back with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the least delay to Fort Providence, where we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is my opinion, too," said Altamont. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind is favorable, so to-morrow we will get to sea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day passed in profound dejection. The insanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the captain was a bad omen, and when they began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk over the return voyage, their hearts failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them for fear. They missed the intrepid spirit of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, like brave men, they prepared to battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">anew with the elements and with themselves, if ever they</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt inclined to give way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next morning they made all ready to sail, and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tent and all its belongings on board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before leaving these rocks, never to return, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor carrying out the intentions of Hatteras, had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cairn erected on the very spot where the poor fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">had jumped ashore. It was made of great blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed one on the top of the other, so as to be a land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark perfectly visible while the eruption of the vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cano left it undisturbed. On one of the side stones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bell chiseled the simple inscription:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">John Hatteras</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The duplicate of the document attesting the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery of the North Pole was enclosed in a tinned iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder, and deposited in the cairn, to remain a silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness among those desert rocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This done, the four men and the captain, a poor body</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a soul, set out on the return voyage, accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied by the faithful Duk, who had become sad and</seg><seg type="columnLine">downcast. A new sail was manufactured out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent, and about ten o'clock, the little boat sailed out be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She made a quick passage, finding abundance of open</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. It was certainly easier to get away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pole than to get to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Hatteras knew nothing that was passing around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He lay full length in the boat, perfectly silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with lifeless eye and folded arms, and Duk lying at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. Clawbonny frequently addressed him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">could elicit no reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the 15th they sighted Altamont Harbor, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea was open all along the coast, they determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go round to Victoria Bay by water, instead of crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">New America in the sled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The, voyage was easy and rapid. In a week they ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished what had taken a fortnight in the sled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on the 23rd they cast anchor in Victoria Bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. As soon as the boat was made fast, they all hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Fort Providence. But what a scene of devastation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">met their eyes! Doctor's House, stores, powder-maga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zine, fortifications, all had melted away, and the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions had been ransacked by devouring animals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The navigators had almost come to the end of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplies, and had been reckoning on replenishing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">stores at Fort Providence. The impossibility of win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering there now was evident, and they decided to get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baffin Bay by the shortest route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have no alternative," said Clawbonny. "Baffin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bay is not more than six hundred miles distant. We can</seg><seg type="columnLine">sail as long as there is water enough under our boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get to Jones Sound, and then on to the Danish</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlements."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Altamont; "let us collect what food re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains, and be off at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a thorough search, a few cases of pemmican</seg><seg type="columnLine">were found scattered here and there, and two barrels</seg><seg type="columnLine">of preserved meat, altogether enough for six weeks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a good supply of powder. It was soon collected and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought on board, and the remainder of the day was</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed in caulking the boat and putting her in good</seg><seg type="columnLine">trim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next morning they put out once more to sea. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">voyage presented no great difficulties, the drift-ice be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing easily avoided; but still the Doctor thought it ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visable, in case of possible delays, to limit the rations</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one-half. This was no great hardship, as there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not much work for anyone to do, and all were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect health.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Besides, they found a little shooting, and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">down ducks, and geese, and guillemots or auks. Water</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were able to supply themselves with in abundance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the fresh-water icebergs they constantly fell in</seg><seg type="columnLine">with as they kept near the coast, not daring to venture</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the open sea in so frail a bark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that time of the year, the thermometer was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready constantly below freezing point. The frequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">rains changed to snow, and the weather became gloomy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each day the sun dipped lower below the horizon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the 30th, for a few minutes, it was out of sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, the little boat sailed steadily on. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what fatigues and obstacles a land journey in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volved, if they should be forced to adopt it, and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time was to be lost, for soon the open water would</seg><seg type="columnLine">harden to firm ground; already the young ice had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun to form. In these high latitudes there is neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring nor autumn; winter follows close on the heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">of summer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the 31st the first stars glimmered overhead, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that time forward there was continual fog,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which considerably impeded navigation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor became very uneasy at these multiplied</seg><seg type="columnLine">indications of approaching winter. He knew the diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culties Sir John Ross had to contend with after he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ship to try and reach Baffin Bay, and how, after all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was compelled to return and pass a fourth winter on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board. It was bad enough with shelter and food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel, but if any such calamity befell the survivors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Forwardif they were obliged to stop or return,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were lost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">362</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor said nothing of his anxieties to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions, but only urged them to get as far east as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, after thirty days' tolerably quick sailing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after battling for forty-eight hours against the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing drift ice, and risking the frail boat a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred times, the navigators saw themselves blocked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all sides. Further progress was impossible, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea was frozen in every direction, and the ther-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mometer was only 15Â° above zero.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Altamont made a reckoning with scrupulous pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision, and found they were in 77Â° 15' latitude, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">85Â° 2' longitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is our exact position, then," said the Doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We are in South Lincoln, just at Cape Eden, and are</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering Jones Sound. With a little more good luck, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have found open water right to Baffin Bay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we must not grumble. If my poor Hatteras had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found as navigable a sea at first, he would have soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the Pole. His men would not have deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and his brain would not have given way under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressure of terrible trial."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose, then," said Altamont, "our only course</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to leave the boat, and get by sled to the east coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Lincoln."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; but I think we should go through Jones Sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get to South Devon instead of crossing Lincoln."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because the nearer we get to Lancaster Sound, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more chance we have of meeting whalers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right; but I question whether the ice is</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm enough to make it practicable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll try," replied Clawbonny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little 'vessel was unloaded, and the sled put</seg><seg type="columnLine">together again. All the parts were in good condition, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next day the dogs were harnessed, and they started</seg><seg type="columnLine">off along the coast to reach the ice-field; but Alta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mont's opinion proved right. They could not get through</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones Sound, and were obliged to follow the coast to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, on the 24th, they set foot on North Devon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," said Clawbonny, "we have only to cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, and get to Cape Warender at the entrance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lancaster Sound."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the weather became frightful, and very cold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The snow-storms and tempests returned with winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence, and the travelers felt too weak to contend</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them. Their stock of provisions was almost ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted, and rations had to be reduced now to a third,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the dogs might have food enough to keep them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in working condition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nature of the ground added greatly to the fatigue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">North Devon is extremely wild and rugged, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path across the Trauter mountains is through difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorges. The whole party--men and dogs, and sled</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike--were frequently forced to stop, for they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not struggle on against the fury of the elements. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">than once despair crept over the brave little band, hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they were, and used to polar sufferings. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely aware of it themselves, they were completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn out, physically and mentally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not till the 30th of August that they emerged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from those wild mountains into a plain which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have been upturned and convulsed by volcanic action</seg><seg type="columnLine">at some distant period.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here it was absolutely necessary to take a few days'</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest, for the travelers could not drag one foot after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, and two of the dogs had died from exhaustion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None of the party felt equal to put up the tent, so they</seg><seg type="columnLine">took shelter behind an iceberg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Provisions were now so reduced that, notwithstanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">their scanty rations, there was only enough left for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">week. Starvation stared the poor fellows in the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Altamont, who had displayed great unselfishness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">devotion to the others, roused his sinking energies, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to go out and find food for his comrades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took his gun, called Duk, and went off almost un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed by the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been absent about an hour, and only once</seg><seg type="columnLine">during that time had they heard the report of his gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now he was coming back empty-handed, but run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning as if terrified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the matter?" asked the Doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Down there, under the snow!" said Altamont, speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as if scared, and pointing in a particular direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A whole party of men!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alive?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dead--frozen--and even--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He did not finish the sentence, but a look of unspeak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able horror came over his face. The Doctor and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others were so roused by this incident, that they man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to get up and drag themselves after Altamont</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the place he indicated. They soon arrived at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a narrow part at the bottom of a ravine, and what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacle met their gaze!

Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men themselves were never able to give any</seg><seg type="columnLine">detailed narrative of the events which occurred during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the week subsequent to the horrible discovery related in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last chapter. However, on the 9th of September, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">superhuman exertions, they arrived at last at Cape</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horsburg, the extreme point of North Devon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were absolutely starving. For forty-eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours they had tasted nothing, and their last meal had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been off the flesh of their last Esquimau dog. Bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">could go no further, and Johnson felt himself dying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were on the shore of Baffin Bay, now half-frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">over; that is to say, on the road to Europe, and three</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles off the waves were dashing noiselessly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp edges of the ice-field. Here they must wait their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of a whaler appearing, and for how long?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Heaven pitied the poor fellows, for the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">next day Altamont distinctly perceived a sail on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everyone knows the torturing suspense that follows</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an appearance, and the agonizing dread lest it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should prove a false hope. The vessel seems alternately</seg><seg type="columnLine">to approach and recede, and too often, just at the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment when the poor castaways think they are saved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sail begins to disappear, and is soon out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor and his companions went through all</seg><seg type="columnLine">these experiences. They had succeeded in reaching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western boundary of the ice-field by carrying and push-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing each other along, and they watched the ship grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually fade away from view without observing them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Just then a happy inspiration came to the Doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His fertile genius supplied him with one last idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A floe, driven by the current, struck against the ice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, and Clawbonny exclaimed, pointing to it:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us embark on this floe!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent was torn up to furnish a sail, and as soon as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frail raft was ready the poor fellows jumped upon it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sailed out to the open sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours later, after unheard-of exertions, the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivors of the Forward were picked up by the Hans</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christian, a Danish whaler, on her way to Davis Strait.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were more like specters than human beings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight of their sufferings was enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ten days afterwards, Clawbonny, Johnson, Bell, Alta-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mont, and Captain Hatteras landed at a town in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Zealand, an island belonging to Denmark. They took</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the steamer to Kiel, and from Kiel proceeded by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Altona and Hamburg to London, where they arrived</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the 13th of the same month.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The first care of Clawbonny was to request the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Royal Geographical Society to receive a communica-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion from him.

Hat-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">teras was lauded as a martyr by all the newspapers, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">every Englishman felt proud of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Doctor and his companions had the honor of be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing presented to the Queen by the Lord Chancellor, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they were feted and "lionized" in all quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Government confirmed the names of "Queen's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Island," "Mount Hatteras," and "Altamont Harbor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Altamont would not part from his companions in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">misery and glory, but followed them to Liverpool,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where they were joyously welcomed back, after being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so long supposed dead and buried beneath the snows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But Dr. Clawbonny would never allow that any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">honor was due to himself. He claimed all the merit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the discovery for his unfortunate captain, and in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the narrative of his voyage, published the next year</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he places John Hatteras on a level with the most il-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lustrious navigators, and makes him the compeer of all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the brave, daring men who have sacrificed themselves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the progress of science.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The insanity of this poor victim of a sublime passion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was of a mild type, and he lived quietly at Sten Cot-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tage, a private asylum near Liverpool, where the Doc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tor himself had placed him. He never spoke, and un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">derstood nothing that was said to him: reason and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speech had fled together. The only tie that connected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him with the outside world was his friendship for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Duk, who was allowed to remain with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For a considerable time the captain had been in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">habit of walking in the garden for hours, accompanied</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by his faithful dog, who watched him with sad, wist-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ful eyes, but his promenade was always in one direction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a particular part of the garden. When he got to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the end of this path, he would stop and begin to walk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">backwards. If anyone stopped him he would point</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with his finger towards a certain part of the sky, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">let anyone attempt to turn him round, and he became</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">angry, while Duk, as if sharing his master's sentiments,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would bark furiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Doctor, who often visited his afflicted friend,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">noticed this strange proceeding one day, and soon un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">derstood the reason of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This was the secret: John Hatteras invariably</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">faced towards the North.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">END.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DANGER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hy Irvin Lester and Fletcher Pratt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Authors of: "The Great Steel Panic," "The Roger Bacon Formula," etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              wind rose in the night and by dawn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flSgBfl yPjafl sky was streaming with torn and ragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of cloud moving from south to</seg><seg type="columnLine">north like an army in flight. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiver of cold in the air and the seas ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">so high that effective work was impossible, so we</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered in Professor Hartford's cabin to help the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man brave out his discomfort by getting him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk. The way in which he kept up his spirit, if not his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, through all the miseries of seasickness on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip, was one of the finest exhibitions of courage I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen anywhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the senior member of the Museum's staff he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a sense, in charge of the expedition, though like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of us, he was inclined to let things run themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he pursued his specialty. Perhaps it was for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunate for him that the protozoa can be studied as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well on a constantly moving steamer as on dry land;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the work kept his mind off his troubles. At all</seg><seg type="columnLine">events, every day that was calm enough for him to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of bed, found him poring over his microscope in</seg><seg type="columnLine">search of hitherto undescribed forms in this remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the Pacific.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On days such as this he lay in his bunk, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween uneasy heavings of the rnal-dc-mcr that plagued</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, lectured our crowd of assorted scientific experts</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the importance of unicellular life. Very inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting lectures they must have been to the other chaps;</seg><seg type="columnLine">even I was sometimes caught by the spell of the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor's keen and philo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sophical observation, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mere artist I always felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less a misfit among</seg><seg type="columnLine">all those -ologies and -isms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remember this day in</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular, partly because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening brought us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our first view of Easter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island and partly because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conversation turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those scientific generaliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, which are both easier</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand and more interesting to the non-scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearer. But even then, I probably would have recalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">it only as one of a number of similar talks, had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">after events given it a peculiar, almost a sinister sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burgess, our entomologist, had been trying to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor out by descanting on the rising tide of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sect life. "Sooner or later," he declared, "we will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight for our lives with them. Science always plods</seg><seg type="columnLine">along behind their attacks. They have taken the chest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nut, the boll-weevil and corn-borer are taking two more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of our economically important plants. Who knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that nature is working in its slow way to send us</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the dinosaurs?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slap, slap, went the waves against the cabin wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps, perhaps," mused Professor Hertford,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"though I incline to think that the insects will never</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive man from the planet. Evolution allows a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one opportunity--the insects had their chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rule the world in the Carboniferous, and failed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ". . . No," he went on, "there are many lines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution untried, but none of them lead through ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isting forms. When a more capable type than man</seg><seg type="columnLine">appears, it will be in a wholly new form of animal life</seg><seg type="columnLine">--perhaps even a direct evolution from the protozoa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So far as we know, evolution along that line has never</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken place to any great extent. The division between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one-celled and many-celled animals is sharper than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that between an insect and an elephant. Think of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-celled animal, practically immortal as they are and</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed of intelligence. No matter what work we do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter what records we leave, the greater portion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of human knowledge perishes with the minds that give</seg><seg type="columnLine">it birth. Think what it would mean if one person could</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on gathering knowledge through the centuries."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But," objected Burgess, "a parmoecium hasn't any</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain tissue. You can't have that without some ner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vous organization."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, my dear Burgess," said the professor, ur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">banely, "is brain tissue necessary to thought?

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole southwest was streaked with the orange presage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a fairer day and, right in the center of the illumina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, grey and ominous, a huge cone rose steeply from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's Puakatina," said Bronson the mate, pausing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside me.

Indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the statues that gave me what should have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clue--a queer idea that all was not quite as it should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be on this island--an idea that I would dismiss as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterview, were it not that I find on the margin of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my sketches, made at the time, a note to the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">that something very curious must have happened on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island.

"I could have sworn</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dredge caught something heavy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It did," I answered, pointing. There was a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratch of bright metal along one side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Corals possibly," he remarked. "Hey, Bronson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">any reefs charted here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mate strolled up. "Not on the charts," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but you never can tell. These Chilean charts aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">very good, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "M--m--m" murmured Howard, continuing his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amination. "There ought to be fragments of coralline</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation here, but there aren't. Wonder what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have been? Almost as though we'd caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">something and it got away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought of Hertford's comment about a destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive organism slipped into my mind, to be dismissed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">not worth mentioning. Rock, shark, almost anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have made that mark on the dredge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were no specimens ready to be sketched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning, apd I went ashore with the first boat to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wander about the island with my drawing materials.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It must have been nearly noon when I rounded a jut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting outcrop of rock to see before me a little sandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cove, placid and unresponsive in the heat, without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of life. Far ahead, a dark blob of rock was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only mark on the perfect line of the beach. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so suave a scene that I sat down to make a sketch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After I had pencilled it in and was mixing the brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">color for the cliffs, I noted that the rock seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have moved, but I attributed it to imagination and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on with my coloring. It must have been quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten minutes when I looked up again. This -time there</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be no doubt--neither the outline nor the posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the rock were at all as I had recorded them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN some excitement, I started to climb' down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff toward this singular rock that changed place and</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, but the distance was considerable, and while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still a quarter of a mile away, it moved again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">visibly this time, sliding down to the water's edge, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it disappeared beneath the gentle surge. The most</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar thing about it was that there seemed to be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensible method of progress; it flowed, like a huge, ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular drop of liquid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hurried back to the camp with my sketch and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">tale, but found the rest in no condition to listen.

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">all heard him scream, and hurried to the spot. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">we got there he was already dead, with a round hole in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest, and shortly after he turned that hideous</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue-black that people turn to who die of snake-bite. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been one of those sea-snakes but for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of the wound."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sure I saw something sliding away into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water," added Greaves, the botanist, "but it didn't look</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the least like a snake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shadow of the old man's death lay on our little</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin conference that night, inhibiting speech, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the means of it remained a mystery. It was not until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told my tale that there was any conversation at all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I finished there was a little moment of silence, dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing which each one made the obvious parallel between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the occurrence and the death of Makoi Toa, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Hertford asked to see my sketch. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it closely for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unless I am mistaken, gentlemen," he said, "we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing an unknown organism of serious potentialities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">May I ask that you do not go ashore to-morrow unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are well armed and in pairs?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, professor?" asked de Salza.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would prefer not to hazard a guess just yet. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be in error." And that was the last word on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject that we could draw from him, although de</seg><seg type="columnLine">Salza laughed at the idea of anything sinister in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection with this little spot of land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day was bright and clear, and after attend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the burial service for Makoi Toa, I sought Greaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and together we made for the spot where I had seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving rock. I admit we were culpable in not going</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed as the professor advised, but who would then</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought . . . .?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We reached the place about the same time I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been there the previous day, climbed down the cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">with each other's help, and walked across the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand of the cove, to where I had seen the moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. It was not more than ten yards from the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a place where the receding tide of years had left a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of little arched caves. Just where I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketched the rock was a ridge of sand pushed aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the weight of whatever had been there, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of it, a round, hard ball, perhaps three or four</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches in diameter. Greaves picked it up, turning it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over curiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, it's feathers and bones," he said, extending</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to me, "just as though it had been regurgitated by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelican or an eagle after a meal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I reached my hand for it, and just then, by the grace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Providence, caught a flicker of motion out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail of my eye. I turned to meet it; my foot gave on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft sand, and I fell prone. It was the fall that</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved me; for something sharp whistled not an inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">past my shoulder as I went down. The next instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard Greaves shout, and felt him tug my arm, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same moment something cold and clammy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard grated and gripped against my foot. A horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, the fear of imminent death, turned me to ice;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I seemed incapable of movement, but somehow got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one knee, and between my own efforts and Greaves'</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull, the grip on my foot relaxed. I half stumbled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-rolled down the sand, and as I did so, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">another whistling flash and something struck the pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my coat, going right through the cloth and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketch pad beneath it, to fall short of my skin by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowest of margins. Greaves was pulling me to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, and in a moment we were running.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the interests of science I regret that we stood not</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the order of our going. Neither of us spoke till</seg><seg type="columnLine">we turned and paused at the top of the cliff, after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathless climb. The cove was as empty as it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God What was it?" I gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know, I don't know." Greaves was half</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing with excitement. "Something big and sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">--all soft--threw those things at us--half a dozen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--My God."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE were both so much shaken that the journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the camp seemed interminable, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time after our arrival before a consecutive story</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be gotten out of Greaves. When he did tell his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tale, it appeared that he had noticed the thing almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as I--a great, dead brown object of uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">form which had slid up softly from the water and shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the darts I had seen without warning or sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"as a cuttlefish does when you touch it," said Greaves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shudder. "The horrible part about it was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing had no eyes but seemed to see perfectly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">know just where to move to head us off. I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd never get you pulled loose . . . All the time I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodging those darts I kept thinking about Makoi</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toa. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you will agree," said Professor Hertford,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had finished his rather incoherent account,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that my anticipations have been realized. Everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">points to the presence in these waters of an efficient and</seg><seg type="columnLine">destructive organism, capable not only of dominating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole animal environment, but possibly even of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">populating Easter Island. From your description,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is very rough and inaccurate, I should not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">surpised to find it a giant new species of infusorian or</seg><seg type="columnLine">jellyfish. Both types have those stinging tentacles. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am in favor of remaining until we obtain more data</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this animal, but as some--er--danger may attend</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a course, I should prefer to leave it to the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jority."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What could we do in the face of such an appeal?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Personally, I had felt the grip on my foot and had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to feel it again. I could understand the flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scientific interest driving the others, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather with foreboding than enthusiasm that I listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the eager plans they "made for entrapping one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals which had attacked us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I doubt whether anybody except de Salza (who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a human fish, intolerant of anything but the record</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rocks) was absent from the group which gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered behind the top of the cliffs the next morning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch the fluttering antics of a chicken pegged out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand where we had met our adventure. Howard</seg><seg type="columnLine">368</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and Grimm (the conchologist) were armed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only two rifles the expedition afforded, it having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed that it was better to examine a dead specimen</seg><seg type="columnLine">before trying to take a live one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun grew unconscionably hot as it swung across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky. We conversed in low tones and were wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing whether we had come on a wild goose chase when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw Howard beside me, stiffen to attention. I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around--there was a break in the ripple, and through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly emerged the shape of the monster, dull brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hue. I felt a quiver of excitement; the chicken was</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining to the limit of its rope. There was a crack!</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made all of us jump, as someone fired. "No, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet," cried the professor, but the dark form took no</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice, only moved on, formless and flowing, with half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a score of short tentacles waving before it. Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to notice the chicken, paused, waved a tentacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two at it, and there was a flicking motion as one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darts shot out. The chicken went limp and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster flowed gently over it. When it had passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chicken, rope, and even the stake, were gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both men were now firing, but they might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been throwing peas. The fantastic mound of jelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled back into the water in the same leisurely fashion</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had come out, and disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everybody began to talk at once, "The thing must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be bullet proof!" "Inverterbrate, but what aJ^inverter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brate!" "So that's what cleaned up Easter Island!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did you notice the ossicles?" "It's a hydroid!" "More</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a medusid." "What do you think. Dr. Hertford?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On one thing the conference that followed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed: that the animal, whatever it was, must be cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured and examined. Various wild suggestions about</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamite and chemicals came up to be laughed down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was Dr. Hertford, as usual, who supplied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">determining factor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems to me," said he, "that it would be worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">while to postpone our trip to the continent and attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take one of these animals in one of the mammal</seg><seg type="columnLine">cages. I believe the one you shot at was at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously injured; it seems incredible that it could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether bullet proof. We may, therefore, have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait before another appears. What do you say?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Salza's was the only dissenting voice. I kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. I wish I had not, for though my protest might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done little good, it would at least have taken a</seg><seg type="columnLine">load from my conscience that can never be quite clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. However, I made no protest. The cage was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigged up on the shore with another chicken inside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trick arrangement to slam the door shut on the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vader and we sat down at the cove to wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was the afternoon of the third day from the instal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation of the cage, and I was in my tent at the camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to capture the color pattern of a small and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiggly fish when the excited voice of Howard hailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to announce that the cage held a prisoner. At once</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything else was forgotten and we all hurried off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pell-mell, Dr. Hertford for all his years, well in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure enough the little mammal cage was filled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">overflowing with the brown jelly-like mass of the mon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ster, a tentacle or two waving in a friendly manner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the edges of the mass where it bulged between</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the bars. I admit it gave me a gone ieeling in the pit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the stomach to watch it; it was like nothing I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever seen or heard of, but among the scientists it pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">duced only the liveliest interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Warned by previous experience, they approached it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with some caution, Howard carrying a piece of sheet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">iron from the ship before the professor like a shield-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bearer in the days of the Iliad, while Greaves and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Grimm came behind at a respectable distance, bearing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rifles at the ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As they drew near, I heard the professor cry out in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">excitement, "Why, it's a protozoan! Look, the nucleus,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and those cilia! And the triocysts! A single celled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">animal, by all that's holy! Related to Loxodes unless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I am mistaken." Simultaneously, Greaves and Grimm,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attracted by his words, drew a step nearer, and even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Howard lowered the sheet iron to peer at the animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And in that moment it happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With an indescribable swaying motion, the jelly-like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mass in the cage seemed to surge through the narrow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">opening in the cage, and as it surged, the air about it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was filled with the flash of those deadly darts. I heard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Howard cry out, I saw Grimm leap; a gun was dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">charged, and the sheet iron clanged on the sand. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there was silence and the brown mass in the cage oozed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slowly across the sand to the four dead men, who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">writhed for a moment and lay still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I think I must have gone a little mad in the nex?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moments. I can never recall quite accurately what hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pened. I remember only a paralyzing mist of horror,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the walls of my cabin. They tell me that the cove</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was found utterly empty save for the cage with its door</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shut tight ... I do not know ... I do not know. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">round ball, like the gall of feathers and bones found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by Greaves was picked up later on the beach. It held</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shattered human bones, a fragment of blue cloth and a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brass key, nothing more. I did not see it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Even today, the memory of the horror of that mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment gives me sleepless nights and days of shuddering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">All too clearly I recall the words of that brave and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gentle man who went to his death on the beach of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sala-y-Gomez, "When a type to replace man appears, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will be a direct evolution from the protozoa. . ." All</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">too clearly I remember his last words, and the desola-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion wrought by these animals on Easter Island and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through that great stretch of the Eastern Pacific known</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as the Agassiz triangle, and I wonder how long it will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fce before they invade the continents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It will be long, of that I am certain.

It will be repaired later--just help me re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">move it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt like a murderer as I followed him out through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the control room to the room where the motors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">located. We were in a narrow passageway when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinioned his arms to his sides and quickly tied the cord.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before he could wrench himself from my grasp I bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body and wrapped the cord about his feet. I se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured him and lay him on the deck, but I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">face him. I heard him breathing quick and short as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man meeting certain death, and then he said, "You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">a traitor. I should not have trusted you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was necessary," I said, and then I looked into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. It was the face of a man who awaited a tragedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">--in his case, obviously his return to earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never!" he hissed "Never, Metters, shall you take</seg><seg type="columnLine">me back to your hateful world. My daughter--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice fell short. He tried to wrench his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">free, but only succeeded in rising to a sitting posture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tried to speak, but he failed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT must have been his heart. I loosed his bonds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathed his head in cold water. Nothing seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help. I could not bring him back to life. An hour</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">later, when I was still working over him, Glorie came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my side. She fell beside him weeping. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time I heard her voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was his heart, Miss Hedron," I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It must have been," she answered tearfully.

I did not wish to discuss matters with her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I pulled down the elevator lever and turned on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. Thirty minutes later I looked through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness to see the lights of what appeared to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small town. I called Glorie who stood waiting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing back at the body of her father. She followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me aft to a door that had been sealed for three years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I took my pliers and wrenched the seal from the latch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opened it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I strike land, you must jump, Miss Hedron,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	directed.

I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glorie jump from the door. I closed the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine room where the body lay and quickly followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. The moment I touched ground I saw the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">phantom heave and lift into the void, back to the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">strata, back to the sky where she belonged, bearing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead burden. It was then that I wished I had secured</seg><seg type="columnLine">the formula for making the metal of which that ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was built. But I was concerned with something still</seg><seg type="columnLine">more important. Glorie stood waiting for me.

Usually his lens</seg><seg type="columnLine">was trained on a few of the spiral shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">microbes discovered in 1906 by the German zoologist</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schaudinn. Schaudinn named these microbes "Spiro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheta Pallida" and proved that they were the cause of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dread social disease that is the reward of sin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grey knew that Schaudinn had discovered these pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">germs that darted and corkscrewed their way across</seg><seg type="columnLine">their little world beneath his lens. He knew of the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Paul Ehrlich. He had read of Ehrlich's eight years</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for something to kill trypanosomes--those wrig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling, finned devils, who, if one includes all branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their family, are the cause of the dread sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickness, nagana and other diseases. He knew of David</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bruce's lifetime battle with the trypanosomes and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Glossina Morsitans and Glossina Palpalis--tsetse fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriers of nagana and sleeping sickness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grey idolized those men whose life history was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">corded in Paul de Kruif's book "Microbe Hunters,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">which held a prominent place on his desk. He, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brilliant Ehrlich, dreamed of conquering trypano-</seg><seg type="columnLine">somes and the spirochetes that Schaudinn claimed were</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely related to them. He had, in his few years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice, administered many doses of 606, or salversan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was the fruit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ehrlich's years of research,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knew that though</seg><seg type="columnLine">salversan saved thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">from death, insanity or</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse -- it occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed, seemingly without</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ehrlich had searched for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dye that would be harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less to man but would kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">the microbes that attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Grey, in this day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ultra-violet ray, sought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See, see," he would say to his friends. "If I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a ray that would kill microbes without in any way</seg><seg type="columnLine">affecting the human body--I could cure any germ dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease. I could cut an artery, insert a curved quartz tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such a manner that the blood would continue to flow</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the artery by way of my tube. Then, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart pumped the blood through the tube, my ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">--focused on the tube--would in a short time free the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood of microbes. Perhaps the ray would be power-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ful enough to pass through the body--X-rays do--then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	need not cut at all. Just by exposing the patient to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray, I could free his entire body of microbes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grey's laboratory was a maze of apparatus, a hodge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">podge of all kinds of lamps and projectors. He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">all kinds of rays on the germ cultures on his micro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope slides, and on inoculated white mice and guinea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pigs. He found that two frequencies in the ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet range would kill a few of the weaker microbes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the infinitely small, thin, curved tubercle bacilli, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirochetes, the trypanosomes and other of the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardy and malignant germs, were not in the least dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed by these rays, and they killed Grey's mice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guinea-pigs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grey, however, was not discouraged. He had a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice that supplied him with money. His rich friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">George Le Brun, an electrical wizard, who spent his</seg><seg type="columnLine">time designing and building outlandish apparatus for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey's experiments and getting hilariously drunk on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contents of a well stocked pre-prohibition cellar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aided and encouraged him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grey's day of days was coming--or perhaps it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be better to say his night of nights. Le Brun had put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finishing touches on an odd piece of apparatus in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to permit the variation of the vibratory fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quency of the rays given off by a new tube which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed, and had that day received from a company</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which specialized in making</seg><seg type="columnLine">that kind of experimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus. He worked un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til after midnight installing</seg><seg type="columnLine">this new tube, which looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an X-ray tube that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered from convulsions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grey and Le Brun looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to the trial of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube the next day.

Nine o'clock found</seg><seg type="columnLine">them both in Grey's laboratory. Grey had arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a colleague to handle his practice for the next few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days; had instructed his secretary that he was not, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der any circumstances, to be disturbed and he and Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brun had locked themselves in the little two-room build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the rear of his house. This building contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey's study and laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BOTH the doctor and Le Brun were visibly excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they stepped into the lead-sheathed X-ray con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol booth in which the control boards for all the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus were located.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A switch clicked--a knob turned beneath Le Brun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers and, while Grey and Le Brun watched through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thick window of the booth, a pale blue halo grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the tube. Swiftly it changed to a deep purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">haze that crept and writhed like smoke in a faint breeze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Brun cut off the current and the purple haze died</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Grey left the booth and placed a cage containing</seg><seg type="columnLine">some white mice and a guinea-pig directly beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Le Brun tube" where they would be fully exposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "El rays." (They had decided to name the tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">after Le Brun, who designed it, and its rays after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first letter in his name, El.) Grey then returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection of the control booth--they did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what effect the rays of the Le Brun tube would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">on animal life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For two hours the sinister, creeping, purple haze</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled over the surface of the Le Brun tube and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays poured down upon the guinea-pig and mice as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat blinking at the strange light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grey and Le Brun carefully examined the mice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guinea-pig but they seemed to be absolutely unaffected</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the El-rays. Satisfied that the rays were harmless</seg><seg type="columnLine">to animal life, and therefore to themselves, they began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn the rays upon germ cultures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day passed quickly and neither Le Brun nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey thought of lunch. Their ray was killing germs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The longer the exposure the more germs it killed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood of a guinea-pig which Grey had inoculated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubercle bacilli some weeks before--showed only dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">microbes after the guinea-pig had been exposed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple light for two hours. Watching germ cultures</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the lens of their microscopes, Le Brun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey could see a sudden cessation of activity among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wee creatures. They would fade and die. Only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardy, wriggling trypanosomes and their virulent cous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ins, the spirochetes, continued their activity, stubbornly</seg><seg type="columnLine">refusing to pay any attention to the rays from the Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brun tube.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grey and Le Brun stopped to eat about half past</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven that Friday evening, but were back at work in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour. It was about eleven o'clock, just as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were about to stop for a little well-earned rest, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grey--watching a germ culture of spirochetes through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his microscope--picked up a tiny ultra-violet ray pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jector and directed its beam, scarcely as large as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pencil, at the slide on the stage of his microscope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he watched through the microscope, the microbes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slide disappeared. Grey, tired and sleepy, annoyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he thought his lens were out of focus, swore</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. A glance, however, showed that the slide was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, that half of the stage and the substage condenser</seg><seg type="columnLine">were also missing. Grey swore again--this time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer amazement. The ultra-violet ray projector in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand was sending its invisible ray at the slate top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his laboratory table. Grey glanced at it and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed it at a tiny test tube of water. The test tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its contents vanished. Grey pointed the projector</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wall and a black line marked the course of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam as it moved across it. By this time Grey was</seg><seg type="columnLine">far too amazed to swear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Le Brun--at another table--was unaware of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happening. Grey switched off the projector and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood thinking. He had used that ray projector a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred times before and it had never caused any such</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary occurrences as these. Must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the combination of the two rays. Perhaps it only</seg><seg type="columnLine">made things invisible. He moved his hand through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space where the test tube had been, but touched nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He walked across to the wall and examined the gash</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the beam of ultra-violet light had left in it--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean cut through the composition wall board to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow tile of which the wall was made. Returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the table, he placed a cage containing a white mouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the slate top of the table; pointed the ultra-violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray projector at the slate top, switched it on and moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in an arc that crossed the cage and the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouse. The cage was cut in twain as if by an invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife. The head of the mouse vanished and its quiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering body lay bleeding on one side of the cage. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">few more passes of the little ultra-violet ray projector</seg><seg type="columnLine">and both mouse and cage had vanished as if under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence of a magician's wand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Going to the control booth, Grey shut off the Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brun tube, turning to watch it as the purple glow faded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he went into his study and brought out some white</seg><seg type="columnLine">mice that were in there. He placed one of the mice</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the slate table-top and turned the ultra-violet ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">projector on it. The mouse scurried around, wrinkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nose at his surroundings, quite unharmed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-violet rays. Shutting off the projector he put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Le Brun tube into operation agaiu, then directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rays of the little projector at the mouse. The mouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished instantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gone were all thoughts of microbes. Grey was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a child with a new and wonderful toy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, George," he called to Le Brun, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinkering with some apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a minute--soon as I get this vibrator adjusted."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Damn your vibrators and coils! Man, I have just</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the greatest discovery of the century."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Le Brun dropped his tools and hastened to Grey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under the rays from his tube and the little ultra-violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray projector he watched Grey send more mice and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of guinea-pigs into nothingness. A steel bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">was instantly severed, then by passing the ray along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar, Grey caused it to follow the mice and guinea-pigs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just think!" he said to Le Brun. "Imagine what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">step forward this will be in surgery--in mechanics.

He under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood how he could remove--say an appendix--by</seg><seg type="columnLine">causing the two rays to cross each other just at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appendix, but he could not remember how, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams, he had been able to see the rays inside the body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or how he had completed the operations after remov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the offending organs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside the sky was heavily overcast but the rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stopped. It was half past eight and the house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper had breakfast ready. Grey woke Le Brun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they snatched a light breakfast and hurried across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard to the laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the laboratory, a few more mice and guinea-pigs</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed away beneath the combination of rays. A cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a dog lost their tails. Under the rays wrent metals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood, liquids, paper, bakelite, everything that Grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">could lay his hands on, and all, except a bit of concrete,</seg><seg type="columnLine">articles made of clay and the slate of Grey's table-top,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About noon the clouds broke away and the sun shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly. The first intimation that Grey and Le Brun</seg><seg type="columnLine">had that all was not well was given by a strong draft</seg><seg type="columnLine">of air and a crash of glass and wood as a part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window and its framework disappeared and the rest fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grey, failing to comprehend what was happening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed to the window. The sunlight streaming through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hole where the window had been made a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">square of light on the concrete floor of the laboratory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Into this square of sunlight Grey rushed; tried to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turn, at the same time shrieking to Le Brun:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shut off the tube--ultra-violet rays in sunli--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ahhh!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as Le Brun looked, Grey's legs, bathed in sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light from the knees down, vanished, and the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of his body, turning away from the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the impulse of the effort made as he stepped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into the square of sunlight, fell into the sunlight that</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the window at an angle from above, and it, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared. Vanished--with the lower portion always</seg><seg type="columnLine">going first, so that Le Brun's last glimpse of his friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of his head, face contorted in agony and amaze,</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling toward the floor, yet vanishing before it touched.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurled into nothingness, just as the mice and guinea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pigs had been, by the rays from the Le Brun tube and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-violet rays; ultra-violet rays from that greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all ultra-violet ray generators--the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rushing to the control booth, Le Brun shut off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube that bore his name. Then, as full realization of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tragedy came to him, he fled from the laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps it would be best to say that he started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">flee from the laboratory, for as he rushed from the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">building into the sunlight, he, too, was hurled into eter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nity even as Grey had been. Mandy, Grey's colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">housekeeper, who was coming across the yard to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to lunch, vowed ever afterward that:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mistuh Le Brun's ghos' rushed out ob de do' and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished right befo' mah naked eyes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What Grey and Le Brun had failed to learn was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the rays from their new tube caused some intan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gible change in matter that made it susceptible to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution by the ultra-violet rays for an indefinite period,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not, as they believed, only while under the combined</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence of both rays. Grey died because he failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remember that the sun radiated ultra-violet rays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mandy's version of Le Brun's death gave the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">building a reputation of being haunted.

Further</seg><seg type="columnLine">corroboration was given by the hair-raising experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the four workmen hired by Grey's sister to remove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the furnishings from the laboratory and study.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These men, filled with forebodings by the tales told</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the laboratory, were rather shaky at first, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">regained their confidence as they removed Grey's desk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">couch, books, chairs and other effects from the study.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joking as they entered the laboratory, they removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Le Brun tube apparatus--a mass of tubes, coils,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meters and other electrical eouipment, mounted on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge bakelite panel. This apparatus weighed well over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter of a ton and taxed the combined strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the four of them to carry it. Out through the study</seg><seg type="columnLine">they staggered with their unwieldy burden; out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewalk and into the sunlight.

The pressure which</seg><seg type="columnLine">air exerts on any surface depends on the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that subject from the earth. As it is a fluid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it presses equally in all directions at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">levels. The top of a balloon is further from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth than its bottom. The air presses up against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the balloon with more pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">than it exerts in a downward direction on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper surface; therefore the balloon ascends. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is exactly the same as holds in the case of a float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing body immersed in water, the water presses</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon the immersed object less than it presses</seg><seg type="columnLine">upwards against it and hence the object rises. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balloon rises the air becomes lighter so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a while it reaches the place where it is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">equilibrium.

Hyatt Yerrill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There have been very few issues of Amazing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Stories which I have missed. There have been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still fewer of its stories that have failed to give</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me more than pleasure in the reading, but the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">last story by Mr. Verrill, "Into the Green Prism,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has surpassed them all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   In my humble opinion it is a masterpiece of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">literature in every respect. Its composition is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">impeccable. It is the acme of imagination tem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pered by a broad knowledge of varied subjects</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and, above all else, it is something that makes us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stop and think. Most of us, in a vague sort</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of way, know that under the microscope, there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are undreamed of wonders--wonders that have no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">place in our common, every day life except, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we occasionally think of "microbes" or "bacteria."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Verrill brings to us the thought: that which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in its infinite wisdom was able to create every-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing. As we know it, the universe in its vast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">intricate system, its varied Flora and Fauna,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from its most gigantic to its smallest microscopic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">size, may have been, for reasons or from causes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unknown to us, created on a scale so vast or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so minute as to be beyond the limits of human</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">realization."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   We are incapable of conceiving a race of human</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> beings, our equals, physically and mentally,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> dwarfed to the size of those portrayed by Mr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Verrill. Still, is there anyone who, with authority,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> can say, "It is impossible!" Improbable, I grant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, when we say impossible we place ourselves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> on a higher creative plane than that which did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> create what is, as we know it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   There is only one criticism I have to make to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Yerrill's "Into the- Green Prism." It is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reminiscent of a story published several years ago</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entitled, "The Lady or the Tiger," name of author</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   There is, I believe, in practically all of us,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> even the most mundane and prosaic, a streak of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sentiment that causes us to rebel at an incom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> plete romance, such as "The Lady or the Tiger,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> or "Into the Green Prism."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Instead, we want to see the romance brought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to a happy culmination. Therefore. I suggest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Verrill, through Don Alfeo, will make dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coveries that will enable us to know Ramon suc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in his attempt to join his Sumak Nusta.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Failing in this, he leaves incomplete the play</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of human emotions he has so ably portrayed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It is like stopping in the middle of a stanza of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> exquisite sweet music.

Really I get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tired trying to convince my friends that Amazing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Stories is not just cheap fiction as appearances</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are too much against it. The drawing as a rule</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is not so bad, but the color is awful. The stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as found in your magazine are on a high average.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In every magazine one finds a story once in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">while that's punk. Besides, tastes differ. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worst I've found in Amazing Stories in a long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">while is that "Sixth Glacier" by Marius. That</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fellow took too many liberties with physical laws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For instance: A glacier is formed through pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cipitation, so it can only grow according to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rain or snowfall. Then it travels in relation to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its growth, which can never be more than a few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yards a day. So express train speed is impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Furthermore: Such an ice cap would have to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come out of the oceans and ice caps such as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">describes would just about have dried up all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the oceans. Which disposes of his shipping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">projects. Then, even if the people could have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">utilized all the remaining power resources to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">melt the ice, it would have taken them centuries</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to make an impression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  About interplanetary travel: Do you know that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there is an old saga which says that long ago,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when humanity was still young, a space ship came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to earth in a blinding flash and a terrible roar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That it brought far advanced people who ruled and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taught the young humanity. That they brought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wheat, banauas and bees from their planet and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that for several centuries there was quite a traffic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">between Venus and Earth. That, as soon as they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had established a school and trained a staff of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rulers and teachers, the bulk of them went back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to Venus for good and that only four of them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">remained and became the real rulers of this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Another thing.
