            <seg type="columnLine"> Early travelers on the western prairie were at first puzzled by deep</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cuts frequently found in the heavy sod far from any stream or water course.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">One spring a hunter, stalking a small band of buffalo, advanced under cover</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to within a hundred yards of the group. Two bulls were industriously dig-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ging at the sod with their short, heavy horns and throwing the loose dirt</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">back over their bodies. When they tired of the play, others took their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">places. In a short time a trench was started. The animals were shed-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ding, and since there were no tree trunks against which they might rub</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">off their loose hair, they were making a place. Like all animals that shed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hair or wool, the buffalo likes to roll in the dirt, and the wallows were as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">popular among them as the rolling place is with horses and mules.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Buffalo wallows served the pioneers in many ways. At times suffi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cient water collected in them during a heavy rainfall so that a horSe could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be watered. They afforded ideal cover for hunters, and some of them were</seg>
