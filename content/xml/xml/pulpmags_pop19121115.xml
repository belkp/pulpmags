                <seg type="columnLine">the Forestport Bank and received the promise of the banker, Alexander Cobvale, to pay four per cent. He</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">returned to his mountain home satisfied that he had provided for old age. But Cobvale was a financial</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">sharper. The bank failed and the toun of Forestport was ruined. Cobvale, however, seemed to have</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">plenty of money, and removing to Cumberland established the Aqueduct Bond and Mortgage Company and</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">continued to add to his fortune. After thirty years Abner Coil, now grown old, decides that the time has</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">come for him to reclaim his money from Cobvale. True the Forestport Bank has failed, but the banker is</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">still alive and wealthy. So ofd Abner starts on the long tramp over the mountains to Cumberland^ At</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">last he i-eached the office of Cobvale and presents his.bank book. Cobvale laughs and tells him that the</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">bank has failed. "But you have money," persists the old man. Cobvale retorts that the fact of hia being</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">wealthy has nothing to do with the case. He tries to throw the mountain man out of the office, but Coil</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">suddenly pulls a gun and shoots the banker. He makes good his escape. Bolde, manager of a detective</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">agency, himsaLf a mountain man, is offered a big reward for the capture of the. murderer. Bolde follows</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">the trail over the mountains and reaches Forestport, where he himself lived years before. It is desertedp</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">but the bank building still stands. Searching there he finds an old ledger and other important documents</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">showing the rascality of Cobvale. Suddenly there is a glare in the sky and Forestport is in flames. As he</seg>
