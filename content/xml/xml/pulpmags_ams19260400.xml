                        <ab>AS I passed the President's office I could not help hearing my name. Instinctively I paused to listen. "That human clam," he was saying, "can't represent us. he's a hard
                            worker, but he seems to have no ability to express himself. I had hoped to make him a branch manager this fall, but he seems to withdraw farther and farther into his shell
                            all the lime. I've given up hopes of making anything out of him."</ab>
                        <ab>So that was it! That was the reason why I had been passed over time and again when promotions were being made! That was why I was just a plodder -- a truck horse for our
                            firm, capable of doing a lot of heavy work, but of no use where brilliant performance was required. I was a failure unless I could do what seemed impossible -- learn to use
                            words forcefully, effectively and convincingly.</ab>

                        <ab>And then suddenly I discovered a new, easy method which made me a powerful speaker almost overnight. I learned how to bend others to my will, how to dominate one man or an
                            audience of thousands. Soon I had on salary increases, promotion, popularity, power. Today I always have a ready flow of speech at my command. I am able to rise</ab>

                    <div type="column">

                        <ab>to any occasion, to meet any emergency with just the right words. And I accomplished all this by developing the natural power of speech possessed by everyone, hut
                            cultivated by so few -- by simply spending 15 minutes a day in the privacy of my own home, on this most fascinating subject.</ab>
                        <ab>There is no magic, no trick, no mystery about becoming a powerful and convincing talker. You, too, can conquer timidity, stage fright, self-consciousness and bashfulness,
                            winning advancement in salary, popularity, social standing, and success. Today business demands for the big, important high-salaried jobs, men who can dominate others -- men
                            who can make others do as they wish. It is the power of forceful, convincing speech that causes one man to jump from obscurity to the presidency of a great corporation ;
                            another from a small, unimportant territory to a sales manager's desk: another from the rank and file of political workers to a post of national importance; a timid,
                            retiring, self-conscious man to change almost overnight into a popular and much applauded after-dinner speaker. Thousands have accomplished just such amazing tilings
                            through this simple, easy, yet effective training.</ab>
